abstract = {Persuasive games are widely being implemented in the healthcare domain to drive behaviour change among individuals. Previous research has shown that there are differences in how males and females respond to persuasive attempts. However, there is little knowledge on whether gender moderates the effectiveness of persuasive games for health, specifically, games for promoting the adoption of COVID-19 precautionary measures. To address this gap, we designed COVID Pacman-R – a persuasive game to promote the adoption of COVID-19 precautionary measures. This paper presents the design and evaluation of COVID Pacman-R to examine its overall perceived persuasiveness as well as gender differences in persuasiveness to establish whether there is a need to tailor the game to various gender groups. Study results (N=131) revealed that the game is perceived as highly persuasive overall as well as by the different gender groups. The findings also revealed that there are no significant differences in the persuasiveness across gender groups with respect to COVID-19 ability to motivate them to adopt the precautionary measures.},

abstract = {Despite recent improvements, women remain underrepresented in Computer Science (CS) in both industry and higher education. Self-perception and identity play an important role in young women's opinions of careers in CS. We believe that by presenting software programming in a way that facilitates identity exploration early on, young girls will be more likely to consider careers in CS later in life. In partnership with an organization that focuses on technology education for middle school girls we developed a game design workshop in an effort to change young girls' perception of CS by increasing their knowledge of programming and empowering them to develop their own identities as computer scientists. This paper presents the results of a case study with 21 participants that was carried out to evaluate the workshop's short-term influence on young girls' attitudes towards CS. The study employed a mixed methods design, including a pre and post application of a validated survey instrument, focus-group interviews, and content analysis of games developed by the students. The pre and post surveys focused on how students' attitudes towards computing may have been influenced by their participation in the workshop; the focus-group interviews aimed to gain further insight into their workshop experience; and the content analysis of games focused on the learning outcomes of our workshop. The findings suggest that the workshop resulted in improvements in both young girls' attitudes towards CS as well as in their self-reported confidence and competence with computers. These results highlight the importance of providing positive identity exploration opportunities in shaping female students' attitudes towards CS. We investigated the impact of a game-design workshop on girls' attitudes towards computing.The workshop was designed according to the identity exploration framework.The activity included scaffolded use of professional-grade game development tools.Pre-post surveys, focus group interviews, and game content analysis were conducted for the evaluation.The results revealed that the workshop had positive influence on girls' attitudes towards computing.},

abstract = {This research to practice full paper presents the results from using a games design intervention to encourage diversity in the uptake of computer science by young people, explore stereotypes with them and increase their awareness of careers in the sector. The intervention is based on an integrated pedagogical framework appropriate for use with primary age school children (age 7 – 11 years). Despite the increasing use of technology, the percentage of young people taking up a computer science education-career path remains stubbornly low in the UK and across a number of other countries, particularly for females and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Previous research suggests that games can be used to generate interest and engage young people with computer science. Other studies advocate targeting young people at an earlier age (7 years or below) and sustaining engagement throughout their education to widen participation in a particular sector. In this intervention, young people designed and developed individual games through a three stage process: design and story development; game building; testing and evaluation. This research adopts elements from two pedagogical learning theories Direct Instruction and Cognitive Constructivism to create an integrated pedagogical framework to support the game creation process and enable effective learning. This provides an approach that can cater for a range of participants’ abilities along the novice-expert spectrum and provide an engaging and age appropriate educational experience.The intervention was completed in two cycles: cycle 1 consisted of a series of workshop sessions with 20 young people aged 9-10 years over a period of 5 weeks; and cycle 2 was a single session with 19 young people aged 7-11 years. A quasi-experimental approach was adopted for evaluating the intervention using the following instruments; pre and post questionnaires, planning sheets, the games created by the participants and a set of already developed engagement factors. Results show an increase from 5% to 25% in participants’ aspiration towards a computer science career. 45% of the young people also knew more careers in the game industry post-intervention. Girls chose a variety of diversity in their lead characters while boys chose mainly male human lead characters in the games that they designed. Participants’ evaluation of each other’s games using the engagement factors showed girls were more interested in receiving feedback than boys. This paper highlights the effectiveness of combining different learning approaches to provide an age appropriate intervention. It also presents evidence on the positive effect of using games in the classroom to explore stereotypes, and learn about, and encourage career choices in computer science.},

abstract = {Students' attitudes, their perceptions of cognitive and affective quality as predictors of attitudes, and the resulting intention toward learning with serious games remains ambiguous, largely due to the use of imprecise measures. The presented studies have aimed to develop and test a measurement of students' attitudes, perceptions, and intentions to learn with serious games in general, and to use the instrument to examine differences for the most common types of serious games, that is quiz, simulation, and adventure. To this end, a pretest (n = 301) and two main studies (Study 1: n = 135, Study 2: n = 375) were conducted. The developed instrument shows high reliability and convergent validity. Results demonstrate positive attitudes, positive cognitive perceptions, and high positive and low negative affective perceptions of students toward learning with serious games in general, as well as with different game types. Findings from a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), however, indicate differences between the three game types that could be related to the perceptions of cognitive and affective quality. Predominately, compared to quizzes and adventures, simulations were perceived as more supportive for the comprehension and application of knowledge while promoting a less positive affect. Additionally, there was a significant difference due to gender. Whereas females reported higher perceptions of negative affective quality compared to males when serious games were addressed in general, answers to questions about the specific game types revealed a more detailed picture. In contrast to previous findings in existing literature, female students reported a more positive attitude, as well as higher perceptions of positive affective quality, than males for all three game types. These results stress the importance of examining the types of serious games separately and considering gender when evaluating students' attitudes and perceptions when learning with serious games. The developed instrument showed high reliability and convergent validity.The instrument showed measurement invariance for different game types.Perceptions of cognitive and affective quality differed between game types.Gender differences appeared for perceptions of affective quality.},

abstract = {Violence and discrimination against women are serious problems that affect today's society regardless of culture or social environment. Educational and government programs addressing these gender issues are difficult to scale up, insufficient or, in some cases, nonexistent. Digital resources can contribute to address discrimination against women and different technological initiatives are being carried out around the world. Videogames and digital resources have proven their effectiveness as tools to educate, prevent and raise awareness about social problems. This article presents a systematic literature review of digital resources such as videogames, apps and simulations that address gender issues including violence and stereotypes. Throughout the review, we analyze multiple characteristics of the resources found (development tools, platforms, location, target audience) to classify the studies found. The main goal of this review is to present the status of gender-focused digital resources, their evaluation studies, including the metrics used and samples, as well as the acceptance and impact of their application. Most of the studies reviewed aimed to raise awareness about gender-based violence using serious games targeted at teenagers. For the resources evaluated, pre-post questionnaires were commonly used. However, many of the projects reviewed did not have evaluation studies or the resources were not openly available, thus limiting their massive application and their potential impact on society. We consider that our results provide a starting point to better understand the role of digital resources in raising awareness about gender issues, highlighting their current limitations, and providing recommendations for future research in gender-based digital resources.},

abstract = {Marta Kwiatkowska is a Professor of Computing Systems and a Fellow of Trinity College at the University of Oxford. Before joining the University of Oxford, she was Professor in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, Lecturer at the University of Leicester and Assistant Professor at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow, Poland. She holds a BSc/MSc in Computer Science from the Jagiellonian University, an MA from Oxford and a PhD from the University of Leicester. In 2014, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and she became an ACM Fellow in 2016. Marta Kwiatkowska has been a pioneer in the development of model checking for probabilistic and quantitative systems. She was one the proposers of the use of multiterminal binary decision diagrams for the symbolic analysis of probabilistic systems and has done fundamental work on many of the models of quantitative systems that have been studied in the literature, such as continuous time Markov chains, Markov decision processes and stochastic games, amongst others. A hallmark of Marta Kwiatkowska's research career has been the synthesis of innovative and rigorous theoretical work with significant real-world applications. In addition, she has the ability to forge successful research connections with scientists from other sciences. She has led the development of the highly influential PRISM model checker1, recognised through the HVC 2016 Award, and has identified applications of quantitative verification to a wide range of areas, including security protocols, nanotechnology designs, power management, planning, and systems biology. In the past few years she has focused on applying quantitative techniques to the verification of pervasive and ubiquitous computing through her ERC Advanced Grant VERIWARE "From software verification to everyware verification" In addition to her outstanding research achievements, Marta Kwiatkowska has served the theoretical computer science community by sitting on prestigious award committees, organizing conferences and workshops and, perhaps even more importantly, by acting as an inspiring mentor for young researchers and as a role model for female researchers in computer science, to whom she has provided support and guidance. To wit, Marta Kwiatkowska has been the Senior Member of OxWoCS (Oxford Women in Computer Science Society) since its foundation in 2013 and has been a source of continued support and encouragement for that student-led society, providing its leadership with advice and suggestions for events as well as mentoring OxWoCS Committee members. Another interesting initiative for women with which she was involved is Suffrage Science2, which deserves to be advertised more broadly (not least because it involves jewellery designs). In addition to being named as ACM Fellow for "contributions to the theory and practice of probabilistic verification", Marta Kwiatkowska is a member of Academia Europea and a Fellow of the British Computer Society. She is a true stalwart of the Logic in Computer Science research community and a great example for young researchers. It is therefore fitting to spotlight her contribution in this column of ACM SIGLOG News.},

abstract = {Computing education and careers are male dominated. Identifying strategies to reduce this gender gap would create a more diverse and inclusive workforce, and would respond to the growing importance of computing and technology in our society. This paper presents an intervention designed and conducted in a post-secondary polytechnic institution aimed at inspiring and motivating computer science education among high school girls. Grounded in theory and related research, this intervention was designed to address aspects recognized as having relevance to girls. Using the expectancy-value theory of motivation developed by Eccles as a theoretical foundation, this study explores the intervention's impact on participants' interest and attainment in computer science. Twenty five students (nineteen girls) from local high schools participated in this pre-questionnaire, intervention, post-questionnaire quasi-experimental study. Participants were mentored by post-secondary students (at least one mentor for each pair of participants) through activities including writing an algorithm, coding, exploring an AR/VR technology and practicing programming skills with an educational game. Analysis of resulting data revealed that girls who participated in this study experienced a high level of enjoyment, increased interest, perceived positive learning gains, and were inspired by their post-secondary mentors. Post-questionnaire responses indicated that girls improved their ability beliefs and reduced their stereotypical views.},

abstract = {This article describes the work in progress of a PhD candidate who investigates how Learning through construction (LtC) affects the formation of identity in students. Thematic qualitative study with principles of constructivist Grounded Theory aims to investigate what the students experience in the context of LtC, and how they are affected by these experiences? So far, several questions regarding research methodology and theoretical framework have emerged. Those issues are described and discussed in this article and are as follows: finding appropriate time to include theory in GT research, conceptualizing identity and defining aspects of identity relevant for the study, approaching topics in a broad manner versus narrowing down and presenting in detail just one specific fragment of the current study. Results from a preliminary analysis of four interviews with students from Games and Entertainment Technology university study program are presented as well. The research focuses on students’ experiences during GameLab, a course where they work in groups and construct games. Preliminary results suggest that choice of studies is made based on personal interest and passion for gaming. LtC courses illustrate to students the complexity of the work in Game industry and the variety of jobs that exist in that industry. Even though there are many options to choose from, students are particularly interested in becoming Game Designers. Their chosen role performed in the context of GameLab is influenced by their previous experiences, and it affects the nature of their contribution to group projects. Students benefit from being part of a group that promotes the sharing of ideas, and this leads to better products. In particular, female involvement affects the diversity of the product characteristics.},

abstract = {I surveyed 366 adolescents (13-17years) about their technology use and sexual development.I examined which technologies mediate changes in sexual development over a two-year period.Higher levels of texting were linked to gains in oral sex and sexual intercourse experience over time. PurposeFew studies link technology use to normative sexual outcomes despite concerns that high use may be accelerating sexual development. This study used longitudinal online survey data to predict sexual development (having had a boyfriend or girlfriend, first oral sex, first intercourse) and tests for mediation by four types of technology use common among adolescents: texting (from a mobile phone), general Internet/computer use, video gaming, and watching television. MethodsParticipants were 366 adolescents (37% male; 13-17years) from eight Eastern Canadian high schools. All participants completed a range of measures assessing demographic information, sexual and relationship histories, and recent use of technologies. Participants (72%) completed the survey at a follow-up assessment two years later. ResultsAfter adjusting for age, higher levels of texting mediated the relationships in reports of both oral sex and sexual intercourse over time. The association between texting and sexual intercourse was moderated by parental closeness. No other technology was linked to sexual outcomes. ConclusionsTexting appears to have unique features not shared by the other technologies, possibly related to its highly interactive nature. Insights regarding these outcomes are of value given the rapid uptake of new technologies by youth. Findings are discussed in terms of the role of technology in helping to meet intimacy and relational needs common to adolescents.},

There are eleven hypotheses generated for the model. The data is collected via numerous instruments proven as reliable and valid by the previous studies. There are 159 undergraduate students as participants of the study. Antecedent variables are socio-economic status (SES), computer-ownership, gender, smoking, online and computer gaming, mothers' employment and education level. Consequence variables are grade point average, self-esteem, and self-confidence. The results indicates that socio-economic status, smoking, online gaming, computer gaming, and mother employment status increased game addiction; whereas, gender (female) and mother education level decreased game addiction. SES, gender, online and computer gaming affect game addiction significantly; smoking, mothers' employment status and education level do not have a significant impact. For the consequences, game addiction decreases significantly GPA and Self-Esteem; it does not influence significantly in self-confidence. Parents and educational institutions may be illuminated about prevention or monitoring of excessive online or computer game playing. Further research studies and implications are presented and discussed. Game addiction decreases academic performance.Game addiction hinders self-esteem and self-confidence.Computer gaming mostly preferred to other activities may cause game addiction.Males are more prone to be game addict than girls.},

abstract = {This paper presents the findings of a literature review on smart technologies for neurodiverse users. The analysis of the literature indicates that most technologies implemented consist of games to train neurodiverse individuals on self-regulation, attention, and communication skills. The studies are conducted in the field, often involving a limited number of participants. The age of the participants is skewed towards children and the gender of the participant sample is predominantly male. The studies combine mixed-methods, including observations, interviews, and usability evaluations. The participants include end users, as well as caregivers and practitioners. Neurodiversity is prevalent, and emerging technologies are promising to assist neurodiverse individuals in their daily activities. Despite the importance of involving neurodiverse users in the technology design, guidance for investigators to conduct inclusive studies is currently limited. This paper provides concrete recommendations for practitioners seeking to design UX studies to include neurodiverse users.},

abstract = {Video game preferences of 58 adults with autism spectrum disorder were examined.Game play motives included stress relief, immersion, time use, and social connection.Participants reported enjoying achievement, creativity, story, and game graphics.Addiction and negative social interactions were identified as negative game aspects.Many participants disliked game violence, sexual content, and game design problems. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience significant challenges in community engagement and social activities, yet they have strong interests in video games. Thus, there has been increasing interest in understanding potentially positive and negative effects of video games in this population. However, research has not yet examined the perspectives of individuals with ASD themselves on this topic. The purpose of this study was to use qualitative methods to examine the preferences and motivations for video game play among adults with ASD. Individual interviews were conducted with 58 adults with ASD, and responses were coded through an iterative and collaborative process. Several themes were identified, including perceived benefits of video game use (e.g., social connection, stress reduction) as well as perceived negative effects (e.g., time use, addictive potential). Participants also noted both positive and negative aspects of game design that affect their overall enjoyment. The most frequent all-time favorite video game genres were Role-Playing (31%) and Action-Adventure (19%). These qualitative findings enhance our understanding of video game use from the direct perspectives of individuals with ASD, and suggest a need for incorporating these perspectives in future quantitative studies on positive and negative aspects of game use in this population.},

abstract = {As new technologies have emerged in the last few years, the learning process has been changing. New and powerful e-learning systems are being developed and new teaching methods can be used in classrooms. In this paper, we present a computer-based game with an educational background that is played on a large-size tabletop display. The game can be used as reinforcement for educational content related to historical ages. The game uses natural interaction. A study to compare the traditional learning method with a collaborative learning method using the game was carried out. A group of up to 12 children could learn together using the game. The experience of children in large groups was also compared with the experience of children playing in pairs. One hundred children between 8 and 11 years old participated in the study; they were divided into three groups (LGroup, Pairs, TClass). When the pre-test and the post-test results were compared, it was shown that the children learned the contents in all three groups. The results also showed that there were statistically significant differences between the traditional method and the game played in a large group in favour of children who played the game in the large group. The knowledge acquired was independent from gender and age. There were no statistically significant differences between learning in large groups or learning in pairs. In both cases, the children expressed their satisfaction for the game and found it easy to use. Therefore, playing games of this type collaboratively in large groups or in pairs can be a valuable learning method that can be combined with traditional methods. The effects of computer-based games and collaboration in large groups were studied.The differences between a computer-based game and traditional methods were studied.The acquired knowledge was statistically significant in favor of the game.The differences between playing in large groups and playing in pairs were studied.The acquired knowledge was not significant different between large groups or pairs.},

abstract = {This paper uses an algorithm of a genetic neural network to conduct an in-depth study and analysis of the attention relationship in pre-school education of young children. In face expression images, expression features are often concentrated and distributed in some local regions, while convolutional neural networks are homogeneous for feature extraction of facial expression images. To address the problem of the nonuniform distribution of expression features, a facial expression recognition method based on the spatial domain attention mechanism is proposed. A comparison of the differences between group and grade before the intervention using a two-way multivariate ANOVA revealed a nonsignificant interaction effect with a value of 0.90 for the group-grade interaction effect and an F-value of 0.36. The group’s main effect had a value of 0.90 and an F-value of 0.36, with the experimental and control groups being equal groups on multiple dependent variables. The salient features in face expression images that are more important for facial expression recognition can be selected adaptively, and relatively high weights are assigned to these salient features. Experimental results on the image library show that the introduction of a spatial domain attention mechanism can improve the average recognition accuracy of face expressions by about 1.1% and 1.0%, respectively. A hybrid domain attention mechanism-based face expression recognition method is proposed to extract important expression features from both the spatial domain and the channel domain. Experimental results on the image library show that combining the spatial domain attention mechanism and the channel domain attention mechanism can improve the average recognition accuracy by about 2.1% and 1.5%, respectively. The use of rule games was effective in developing children’s sustained and selective attention; the effect of rule games on the sustained and selective attention of older boys and girls did not show significant gender differences.},

abstract = {This presentation will detail the results of two studies done for the purpose of investigating the Uncanny Valley in virtual character modeling, and present the results in the context of research from other disciplines. The emphasis of the presentation will be on translating the results to provide information for character designers and modelers.Media critics including The New York Times, Wired Magazine, and ESPN have mentioned Dr. Masahiro Mori's theory of the Uncanny Valley in reviews of film and video games. The concept involves the negative reaction some people experience when seeing real world robots or virtual 3-d models of humans that are intended to be very realistic. This increasingly common concept comes from robotics, and most direct investigation of the theory has been done with robots, not virtual characters.The original Uncanny Valley paper presented a theorized relationship between familiarity and human appearance. Mori's original 1970 paper begins with the idea that the relationship between how human a robot looks and how positively people will regard its appearance is a positive one. The main concept is that this positive relationship temporarily turns extremely negative for robots that look very human but aren't totally so.The two studies at the center of this submission were designed to investigate the design of virtual agents for the screen, and provide information for character designers. The first asked sixty research subjects to evaluate seventy five video game and animation characters, including humans, robots, anthropomorphized animals and others. The initial findings of this first study were presented at SIGGRAPH's Sandbox Symposium in 2007, a more detailed contextual analysis will be presented here. The second study looked at a more specific group of characters, the humanoid characters of Second Life. While the first study gave details about the relationship between human appearance and attraction in a wide range of characters, the second provides more specific information on the design of human characters.Data analysis from these studies provided a fountain of information that would be of use to any character modeler. The first study using a wider range of characters showed a clear relationship between subjects' opinion on human-like appearance and attraction. The relationship found was more complex than the one from the original Mori paper, but supported the Valley idea. The data from the second study also was found to be supportive of the concept, and analysis provided insight into how character gender, use of texture, level of facial detail, and other design decisions influenced the relationship.Research on virtual character design will be used to provide a third perspective on the Uncanny Valley. Human reaction to virtual agents has been explored in areas such as psychology, computer science, telecommunications, and instructional technology. The most relevant studies from these areas will be used to put the studies' results in context for designers.},

abstract = {Affect detection is a key component in intelligent educational interfaces that respond to students’ affective states. We use computer vision and machine-learning techniques to detect students’ affect from facial expressions (primary channel) and gross body movements (secondary channel) during interactions with an educational physics game. We collected data in the real-world environment of a school computer lab with up to 30 students simultaneously playing the game while moving around, gesturing, and talking to each other. The results were cross-validated at the student level to ensure generalization to new students. Classification accuracies, quantified as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), were above chance (AUC of 0.5) for all the affective states observed, namely, boredom (AUC = .610), confusion (AUC = .649), delight (AUC = .867), engagement (AUC = .679), frustration (AUC = .631), and for off-task behavior (AUC = .816). Furthermore, the detectors showed temporal generalizability in that there was less than a 2% decrease in accuracy when tested on data collected from different times of the day and from different days. There was also some evidence of generalizability across ethnicity (as perceived by human coders) and gender, although with a higher degree of variability attributable to differences in affect base rates across subpopulations. In summary, our results demonstrate the feasibility of generalizable video-based detectors of naturalistic affect in a real-world setting, suggesting that the time is ripe for affect-sensitive interventions in educational games and other intelligent interfaces.},

abstract = {Background. Over the past ten years, we carried out several comprehensive studies in the area of entrepreneurship education using business games that simulate the business processes of startups. The studies researched the learning effects of these games on German university students.Aim. The studies we present investigated if the simulation game-based educational entrepreneurship programs in Germany reached their goals. These goals included the fostering of participants' entrepreneurial competencies and desire to create a startup.Method. We show traditional summative output-oriented results and more profound results based on our theory-based evaluation approach. A so-called logic model provides a framework for the interpretation of what takes place during the entrepreneurship business simulations. Currently, we have conducted research on more than 50 regular university courses with more than 1000 students. Another part of our studies is the evaluation of entrepreneurship education in the German national business game-based competition, EXIST priME Cup further called EPC. More than 12,000 students attended more than 500 of these cup seminars. We also show new results from an online survey that was carried out to measure the long-term effects of the startup simulation-based seminars.Results. The results of five studies are summarized, and show an overall increase in the participants' knowledge of business administration and business plan preparation skills required in start-up context. Apart from other results, significant gender-based differences are identified. The differences relate to entrepreneurial attitudes and motivation. Some test scenarios with cup seminars for women only with extended debriefing seem to reduce this decrease in the motivation of women; further research with larger samples is necessary. A new study on the long-term effects shows a very high acceptance rate and demonstrates the satisfaction of former students. The simulation game-based program resulted in participants starting startups at a rate that is approximately twice as high around 16% as the normal rate in Germany.},

abstract = {Serious games are supposed to instigate engagement and, in turn, improve learning. High engagement is frequently connected with a positive affective state and a high flow state. However, the alleged link between a learner's affective state, his/her flow state and learning outcomes has not been investigated in detail in the context of serious games. Even less information is available on how serious games may influence markers of physiological arousal. To fill this gap, participants of this exploratory study (N = 171) played one of the six different serious game-based treatments, while we measured their affect, flow, cortisol secretion and learning achievement. The treatments were supposed to generate different levels of engagement and cortisol responses, because some of them were designed for a single user, while others were team-based, featuring so-called social-evaluative threat (ST) components. Our results revealed that flow was positively related to positive affect and negatively to negative affect. While flow and positive affect were related to learning gains, almost no relationship between either of these three variables and cortisol levels was found. Negative affect and cortisol were elevated in social interaction anxious males in team-based conditions. This study contributes to the limited body of research on the relationship between engagement and learning in serious games. We provide new perspectives on the relationships between flow, positive/negative affect and cortisol. Our findings highlight the fact that team-based serious games with ST components may have adverse effects on learners, particularly males, with high social interaction anxiety. We studied the link between affect, flow, cortisol secretion and learning achievement.Learners participated in one of the six different serious game-based treatments.Flow was positively related to positive affect and negatively to negative affect.Flow/positive affect was related to achievement, but not to cortisol levels.Cortisol was elevated in social interaction anxious males in team-based conditions.},

In addition, the nature and extent of cyberspace risks associated with adolescents of different age groups and gender is yet to be fully understood. ICTs are a critical developmental tool but if not handled with caution, they can be harmful. This study researched on ICTs use and misuse by adolescents based in Namibia. Focus was on establishing cyberspace risks that adolescents are exposed to. A quantitative research methodology was used. About 729 respondents from urban and rural areas were engaged during data collection. The respondents' age ranged from thirteen to seventeen years. ICT uses and common cyberspace risks were analysed according to age and gender. Findings show that mobile phones are widely used for accessing the Internet. When online, adolescents prefer social networking, watching movies, playing games, researching health-related issues and doing school work among other activities. Observed cyberspace risks include cyberbullying and sexual abuse-oriented risks. In addition, adolescents across all genders are open to befriending strangers online and they consider sharing contact details with strangers. While cyberspace risks are common across gender and age groups, female adolescents appear more prone to cyberspace risks. Results also show that exposure to cyberspace risks increase with age. These study findings can be critical in informing the development of policy frameworks aimed at protecting children from cyberspace risks.},

abstract = {3D digital models have become an important part of diverse applications ranging from computer games, virtual reality, architectural design to visual impact studies. One common method to create 3D models is to create a point cloud using laser scanners, structured lighting sensors, or image-based modelling techniques, and then construct a 3D mesh, and texture-map it using photographs of the observed scene. Attributed to the inherent properties of general 3D scenes such as occluded or inaccessible parts, reflective surfaces, lighting conditions or poor-quality inputs, 3D models produced by these approaches often exhibit unsatisfactory and erroneous mesh regions. In many cases, it is desirable to identify and extract such regions so that they can be constructed or corrected through other means. While much effort has been invested into the problem of 3D reconstructions, the task of evaluating existing models and preparing them for subsequent enhancement processes has been largely neglected. In this paper, we present a novel method for automatically detecting and segmenting mesh regions with low confidence in their correctness. The confidence estimation is achieved by exploiting and integrating various uncertainty measures such as geometric distances, normal variations and texture discrepancies. Low-confidence mesh regions are isolated and removed in such a way that the extracted region's boundary is as simple as possible in order to facilitate subsequent automatic or manual improvement of these regions. Segmentation is achieved by minimising an energy function that takes the genus and boundary length and smoothness of the extracted regions into account.},

At the same time, strategically orchestrated play experiences may offer a potential means of counteracting this pressure. In the present research, a pair of randomized experiments, involving a strategy game that puts players in the role of princesses, revealed a positive impact of delaying the timing of the revelation of the characters' gender (Study 1) and reducing the degree of femininity of the illustrated representation of the characters (Study 2) on boys' evaluations of the game, level of experience-taking (identification and role assumption) with the princess characters, and shift in both gender perceptions and self-perceptions. Together, these findings illustrate that strategic design choices can facilitate boys' adoption of cross-gender personae and open the door to malleability in adherence to rigid gender roles and norms.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) developers create experiences that result in both gender dysphoria and euphoria for Transgender and Genderqueer individuals. Avatar Creation Interfaces (ACIs) and the game mechanics associated with them engage with these effects. Since all experiences in VR begin with a body in space, ACI mechanics can inform a more inclusive experience for Transgender and Genderqueer individuals. Research of ACIs’ effects on people with gender dysphoria and euphoria is limited and does not address the subject in VR. Given this knowledge gap, research on the euphoric and dysphoric effects of embodiment that Transgender and Genderqueer individuals have within VR is constructive. To this end, as part of a qualitative study, survey data from 29 individuals and interview data from 7 of those individuals were analyzed using the emergent method of grounded theory analysis. The data suggest that ACI VR experiences that give interactors creative agency, greater gender diversity, and the opportunity to be embodied in mundane and gender-affirming situations are dysphoria relieving and euphoria inducing.},
