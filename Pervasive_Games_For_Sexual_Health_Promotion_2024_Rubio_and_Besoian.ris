TI  - A BEME systematic review of teaching interventions to equip medical students and residents in early recognition and prompt escalation of acute clinical deteriorations: BEME Guide No. 62
IS  - 7
VL  - 42
AB  - Background: Current educational interventions and teaching for acute deteriorations seem to address acute care learning in discreet segments. Technology enhanced and team training methodologies are in vogue though well studied in the nursing profession, teaching avenues for junior ‘doctors in training’ seem to be a lacuna. Aims: The BEME systematic review was designed to (1) appraise the existing published evidence on educational interventions that are intended for ‘doctors in training’ to teach early recognition and prompt escalation in acute clinical deteriorations (2) to synthesise evidence & to evaluate educational effectiveness. Methodology: The method applied was a descriptive, justification & clarification review. Databases searched included PubMed, PsycINFO, Science Direct and Scopus for original research and grey literature with no restrictions to year or language. Abstract review, full text decisions and data extraction were completed by two primary coders with final consensus by a third reviewer. Results: 5592 titles and abstracts were chosen after removal of 905 duplications. After exclusion of 5555 studies, 37 full text articles were chosen for coding. 22 studies met final criteria of educational effectiveness, relevance to acute care. Educational platforms varied from didactics to blended learning approaches, small group teaching sessions, simulations, live & cadaveric tissue training, virtual environments and insitu team-based training. Translational outcomes with reduction in long term (up to 3–6 years) morbidity & mortality with financial savings were reported by 18% (4/22) studies. Interprofessional training were reported in 41% (9/22) of studies. Recent evidence demonstrated effectiveness of virtual environment and mobile game-based learning. Conclusions: There were significant improvements in teaching initiatives with focus on observable behaviours and translational real patient outcomes. Serious game-based learning and virtual multi-user collaborative environments might enhance individual learners’ cognitive deliberate practice. Acute care learning continuum with programmatic acute care portfolios could be a promise of the future. © 2020 AMEE.

TI  - Academic methods for usability evaluation of serious games: a systematic review
IS  - 4
VL  - 76
AB  - In the last years, there has been an increasing interest in the design of video games as a tool for education, training, health promotion, socialization, etc. Usability, which is a key factor in any video game, becomes even more important in these so-called “serious games”, where the users’ special characteristics should be considered, and the game efficacy depends on the users’ adherence and engagement. However, evaluation of the usability of this kind of games requires a redefinition of techniques, methods and even terminology. In this paper, we elicit six research questions and conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature, which resulted in the selection of 187 papers that contained the most relevant responses. The conclusions of this systematic review illustrate the general status of current academic usability evaluations of these games and the main trends in the selection of methodologies and how are they applied. This view may be a very valuable foundation for future research. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - A Case Study Evaluating Youth Acceptability of <i>Using the Connect</i>
- a Sexuality Education Game-Based Learning Program
IS  - 1
VL  - 17
AB  - Game-based learning offers an interactive and effective way to teach
health content and skills. This article discusses feasibility testing of
Using the Connect (UTC), an innovative, game-based sexuality education
program to evaluate its acceptability among youth. Utilizing mixed
methods in a single case study design, qualitative and quantitative data
was collected from youth (surveys, facilitated discussions, and
observations). Qualitative data triangulated quantitative findings that
youth liked the program design, felt the games and content were
relatable, and learned knowledge and skills around adolescent
development, accessing information, communication, and making healthy
decisions through playing the games. Overall, UTC was highly acceptable
to the youth; they had fun and learned information and skills. Not only
would most participants recommend the program to friends, all reported
they would participate in the program again and use the information they
learned in the future.

TI  - A case study on vocabulary learning strategies in Malaysia: implications for teaching and learning
IS  - 1
VL  - 15
AB  - Within the context of learning English for specific purposes (ESP), vocabulary acquisition plays a crucial role in the development of written and spoken communication in both technical and non-technical industries. Thus, the use of vocabulary learning strategies would determine both learners fluency as well as confidence in communicating. This paper analyzes the factor structure of the most frequently used vocabulary learning strategies by Malaysian ESL learners studying at a higher learning institution. A confirmatory factor analysis identified vocabulary learning strategy use as a 3-factor structure, with Dictionary Use, Memory Rehearsal and Activation strategies as the underlying constructs, based on the responses of 201 undergraduates. The instrument used was a 27-item questionnaire, adapted from Gu Johnsons Vocabulary Learning Strategies Questionnaire (VSLQ). Results indicate a good model fit model fit with a chi-square statistic (? = 64.3, df= 32) with p .001 and CMIN/df = 2.010, CFI = .946 and GFI = .939. The implications of the findings are discussed, and suggested practices for implementing vocabulary learning strategies in the language classroom, such as mobile-assisted language learning and game-based language learning; are presented. © 2019 Asian EFL Journal Press.

TI  - Acceptability of video games technology for medical emergency training
IS  - 4
VL  - 5
AB  - Using the technology acceptance model (TAM), this study aimed to investigate the acceptability of video game technologies (serious games) for medical emergency procedure and decision making training. Using the Triage Trainer, a prototype serious game for the triage sieve process, differences between gamers and non-gamers, males and females, and the effects of ratings of computer self efficacy (i.e. computer skill and gaming skill) and attitudes towards computers (i.e. enthusiasm and anxiety) on the acceptance model were also investigated. The results show significant correlations for computer self-efficacy and attitude variables with the perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU) and attitudes towards use (ATU) of the game. Multiple regression showed that 52% of the variance in ATU was explained by the PU and PEOU. However, none of the secondary variables (self efficacy or emotions) had a significant effect on the ATU, PU and PEOU over and above each other. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.

TI  - Accurate judgments of intention from motion cues alone: A cross-cultural study
IS  - 4
VL  - 26
AB  - One of our most fundamental cognitive adaptations is the ability to infer the intentions of others. Whole-body motion is a reliable, valid, easily perceived source of information about intentions because different kinds of intentional action have different motion signatures. In this study, we report four experiments that examined the ability of German adults, German children, and Shuar adults from Amazonian Ecuador to distinguish, on the basis of motion cues alone, between six categories of intentional interaction: Chasing, fighting, courting, following, guarding, and playing. Naturalistic motion trajectories were elicited from untutored participants in a game-like situation with performance-based monetary payoffs and were categorized by other participants in a forced-choice design. On a six-category task, German adults correctly categorized intention 75% of the time (where 17% represents chance performance). On a four-category judgment task, children's performance was above chance by age 4, with a mean of 64% correct. A final study compared the judgments of German adults with those of Shuar hunter-horticulturalists. Performance was identical and well above chance in both populations, suggesting that cognitive adaptations for inferring intention from motion deserve further research as possible universal components of human psychology. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A cloud game-based educative platform architecture: The cyberscratch project
IS  - 2
VL  - 11
AB  - The employment of modern technologies is widespread in our society, so the inclusion of practical activities for education has become essential and useful at the same time. These activities are more noticeable in Engineering, in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, etc. Additionally, these activities acquire even more relevance with a distance education methodology, as our case is. The inclusion of these practical activities has clear advantages, such as (1) promoting critical thinking and (2) improving students’ abilities and skills for their professional careers. There are several options, such as the use of remote and virtual laboratories, virtual reality and gamebased platforms, among others. This work addresses the development of a new cloud game-based educational platform, which defines a modular and flexible architecture (using light containers). This architecture provides interactive and monitoring services and data storage in a transparent way. The platform uses gamification to integrate the game as part of the instructional process. The CyberScratch project is a particular implementation of this architecture focused on cybersecurity game-based activities. The data privacy management is a critical issue for these kinds of platforms, so the architecture is designed with this feature integrated in the platform components. To achieve this goal, we first focus on all the privacy aspects for the data generated by our cloud game-based platform, by considering the European legal context for data privacy following GDPR and ISO/IEC TR 20748-1:2016 recommendations for Learning Analytics (LA). Our second objective is to provide implementation guidelines for efficient data privacy management for our cloud game-based educative platform. All these contributions are not found in current related works. The CyberScratch project, which was approved by UNED for the year 2020, considers using the xAPI standard for data handling and services for the game editor, game engine and game monitor modules of CyberScratch. Therefore, apart from considering GDPR privacy and LA recommendations, our cloud game-based architecture covers all phases from game creation to the final users’ interactions with the game. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - A comprehensive review on emerging trends in the dynamic evolution of digital addiction and depression
VL  - 14
AB  - Introduction: Using digital addiction as an umbrella term to cover any type of addictions to digital technologies such as the internet, smartphones, social media, or video games, the current study aimed to reveal the intellectual structure and evolution of research addressing digital addiction-depression relationship. Methods: The study combined bibliometric and science mapping analysis methods for this purpose. Data for the study was gathered from Web of Science Core Collection after a comprehensive process of data search/extraction, and 241 articles were included in the final data set. A period-based, comparative science mapping analysis was performed using the SciMAT software. Results: The analysis of data over three periods, Period 1 (1983-2016), Period 2 (2017-2019), and Period 3 (2020-2022) showed that internet addiction was the most significant theme across all three periods, which was followed by social media addiction. Depression, which emerged as a significant theme during Period 1, was later covered under anxiety disorder theme. Research interest was mostly on factors related to both addiction and depression such as cognitive distortion, insomnia, loneliness, self-esteem, social support, alexithymia, as well as cybervictimization or academic performance. Discussion: The results suggested that much research is warranted on the digital addiction-depression relationship in different age cohorts, especially children and elderly. Similarly, the current analysis showed that this line of research particularly focused on internet, gaming and social media addiction, and evidence with regard to other types of digital addiction or related compulsive behaviors was almost absent. In addition, research was mostly inclined to understanding cause-effect relationships, which is significant, but preventive strategies seemed to be barely addressed. Likewise, the smartphone addiction-depression relationship arguably garnered less research interest, so future research would contribute to the field in this respect.

TI  - Active Video Games Improve Muscular Fitness and Motor Skills in Children with Overweight or Obesity
IS  - 5
VL  - 19
AB  - (1) Background: Childhood obesity is an important public health problem. Children with overweight or obesity often tend to show the pediatric inactivity triad components; these involve exercise deficit disorder, pediatric dynapenia, and physical illiteracy. The aim of the study was to examine the influence of an active video games (AVG) intervention combined with multicomponent exercise on muscular fitness, physical activity (PA), and motor skills in children with overweight or obesity. (2) Methods: A total of 29 (13 girls) children (10.07 ± 0.84 years) with overweight or obesity were randomly allocated in the intervention group (AVG group; n = 21) or in the control group (CG; n = 8). The intervention group performed a 5-month AVG training using the Xbox 360® with the Kinect, the Nintendo Wii®, dance mats, and the BKOOL® interactive cycling simulator, combined with multicomponent exercise, performing three sessions per week. The control group continued their daily activities without modification. Weight, PA using accelerometers, and motor competence using the Test of Gross Motor Development 3rd edition were measured. Muscular fitness was evaluated through the Counter Movement Jump height, maximal isometric strength of knee extension and handgrip strength, and lean mass using Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry. Mann–Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed. The biserial correlation coefficients (r) were calculated. Spearman’s correlation coefficients among PA, muscular fitness, and motor competence variables were also calculated. (3) Results: The AVG group significantly increased their knee extension maximal isometric strength (4.22 kg; p < 0.01), handgrip strength (1.93 kg; p < 0.01), and jump height (1.60 cm; p < 0.01), while the control group only increased the knee extension maximal isometric strength (3.15 kg; p < 0.01). The AVG group improved motor competence and light physical activity (p < 0.05) and decreased sedentary time (p < 0.05). Lean mass improved in both AVG group and CG (p < 0.05). Lastly, the percentage of improvement of motor skills positively correlated with the percentage of improvement in vigorous PA (r = 0.673; p = 0.003) and the percentage of improvement in CMJ (r = 0.466; p = 0.039). (4) Conclusions: A 5-month intervention combining AVG with multicomponent training seems to have positive effects on muscle fitness, motor competence, and PA in children with overweight or obesity. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - ADAPTING A MULTIFACETED US HIV PREVENTION EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR GIRLS IN
GHANA
IS  - 1
VL  - 21
AB  - We adapted a U.S. HIV prevention program to address knowledge gaps and
cultural pressures that increase the risk of infection in adolescent
Ghanaian girls. The theory-based nine-module HIV prevention program
combines didactics and games, an interactive computer program about
sugar daddies, and tie-and-dye training to demonstrate an economic
alternative to transactional sex. The abstinence-based study was
conducted in a church-affiliated junior secondary school in Nsawam,
Ghana. Of 61 subjects aged 10-1.4 in the prevention program, over two
thirds were very worried about becoming HIV infected. A pre-post
evaluation of the intervention showed significant gains in three
domains; HIV knowledge (p =.001) and self efficacy to discuss HIV and
sex with men (p <.001) and with boys (p <.001). Responses to items about
social norms of HIV risk behavior were also somewhat improved (p =.09).
Subjects rated most program features highly. Although short-term
knowledge and self-efficacy to address HIV improved significantly,
longer term research is needed to address cultural and economic factors
placing young women at risk of HIV infection.

TI  - A Design-Led Theory of Change for a Mobile Game App (Go Nisha Go) for Adolescent Girls in India: Multimix Methodology Study
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: India has one of the largest adolescent populations in the world. Yet adolescents, particularly adolescent girls, have limited access to correct sexual and reproductive health information and services. The context in which adolescent girls live is one of gender inequity where they contend with early marriage and early pregnancy and have few opportunities for quality education and labor force participation. The digital revolution has expanded the penetration of mobile phones across India, increasingly being used by adolescent girls. Health interventions are also moving onto digital platforms. Evidence has shown that applications of game elements and game-based learning can be powerful tools in behavior change and health interventions. This provides a unique opportunity, particularly for the private sector, to reach and empower adolescent girls directly with information, products, and services in a private and fun manner. Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe how a design-led Theory of Change (ToC) was formulated for a mobile game app that is not only underpinned by theories of various behavior change models but also identifies variables and triggers for in-game behavioral intentions that can be tracked and measured within the game and validated through a rigorous post-gameplay outcome evaluation. Methods: We describe the use of a multimix methodology to formulate a ToC informing behavioral frameworks and co-design approaches in our proof-of-concept product development journey. This process created a statement of hypothesis and “pathways to impact” with a continuous, cumulative, and iterative design process that included key stakeholders in the production of a smartphone app. With theoretical underpinnings of social behavior and modeling frameworks, systematic research, and other creative methods, we developed a design-led ToC pathway that can delineate complex and multidisciplinary outputs for measuring impact. Results: The statement of hypothesis that emerged posits that “If girls virtually experience the outcomes of choices that they make for their avatar in the mobile game, then they can make informed decisions that direct the course of their own life.” Four learning pathways (DISCOVER, PLAY, DECIDE, and ACT) are scaffolded on 3 pillars of evidence, engagement, and evaluation to support the ToC-led framework. It informs decision-making and life outcomes through game-based objectives and in-game triggers that offer direct access to information, products, and services. Conclusions: This approach of using a multimix methodology for identifying varied and multidisciplinary pathways to change is of particular interest to measuring the impact of innovations, especially digital products, that do not necessarily conform with traditional behavioral change models or standard co-design approaches. We also explain the benefits of using iterative and cumulative inputs to integrate ongoing user feedback, while identifying pathways to various impacts, and not limiting it to only the design and development phase. © Lalita Shankar, Anvita Dixit, Susan Howard.

TI  - A Digital Gaming Intervention to Improve HIV Testing for Adolescents and
Young Adults: Protocol for Development and a Pilot Randomized Controlled
Trial
IS  - 6
VL  - 10
AB  - Background: Two strategies of the US Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative
are early diagnosis of infections via widespread testing and prevention
of new infections using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). These
strategies are particularly important for adolescents and young adults
(AYAs) who are disproportionately affected by HIV, particularly if they
identify as Black and/or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or
questioning, and others (LGBTQ+). This study will develop and test an
interactive life-simulation game in which players can enact real-life
behaviors and receive their HIV risk profile to improve HIV testing and
PrEP access among AYAs aged 13-24 years in Washington, DC.
Objective: This mixed methods study aims to determine the acceptability
of an interactive, enhanced life-simulation game prototype among AYAs,
conduct a pilot test of the gaming intervention among a small cohort of
AYAs to ensure game usability and acceptability, and evaluate the
efficacy of the game in a randomized controlled study with AYAs at risk
for HIV in Washington, DC.
Methods: This research protocol will be conducted in 3 phases. A
formative phase will involve surveys and focus groups (n=64) with AYAs
living in the DC area. These focus groups will allow researchers to
understand youth preferences for game enhancement. The second phase will
consist of a pilot test (n=10) of the gaming intervention. This pilot
test will allow researchers to modify the game based on formative
results and test the planned recruitment and data collection strategy
with intended end users. The third phase will consist of a randomized
controlled study among 300 AYAs to examine the efficacy of the
life-simulation game compared with app-based HIV educational materials
on HIV and PrEP in changing HIV testing, knowledge, risk behaviors, and
PrEP access. Participants will have unlimited access to either the
life-simulation game or the educational app for 3 months from the time
of enrollment. Study assessments will occur at enrollment and at 1, 3,
and 6 months post enrollment via e-surveys. At 6 months, a subset of
intervention participants (n=25) will participate in in-depth exit
interviews regarding their experience being in the study.
Results: Institutional review board approval was received on February 5,
2020. This project is currently recruiting participants for the
formative phase.
Conclusions: This interactive life-simulation intervention aims to
increase HIV testing and PrEP access among AYAs in the DC area. In this
intervention, players can enact real-life behaviors and receive their
HIV risk profile to promote HIV testing and PrEP seeking. Such an
intervention has great potential to improve knowledge of HIV and PrEP
among AYAs, increase motivation and self-efficacy related to HIV testing
and PrEP use, and decrease individual and structural barriers that often
preclude engagement in HIV prevention services.

TI  - Adolescents' and Parents' Perspectives: A Gaming Disorder Intervention in Singapore
IS  - 1
VL  - 70
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to understand useful components and mechanisms in treating adolescent gaming disorder. Background: Although video gaming has become a pervasive part of adolescents' daily life that can lead to educational, physical, psychological, and social problems, there is ongoing debate as to whether this is an addiction, and there is little evidence about treatment effectiveness. Method: This process research used a case study design and conducted individual semistructured interviews with 10 male adolescents and 11 parents after they had completed a treatment program. Results: Four treatment components (individual counseling, family counseling, group mentoring and social support, and alternative activities) were generally found to be useful. Counselors were able to engage the adolescents and serve as role models in gaming through creative use of technology. Conclusion: Practitioners working with adolescents with gaming disorder should attend to their developmental needs pertaining to gaming, health, psychosocial, and educational aspects relevant to the Asian context. Implications: Practitioners should go beyond counseling rooms and adopt different strategies to reach out and work with adolescents who are struggling with excessive gaming in different therapeutic settings via engaging and working with them in individual, family, and group contexts using technology, particularly video games. © 2020 National Council on Family Relations

TI  - Adolescents’ cyber victimization: The influence of technologies, gender, and gender stereotype traits
IS  - 4
VL  - 17
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of gender and gender stereotype traits (masculinity, femininity) in cyber victimization behaviors (cyber relational victimization, cyber verbal victimization, hacking) through different technologies (mobile phones, gaming consoles, social networking sites). There were 456 8th graders (226 females; M age = 13.66, SD = 0.41) from two midwestern middle schools in the United States included in this study. They completed questionnaires on their endorsement of masculine and feminine traits, and self-reported cyber victimization through different technologies. The findings revealed main effects of types of cyber victimization for boys and of technology for girls. In particular, boys with feminine traits experienced the most victimization by cyber verbal aggression, cyber relational aggression, and hacking when compared to the other groups of boys. Girls with feminine traits experienced the most cyber victimization through social networking sites, gaming consoles, and mobile phones in comparison to the other groups of girls. For girls with feminine traits, they reported more cyber relational victimization and cyber verbal victimization through mobile phones and social networking sites, as well as more hacking via social networking sites. Such findings underscore the importance of considering gender stereotype traits, types of victimization, and technologies when examining cyber victimization. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Adolescent sleep misalignment: A chronic jet lag and a matter of public health
IS  - 4
VL  - 107
AB  - Sleep is a key element, both physiologically and psychologically, in adolescent development. The prevalence of sleep disorders in western countries is important, as with age the sleep-wake cycle of adolescents becomes irregular and delayed in relation with later sleep onset and waking time resulting in rhythm desynchronization. A large number of adolescents sleep for 7-8. h instead of 9-10. h per night, which can lead to a cumulative sleep debt with fatigue, behavioral problems and poor academic achievement. The effect of electronic media use (such as television, mobile phone, computer, and electronic gaming) on sleep has been the object of several international studies, though pubertal changes may also impact adolescent sleep. Adolescents and their parents should be educated by professionals, including physicians and nurses, on the key role of sleep in adolescent well being and quality of life. A number of basic rules are proposed to improve sleep in adolescents. The permanent social jet lag experienced by a number of adolescents should be considered as a matter of public health. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Framework of High-Stakes Algorithmic Decision-Making for the Public Sector Developed through a Case Study of Child-Welfare
IS  - CSCW2
VL  - 5
AB  - Algorithms have permeated throughout civil government and society, where they are being used to make high-stakes decisions about human lives. In this paper, we first develop a cohesive framework of algorithmic decision-making adapted for the public sector (ADMAPS) that reflects the complex socio-technical interactions between human discretion, bureaucratic processes, and algorithmic decision-making by synthesizing disparate bodies of work in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Science and Technology Studies (STS), and Public Administration (PA). We then applied the ADMAPS framework to conduct a qualitative analysis of an in-depth, eight-month ethnographic case study of algorithms in daily use within a child-welfare agency that serves approximately 900 families and 1300 children in the mid-western United States. Overall, we found that there is a need to focus on strength-based algorithmic outcomes centered in social ecological frameworks. In addition, algorithmic systems need to support existing bureaucratic processes and augment human discretion, rather than replace it. Finally, collective buy-in in algorithmic systems requires trust in the target outcomes at both the practitioner and bureaucratic levels. As a result of our study, we propose guidelines for the design of high-stakes algorithmic decision-making tools in the child-welfare system, and more generally, in the public sector. We empirically validate the theoretically derived ADMAPS framework to demonstrate how it can be useful for systematically making pragmatic decisions about the design of algorithms for the public sector.

TI  - A gamified mobile-based APP to help university students to manage their tasks
AB  - In our current society, days are full of tasks that must be completed, but time can be seen as insufficient. However, from a gamification point of view, if we could be helped by an APP to remind us not only of doing our daily tasks but to complete them as challenges to get rewards, as a game integrated into our days, we could avoid procrastination and see time as enough if well employed (without distractions as the so-called time thieves). It is our hypothesis that a gamified mobile-based APP integrated into the life of university students could help them to manage their tasks. In this paper, a prototype of Fun Task Manager is presented together with its design process and an evaluation carried out by 90 Primary Education first course university students, who validated the prototype.

TI  - A gamified mobile health intervention for children in day surgery care: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial
IS  - 2
VL  - 9
AB  - Aims: To describe a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial which will evaluate the effectiveness of a gamified mobile health intervention for children in whole day surgery care. Design: A study protocol for a two-arm randomized controlled trial. Methods: Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (N = 62), in which patients receive routine care and play a mobile game designed for children or the control group (N = 62), in which patients receive routine care, including a mobile phone application that supports parents during the care path. The primary outcome is children's pre-operative anxiety, while the secondary outcome measures included fear and postoperative pain, along with parental satisfaction and anxiety. Data collection started in August 2020. Results: The results of the ongoing randomized controlled trial will determine whether the developed gamified mobile health intervention can be recommended for hospital use, and whether it could be used to educate children about their surgical treatment to decrease anxiety. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - A Gamified Smartphone App to Support Engagement in Care and Medication
Adherence for HIV-Positive Young Men Who Have Sex With Men (AllyQuest):
Development and Pilot Study
IS  - 2
VL  - 4
AB  - Background: HIV disproportionately impacts young men who have sex with
men (YMSM) who experience disparities across the HIV care continuum.
Addressing antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among YMSM is an
urgent public health priority. Technology-based
interventions-particularly mobile health platforms-can provide tailored
adherence interventions and allow YMSM to engage and connect with
others.
Objective: The objective of this study was to describe the development
of AllyQuest, a novel, theoretically-based, smartphone app designed to
improve engagement in care and ART adherence and social support among
HIV-positive YMSM.
Methods: AllyQuest was built on an established platform for patient
engagement that embeds social networking and fundamental game mechanics,
such as challenges, points, and rewards. A medication tracker provides
reminders to promote ART adherence via personalized adherence strategies
that are user and context specific; a calendar allows for reflection on
adherence over time. After iterative development with input from two
youth advisory boards, usability testing was conducted to assess app
functionality, comprehension of the educational content, use of
intervention features, and overall impressions of app relevance and
appeal. A 28-day pilot trial was conducted with 20 HIV+ YMSM to evaluate
intervention feasibility and acceptability.
Results: Mean age of participants was 21.8 years (range 19-24), and 95\%
(19/20) of the participants were nonwhite. The mean time of app use was
158.4 min (SD 114.1), with a range of 13 to 441 min. There was a mean of
21.2 days of use (out of a total possible 28 days). There were 222 posts
to the daily discussion social wall. Feasibility and acceptability
ratings were high. Overall, participants found the app easy to use and
navigate, not intrusive, and had few reported technical issues. Higher
levels of app usage were positively correlated with HIV self-management
outcomes, and there was a statistically significant (P<.05) positive
association between the number of days logged into the app and knowledge
and confidence in ability to reliably take HIV medications.
Conclusions: AllyQuest represents a new, highly scalable solution that
is well-suited to meet the specific prevention and care needs of HIV+
YMSM. The development of this intervention is both timely and vital,
given the urgency of the ongoing HIV epidemic among YMSM.

TI  - A Generalised Method for Empirical Game Theoretic Analysis
AB  - This paper provides theoretical bounds for empirical game theoretical analysis of complex multi-agent interactions. We provide insights in the empirical meta game showing that a Nash equilibrium of the meta-game is an approximate Nash equilibrium of the true underlying game. We investigate and show how many data samples are required to obtain a close enough approximation of the underlying game. Additionally, we extend the meta-game analysis methodology to asymmetric games. The state-of-the-art has only considered empirical games in which agents have access to the same strategy sets and the payoff structure is symmetric, implying that agents are interchangeable. Finally, we carry out an empirical illustration of the generalised method in several domains, illustrating the theory and evolutionary dynamics of several versions of the AlphaGo algorithm (symmetric), the dynamics of the Colonel Blotto game played by human players on Facebook (symmetric), and an example of a meta-game in Leduc Poker (asymmetric), generated by the PSRO multi-agent learning algorithm.

TI  - All Tapped Out: Touchscreen Interactivity and Young Children's Word
Learning
VL  - 8
AB  - Touchscreen devices differ from passive screen media in promoting
physical interaction with events on the screen. Two studies examined how
young children's screen-directed actions related to self-regulation
(Study 1) and word learning (Study 2). In Study 1, 30 2-year-old
children's tapping behaviors during game play were related to their
self-regulation, measured using Carlson's snack task: girls and children
with high self-regulation tapped significantly less during instruction
portions of an app (including object labeling events) than did boys and
children with low self-regulation. Older preschoolers (N = 47, aged 4-6
years) tapped significantly less during instruction than 2-year-olds
did. Study 2 explored whether the particular way in which 170 children
(2-4 years of age) interacted with a touchscreen app affected their
learning of novel object labels. Conditions in which children tapped or
dragged a named object to move it across the screen required different
amounts of effort and focus, compared to a non-interactive (watching)
condition. Age by sex interactions revealed a particular benefit of
dragging (a motorically challenging behavior) for preschool girls'
learning compared to that of boys, especially for girls older than age
2. Boys benefited more from watching than dragging. Children from low
socioeconomic status families learned more object names when dragging
objects versus tapping them, possibly because tapping is a prepotent
response that does not require thoughtful attention. Parents and
industry experts should consider age, sex, self-regulation, and the
physical requirements of children's engagement with touchscreens when
designing and using educational content.

TI  - A mobile gaming intervention to increase adherence to antiretroviral treatment for youth living with hiv: Development guided by the information, motivation, and behavioral skills model
IS  - 4
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: Highly active combination antiretroviral treatment has been shown to markedly improve the health of HIV-infected adolescents and young adults. Adherence to antiretroviral treatment leads to decreased morbidity and mortality and decreases the number of hospitalizations. However, these clinical achievements can only occur when young persons with HIV are adherent to care. Unfortunately, adolescents and young adults have poorer rates of adherence to antiretroviral medications and poorer rates of retention in care than older adults. Novel and engaging digital approaches are needed to help adolescents and young adults living with HIV be adherent to treatment. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop an immersive, action-oriented iPhone gaming intervention to improve adherence to antiretroviral medication and treatment. Methods: Game development was guided by social learning theory, taking into consideration the perspectives of adolescents and young adults living with HIV. A total of 20 adolescents and young adults were recruited from an HIV care clinic in Rhode Island, and they participated in qualitative interviews guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills model of behavior change. The mean age of participants was 22 years, 60% (12/20) of the participants identified as male, and 60% (12/20) of the sample reported missing a dose of antiretroviral medication in the previous week. Acceptability of the game was assessed with client service questionnaire and session evaluation form. Results: A number of themes emerged that informed game development. Adolescents and young adults living with HIV desired informational game content that included new and comprehensive details about HIV, details about HIV as it relates to doctors’ visits, and general health information. Motivational themes that emerged were the desire for enhancement of future orientation; reinforcement of positive influences from partners, parents, and friends; collaboration with health care providers; decreasing stigma; and increasing personal relevance of HIV care. Behavioral skills themes centered on self-efficacy and strategies for medical adherence and self-care. On the client service questionnaire, 10 out of the 11 participants indicated they were “satisfied with the game activities,” and 9 out of 11 “would recommend it to a friend.” On the session evaluation form, 9 out of 11 agreed that they “learned a lot from the game.” Conclusions: We utilized youth feedback, social learning theory (information-motivation-behavioral skills), and agile software development to create a multilevel, immersive, action-oriented iPhone gaming intervention to measure and improve treatment adherence for adolescents and young adults living with HIV. There is a dearth of gaming interventions for this population, and this study is a significant step in working toward the development and testing of an iPhone gaming app intervention to promote adherence to antiretroviral treatment. © Laura Whiteley, Larry Brown, Michelle Lally, Nicholas Heck, Jacob J van den Berg.

TI  - A multimodal analysis combining behavioral experiments and survey-based methods to assess the cognitive effect of video game playing: Good or evil?
IS  - 11
VL  - 20
AB  - This study aims to bridge the gap between the discrepant views of existing studies in different modalities on the cognitive effect of video game play. To this end, we conducted a set of tests with different modalities within each participant: (1) Self-Reports Analyses (SRA) consisting of five popular self-report surveys, and (2) a standard Behavioral Experiment (BE) using pro- and antisaccade paradigms, and analyzed how their results vary between Video Game Player (VGP) and Non-Video Game Player (NVGP) participant groups. Our result showed that (1) VGP scored significantly lower in Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) than NVGP (p = 0.023), and (2) VGP showed significantly higher antisaccade error rate than NVGP (p = 0.005), suggesting that results of both SRA and BE support the existing view that video game play has a maleficent impact on the cognition by increasing impulsivity. However, the following correlation analysis on the results across individual participants found no significant correlation between SRA and BE, indicating a complex nature of the cognitive effect of video game play. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - A Narrative Review of Social Media and Game-Based Nutrition Interventions Targeted at Young Adults
IS  - 5
VL  - 117
AB  - The increased popularity of social media and mobile gaming among young adults provides an opportunity for innovative nutrition programs. This review evaluated the efficacy of these strategies in interventions targeted at 18- to 35-year-olds. The protocol was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Ten scientific databases, information technology conference proceedings, and gray literature were searched. Two reviewers conducted screening, data extraction, and quality assessments. Interventions were included if they used social media or electronic games. Comparisons were made pre- to post-intervention, or between intervention and control arms. Outcomes of interest included change in nutrition knowledge, attitudes, behavior, or weight and/or body composition. Eleven social media−based (randomized controlled trials [RCT] n=7) and six game-based [RCT n=1]) interventions were included. Overall quality of studies was low. Social media−based strategies included forum/blogs (n=5), Facebook (n=5), Twitter (n=1), YouTube (n=1), and chat rooms (n=1). Eight (RCT n=6) of 11 social media−based studies demonstrated improvements in outcomes. Findings suggested that social media may be more effective when combined with other strategies. Virtual reality games (n=3), web-based games (n=2), and a mobile application (n=1) were used in the gaming interventions. While a significant increase in knowledge was reported by three gaming studies (RCT=1), two used nonvalidated tools and longer-term measures of weight and behavioral outcomes were limited. The use of social media and gaming for nutrition promotion is in its infancy. Preliminary evidence suggests that these strategies have some utility for intervening with young adults. Further research using high-quality study designs is required, with measurement of outcomes over longer time periods.

TI  - A Naturalistic Study of Child and Family Screen Media and Mobile Device Use
IS  - 2
VL  - 28
AB  - Parental mediation of screen media (e.g., television, video games) is associated with better outcomes for children. Although much research has examined parental mediation of television (TV), there is a dearth of research examining communication about mobile media (e.g., Smartphones, tablets) in the digital age. This study seeks to identify themes of family communication around media and mobile devices using naturalistic observational methodology. The sample consisted of 21 toddlers (ages 12–24-months old), 31 preschool-age children (3–5 years old), and 23 school-age (10–13 years old) children and their families. Children wore Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) audio recording devices, which recorded vocalizations and other sounds proximal to the child wearing the device in the home environment, as well as audible screen media use. ATLAS.ti was used to transcribe dialogue from the audio recordings that pertained to screen media. Experts from the fields of communication, clinical child psychology, and developmental-behavioral pediatrics independently analyzed the transcripts to identify common themes. Five main themes emerged. First, parental mediation of screen media was primarily restrictive, reactive, and focused on technology functionality. Second, active mediation was child-driven. Third, siblings played a more dominant role in mediation than parents. Fourth, parents and children negotiated screen time limits. Finally, parallel family media use was common. Multiple family members engaged with their own mobile devices while simultaneously being exposed to background screen media (i.e., media multitasking). Assessing media use in the naturalistic home environment elucidated current patterns of family media use and communication about media in the digital age. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - An augmented reality learning toolkit for fostering spatial ability in mathematics lesson: Design and development
IS  - 4
VL  - 9
AB  - Previous research claimed that integration of augmented reality on educational settings helps to improve academic achievement of students in collaborative learning environments, as well as to improve their retention and ability to translate this within other environments. Since augmented reality is still considered relatively novel technology in educational fields, there is an inherent need for research-based guides to design effective and feasible augmented reality tools for school-based learning. The main aim of this study was therefore to design and develop an augmented reality learning toolkit to foster spatial ability in middle school students using mobile devices. The study was conducted in two parts, as preliminary research and a prototyping phase. The findings guided the characteristics for designing an augmented reality learning toolkit with a set of spatial tasks aimed at middle school students. In light of the results, it can be inferred that the students were able to use this designed toolkit to perform their spatial ability through given spatial tasks since the students encountered no technical difficulties with the final toolkit prototype, and that they were able to use the toolkit assuredly. In conclusion, the study showed that augmented reality seemed helpful in enhancing the usage of mobile devices, not just for the reading of books, communication or playing games, but also as a support mechanism for the learning of mathematics. Thus, the augmented reality toolkit developed in this study presents a new way for students and/or teachers to use mobile devices in the learning and teaching of mathematics. © 2021, Bastas.

TI  - An Educational Digital Game Driven Strategy to Support the Teaching-Learning of Algorithms and Motivate Female Information Systems Students
AB  - Context: Research has highlighted the various benefits to a project or product when gender diversity is present in information technology teams, yet women are underrepresented in the area. Problem: Although women constitute the majority of students enrolled in undergraduate courses, there is a noticeable gender disparity in technology. Solution: Acquiring proficiency in fundamental subjects, such as algorithms, can motivate women entering the Information Systems course to persevere and overcome barriers. Games, as an important ally in the teaching-learning process, can help in this context. Is Theory: This work was conceived under the aegis of cyberfeminism, which defends the use by women of new information and communication technologies for empowerment and increasing female representation. Method A questionnaire was administered to female students to identify relevant characteristics for defining a digital game. After that, a digital game was designed by female students based on the responses and focusing on their reality at the beginning of the course at the university. A heuristic and feedback evaluation were carried out to evaluate the first version of the developed game. Summary of Results: According to the evaluations presented in this work, the content covered is relevant to the game’s theme, and the examples help apply the concepts of Algorithms in a motivating way for female students in the Information Systems course. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: A game developed by women with relatable characters can encourage the entry and permanence of women in Information Systems courses and related areas.

TI  - An evaluation of The Great Escape: Can an interactive computer game improve young children's Fire safety knowledge and behaviors?
IS  - 4
VL  - 31
AB  - Objective: Fire is a leading cause of unintentional injury and, although young children are at particularly increased risk, there are very few evidence-based resources available to teach them fire safety knowledge and behaviors. Using a pre-post randomized design, the current study evaluated the effectiveness of a computer game (The Great Escape) for teaching fire safety information to young children (3.5-6 years). Method: Using behavioral enactment procedures, children's knowledge and behaviors related to fire safety were compared to a control group of children before and after receiving the intervention. Results: The results indicated significant improvements in knowledge and fire safety behaviors in the intervention group but not the control. Conclusion: Using computer games can be an effective way to promote young children's understanding of safety and how to react in different hazardous situations. © 2012 American Psychological Association.

TI  - An evaluation of the Hear Glue Ear mobile application for children aged 2–8 years old with otitis media with effusion
VL  - 6
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the acceptability and usability of the Hear Glue Ear mobile application to guide families and support speech and language development in children with otitis media with effusion (OME). To assess the validity of the app’s game-based hearing test to estimate changes in hearing levels between audiology appointments. Method: This evaluation examined 60 children aged 2–8 with and without OME, attending Cambridge Community Audiology clinics. Children’s performance in the app’s hearing test was compared to their pure tone average (PTA) obtained in clinic. Children and caregivers completed questionnaires after their first interaction with the app, and after one week of using it at home. 18 clinicians completed anonymous questionnaires after trialling the app. Results: Results from the app’s hearing test show a significant correlation with clinic PTA values ((Formula presented.)). 73.1% of caregivers supported their child using the app regularly and 85% thought it enabled them to give more accurate reports to clinicians. After one week, 87.0% of families downloaded and used the app at home, and 85.7% of these felt it provided strategies to help their child. 100% of children liked the app and 93.3% found it easy to use. 77.8% of clinicians supported patients using the app regularly. Conclusions: Hear Glue Ear is acceptable to children, caregivers and clinicians as part of OME management. The app’s hearing test provides a valid estimate of fluctuating hearing levels. Hear Glue Ear is a free, accessible and family-centred intervention to provide trusted information and support development, as NICE guidance recommends. © The Author(s) 2020.

TI  - An Evidence-Based Serious Game App for Public Education on Antibiotic Use and Antimicrobial Resistance: Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: The misuse and overuse of antibiotics contribute to the acceleration of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), but public knowledge on appropriate antibiotic use and AMR remained low despite ongoing health promotion efforts. App gamification has gained traction in recent years for health promotion and to affect change in health behaviors. Hence, we developed an evidence-based serious game app “SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence” to educate the public on appropriate antibiotic use and AMR and address knowledge gaps. Objective: We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the “SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence” app in improving the knowledge of, attitude toward, and perception (KAP) of appropriate antibiotic use and AMR among the public. The primary objective is to assess the changes in KAP of antibiotic use and AMR in our participants, while the secondary objectives are to assess the extent of user engagement with the app and the level of user satisfaction in using the app. Methods: Our study is a parallel 2-armed randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation. We plan to recruit 400 participants (patients or their caregivers) aged 18-65 years from government-funded primary care clinics in Singapore. Participants are randomized in blocks of 4 and into the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group are required to download the “SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence” app on their smartphones and complete a game quest within 2 weeks. Users will learn about appropriate antibiotic use and effective methods to recover from uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections by interacting with the nonplayer characters and playing 3 minigames in the app. The control group will not receive any intervention. Results: The primary study outcome is the change in participants’ KAP toward antibiotic use and AMR 6-10 weeks post intervention or 6-10 weeks from baseline for the control group (web-based survey). We will also assess the knowledge level of participants immediately after the participant completes the game quest (in the app). The secondary study outcomes are the user engagement level (tracked by the app) and satisfaction level of playing the game (via the immediate postgame survey). The satisfaction survey will also collect participants’ feedback on the game app. Conclusions: Our proposed study provides a unique opportunity to assess the effectiveness of a serious game app in public health education. We anticipate possible ceiling effects and selection bias in our study and have planned to perform subgroup analyses to adjust for confounding factors. The app intervention will benefit a larger population if it is proven to be effective and acceptable to users. © Zhilian Huang, Wern Ee Tang, Huiling Guo, Karthiga Natarajan, Tau Hong Lee, Tsin Wen Yeo, Angela Chow.

TI  - An examination of interactions in a three-dimensional virtual world
VL  - 88
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds hold the users' attention by
providing rich interaction in an environment similar to the real world.
User engagement duration is known to increase in environments with
intense interaction. However, information in the literature about
whether gender, experience, or spatial ability affects interaction in
these environments is limited. In this study, these three factors are
compared to users' depth of interaction in a 3D virtual world. In
addition, the relationships between engagement duration, spatial
ability, and depth of interaction are examined to investigate whether
the first two factors can predict the third. Findings showed that users'
depth of interaction was not influenced by gender, but experience and
spatial ability did affect interaction. A strong relationship was
determined between depth of interaction and engagement duration, and a
moderate relationship was found between depth of interaction and spatial
ability. Findings indicated that when designing 3D environments, it is
important to consider which kinds of tasks provide more interaction and
to what extent spatial abilities affect interaction, as well as to
prepare activities that will increase engagement duration and to devise
strategies to enhance depth of interaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI  - An exploratory study of HIV prevention with Mexican/Latino migrant day laborers
IS  - 2
VL  - 5
AB  - The purpose of this exploratory study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot HIV prevention intervention with one of the most mobile of U.S.-Mexico transborder populations: Mexican/Latino migrant day laborers (MDLs). Intervention development was informed by preliminary research that included an HIV risk survey of over a hundred MDLs, and a focus group to explore the topic of HIV in the lives of MDLs. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to evaluate the intervention, and to identify some of the contextual characteristics of HIV risk factors in the MDL experience. For example, the most frequent theme revealed by qualitative analysis was the stressful and vulnerable state of desesperación [desperation], resulting from earning too littlemoney, that participants linked to deviating from their migration goals and succumbing to alcohol and drug use, and risky sex. While empirical results are limited by the small sample of convenience (N = 23), lack of a control group, and loss of about half of the sample by one month follow-up evaluation, findings were encouragingly consistent with intervention goals: Post-intervention data revealed what appear to be substantial gains in carrying condoms (e.g., from 43% to 83%) as well as in knowledge of proper condom use. Further, frequency of sex with risky sex partners decreased in general, while condom use was reported for all sexual encounters assessed during post-evaluation. The theoretical framework used to guide the intervention, a hybrid of the Health Belief Model and Friere's model of participatory education, included visual triggers composed of customized Mexican lottery game cards to elicit discussion of HIV risk and prevention in the MDL experience. © 2006 The Haworth Press, Inc.

TI  - An interactive game-based shoulder wheel system for rehabilitation
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: Increases in the aging population and in the number of accidents have resulted in more people suffering from physical impairments or disabilities. Rehabilitation therapy thus attracts greater attention as a means of helping patients recover and return to a normal life. With the extremely long and tedious nature of traditional rehabilitation, patients are reluctant to continue the entire process, thus the expected effects of the therapy cannot be obtained. Games are well known to help patients improve their concentration and shift their attention away from the discomfort of their injuries during rehabilitation. Thus, incorporating game technology into a rehabilitation program may be a promising approach. Methods: In this study, a gaming system used for shoulder rehabilitation was developed. The mechanical parts and electric circuits were integrated to mimic the functionalities of a shoulder wheel. Several games were also designed to suit the rehabilitation needs of the patients based on the age and gender differences among the individual users, enabling individuals to undergo the rehabilitation process by playing games. Two surveys were conducted to evaluate the satisfaction of the participants regarding the gaming system. Results: The results of the online survey among a larger population coincide with the responses of the hands-on participants through a paper-and-pencil survey. Statistical results suggest that the participants are willing to accept this novel approach. Conclusion: This gaming system can distract a patient from the sensation of pain or anxiety, and increase their motivation to participate in the therapeutic program. Advantages in terms of low-cost and easy setup increase the attractiveness of this new equipment for various potential users. © 2012 Chang et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

TI  - An interactive home-based cognitive-motor step training program to reduce fall risk in older adults: Qualitative descriptive study of older adults' experiences and requirements
IS  - 2
VL  - 1
AB  - Background: Falls are a major contributor to the burden of disease in older adults. Home-based exercise programs are effective in reducing the rate and risk of falls in older adults. However, adherence to home-based exercise programs is low, limiting the efficacy of interventions. The implementation of technology-based exercise programs for older adults to use at home may increase exercise adherence and, thus, the effectiveness of fall prevention interventions. More information about older adults' experiences when using technologies at home is needed to enable the design of programs that are tailored to older adults' needs. Objective: This study aimed to (1) explore older adults' experiences using SureStep, an interactive cognitive-motor step training program to reduce fall risk unsupervised at home; (2) explore program features that older adults found encouraged program uptake and adherence; (3) identify usability issues encountered by older adults when using the program; and (4) provide guidance for the design of a future technology-based exercise program tailored to older adults to use at home as a fall prevention strategy. Methods: This study was part of a larger randomized controlled trial. The qualitative portion of the study and the focus of this paper used a qualitative descriptive design. Data collectors conducted structured, open-ended in-person interviews with study participants who were randomly allocated to use SureStep at home for 4 months. All interviews were audiotaped and ranged from 45 to 60 min. Thematic analysis was used to analyze collected data. This study was guided by Pender's Health Promotion Model. Results: Overall, 24 older adults aged 70 to 97 years were interviewed. Findings suggest older adults are open to use technology-based exercise programs at home, and in the context of optimizing adherence to home-based exercise programs for the prevention of falls, findings suggest that program developers should develop exercise programs in ways that provide older adults with a fun and enjoyable experience (thus increasing intrinsic motivation to exercise), focus on improving outcomes that are significant to older adults (thus increasing self-determined extrinsic motivation), offer challenging yet attainable exercises (thus increasing perceived self-competence), provide positive feedback on performance (thus increasing self-efficacy), and are easy to use (thus reducing perceived barriers to technology use). Conclusions: This study provides important considerations when designing technology-based programs so they are tailored to the needs of older adults, increasing both usability and acceptability of programs and potentially enhancing exercise participation and long-term adherence to fall prevention interventions. Program uptake and adherence seem to be influenced by (1) older adults' perceived benefits of undertaking the program, (2) whether the program is stimulating, and (3) the perceived barriers to exercise and technology use. Older adults shared important recommendations for future development of technologies for older adults to use at home. © 2020 JMIR Publications. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Novel Approach for Engagement in Team Training in High-Technology Surgery: The Robotic-Assisted Surgery Olympics
IS  - 6
VL  - 18
AB  - Introduction There is ongoing interest in the development of technical and nontechnical skills in healthcare to improve safety and efficiency; however, barriers to developing and delivering related training programs make them difficult to implement. Unique approaches to training such as "serious games"may offer ways to motivate teams, reinforce skill acquisition, and promote teamwork. Given increased challenges to teamwork in robotic-assisted surgery (RAS), researchers aimed to develop the "RAS Olympics,"a game-based educational competition to improve skills needed to successfully perform RAS. Methods This pilot study was conducted at an academic medical center in Southern California. Robotic-assisted surgery staff were invited to participate in the "RAS Olympics"to develop their skills and identify opportunities to improve processes. Impact of the activity was assessed using surveys and debriefs. Results Sixteen operating room team members participated and reacted favorably toward the RAS-Olympics (average score, 4.5/5). They enjoyed the activity, would recommend all staff participate, felt that it was relevant to their work, and believed that they practiced and learned new techniques that would improve their practice. Confidence in skills remained unchanged. Participants preferred the RAS Olympics to traditional training because it provided an interactive learning environment. Conclusions The successful implementation of the RAS Olympics provided insight into new opportunities to engage surgical staff members while also training technical and nontechnical skills. Furthermore, this shared experience allowed surgical staff members to gain a greater appreciation for their teammates and an understanding of the current challenges and methods to improve teamwork and communication while promoting safety and efficiency in RAS.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

TI  - Antagonistic Coevolution Drives Whack-a-Mole Sensitivity in Gene Regulatory Networks
IS  - 10
VL  - 11
AB  - Robustness, defined as tolerance to perturbations such as mutations and environmental fluctuations, is pervasive in biological systems. However, robustness often coexists with its counterpart, evolvability—the ability of perturbations to generate new phenotypes. Previous models of gene regulatory network evolution have shown that robustness evolves under stabilizing selection, but it is unclear how robustness and evolvability will emerge in common coevolutionary scenarios. We consider a two-species model of coevolution involving one host and one parasite population. By using two interacting species, key model parameters that determine the fitness landscapes become emergent properties of the model, avoiding the need to impose these parameters externally. In our study, parasites are modeled on species such as cuckoos where mimicry of the host phenotype confers high fitness to the parasite but lower fitness to the host. Here, frequent phenotype changes are favored as each population continually adapts to the other population. Sensitivity evolves at the network level such that point mutations can induce large phenotype changes. Crucially, the sensitive points of the network are broadly distributed throughout the network and continually relocate. Each time sensitive points in the network are mutated, new ones appear to take their place. We have therefore named this phenomenon “whack-a-mole” sensitivity, after a popular fun park game. We predict that this type of sensitivity will evolve under conditions of strong directional selection, an observation that helps interpret existing experimental evidence, for example, during the emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance. © 2015 Shin, MacCarthy.

TI  - A participatory approach to iteratively adapting game design workshops to empower autistic youth
VL  - 8
AB  - Introduction: Autistic people face systemic barriers to fair employment. Informal learning may promote the self-determination transition-age autistic youth need to overcome and/or transform these barriers. This report focuses on the iterative process of developing video game design workshops guided by feedback from autistic students about instructional strategies they found engaging. This study is part of a three-year-long NSF-funded program of research that seeks to empower autistic youth to move toward successful careers by teaching educators how to more effectively guide them. Methods: In the Summer of 2021, educators at an award-winning NYC-based, not-for-profit, education program, Tech Kids Unlimited (TKU) collaborated with researchers, including autistic students, to iteratively develop and assess two online game design workshops for transition-age autistic youth. Participants selected which workshop they were available for (Workshop 1: n = 18; M age = 16.72 years; Workshop 2: n = 16; M age = 16.56 years). Students in Workshop 2 had more varied support needs and were less motivated to learn video game design than students in Workshop 1. Students completed assessments before and after each workshop and rated their interest in specific workshop activities after each activity. Guided by data from Workshop 1, we revised instructional strategies before conducting Workshop 2. Results: We found little evidence for our hypothesis that attentional style would impact educational engagement. However, video game design self-efficacy and self-determination were often positively associated with engagement. Two industry speakers, one of whom was autistic, were among the highest-rated activities. As hypothesized, video game design self-efficacy and self-determination (and unexpectedly) spatial planning improved from pre- to post-test following Workshop 1. Despite our efforts to use what we learned in Workshop 1 to improve in Workshop 2, Workshop 2 did not lead to significant improvements in outcomes. However, students highlighted instructional strategies as a strength of Workshop 2 more often than they had for Workshop 1. Educators highlighted the importance of group “temperature checks,” individualized check-ins, social–emotional support for students and educators, and fostering a positive atmosphere. Discussion: Findings suggest that interactive multimodal activities, stimulating discussions, and opportunities to engage with neurodivergent industry professionals may engage and empower diverse autistic youth.

TI  - A point system to predict the future risk of obesity in 10-year-old
children
VL  - 28
AB  - Background: A 4-year longitudinal study was conducted to develop a model
and a point system for predicting childhood obesity.Methods: This study
included 1,504 Japanese 10-year-old children who underwent health
check-ups between 2011 and 2015. Multivariable logistic regression
analysis was conducted using the explanatory variables overweight and
lifestyle. Obesity was defined as percentage overweight (POW) > 20\%
calculated by the following equation: (actual weight symbolscript
standard weight by height and sex)/ standard weight by height and sex
symbolscript 100 (\%). The model was validated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow
test on 10-year-olds.Results: Our prediction model for development of
childhood obesity was based on seven binary variables: sex, lack of
sleep, >2-h use of television/ games/ smartphone, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, hepatic dysfunction, and being overweight. The area under
the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.803 (95\%
confidence interval, 0.740 to 0.866). When validated in non-obese
children (n = 415), there was no significant difference between actual
and predicted numbers of children with obesity (Hosmer-Lemeshow
chi-square = 7.90, symbolscript = 0.18).Conclusion: The validated
prediction model and point score for obesity development were shown to
be useful tools for predicting the future 4-year risk of developing
obesity among 10 years-old children. The point system may be useful for
reducing the occurrence of childhood obesity and promoting better
health.

TI  - Applying Digital Technologies to Tackle Teen Dating Violence: a Systematic Review; [Tecnologias digitais utilizadas no combate à violência no namoro entre adolescentes: uma revisão sistemática]; [Tecnologías digitales aplicadas para combatir la violencia en el noviazgo entre adolescentes: una revisión sistemática]
AB  - The aim of this study was to understand how digital technologies are being used to tackle dating violence among teenagers. A systematic review of national and international scientific literature was carried out in the Web of Science, PsycInfo, Pubmed, DOAJ, SciELO, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, in November and December 2019. Eleven studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review; only one study had been carried out in Brazil, suggesting a gap in national scientific production on the subject. It was found that digital technologies have been successfully applied in the prevention of, and intervention in, situations of dating violence. There was a range of tools available for tackling this phenomenon among teenagers, including: smartphone apps, text messaging, digital games, and online multimedia. It is recommended that actions to tackle dating violence take account of the various expressions of violence — physical, psychological, sexual, and, more recently, digital — and their far-reaching repercussions for physical and mental health. © 2022, Associação Brasileira de Psicologia.

TI  - Applying Qualitative Data Derived from a Rapid Assessment and Response (RAR) Approach to Develop a Community-based HIV Prevention Program for Adolescents in Thailand
IS  - 5
VL  - 26
AB  - HIV education programs are needed to address risk-taking behavior for adolescents. The purpose of our study was to use the World Health Organization's Rapid Assessment and Response (RAR) method to design a community-based, cultural- and age-appropriate HIV prevention program for adolescents in Bangkok, Thailand. Adolescent single-gender-specific focus groups (n = 3; 28 participants) were used to gather reactions/ideas about program topics/approaches. An adult, mixed-gender group was held to review information identified by adolescents. Sessions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Themes regarding HIV content and the process of implementation emerged from a qualitative content analysis of the data. Community representatives recommended incorporation of HIV information and risk-prevention skills. Information delivery suggestions included small group discussions, interactive games/role-playing, program materials/terminology, and HIV-infected program facilitators. Community members provided critical input toward an HIV prevention program tailored to meet adolescents' unique needs/interests. The RAR model provides opportunities to engage communities in developing health-related interventions. © 2015 Association of Nurses in AIDS Care.

TI  - A professional development model to facilitate teacher adoption of interactive, immersive digital games for classroom learning
IS  - 1
VL  - 50
AB  - The benefits of using digital games in the curriculum are well documented in literature. Most teachers who use digital games use short-form drill-and-practice learning games rather than the kinds of games most students would choose to play in their free time. The use of more interactive, immersive digital games (IDGs) in classrooms tends to be sporadic, dependent upon the enthusiasm and ingenuity of individual teachers. Previous studies have indicated that many teachers have concerns about using digital games in classrooms and have difficulties knowing how to best use digital games. This qualitative study presents a professional development model for teachers that was inductively derived through analysing in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 13 educators who have used digital games in the classroom. Implementing this model can help teachers develop attitudes and skills necessary to meaningfully use interactive, IDGs in their classrooms. Evidence suggests that a mentor should have a strong understanding of how to use digital games effectively in classrooms, work with small cohorts of teachers to collegially plan the use of digital games within a unit of class work, trial the unit of work with a small number of enthusiastic teachers, and then implement it with the remaining teachers. This approach is based on interviews with educators who have successfully mentored teachers in their schools to use interactive, IDGs in their classrooms. These educators encountered little resistance from their teaching colleagues. Their approach further supported teachers who were open to the possibilities of using digital games in their classrooms. © 2018 British Educational Research Association

TI  - A protocol for a randomized clinical trial of interactive video dance: Potential for effects on cognitive function
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: Physical exercise has the potential to affect cognitive function, but most evidence to date focuses on cognitive effects of fitness training. Cognitive exercise also may influence cognitive function, but many cognitive training paradigms have failed to provide carry-over to daily cognitive function. Video games provide a broader, more contextual approach to cognitive training that may induce cognitive gains and have carry over to daily function. Most video games do not involve physical exercise, but some novel forms of interactive video games combine physical activity and cognitive challenge. Methods/Design: This paper describes a randomized clinical trial in 168 postmenopausal sedentary overweight women that compares an interactive video dance game with brisk walking and delayed entry controls. The primary endpoint is adherence to activity at six months. Additional endpoints include aspects of physical and mental health. We focus this report primarily on the rationale and plans for assessment of multiple cognitive functions. Discussion: This randomized clinical trial may provide new information about the cognitive effects of interactive videodance. It is also the first trial to examine physical and cognitive effects in older women. Interactive video games may offer novel strategies to promote physical activity and health across the life span. The study is IRB approved and the number is: PRO08080012 ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01443455. © 2012 Jovancevic- Misic et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - A Public Health Communication Intervention Using Edutainment and
Communication Technology to Promote Safer Sex among Heterosexual Men
Patronizing Entertainment Establishments
IS  - 1
VL  - 24
AB  - It is a challenge to reach out, develop and implement a communication
intervention for heterosexual men (HSM) patronizing entertainment
establishments (EEs) to promote safer sex. We described the theoretical
basis and process from assessment to implementation where edutainment
(talk shows) and communication technology (interactive web portal) was
implemented. A female comedian hosted the talk shows. The portal
contained an HIV risk profile calculator with individually tailored
strategies to lower risk; two videos on real-life stories of unsafe sex
and exit strategies to avoid casual or paid sex; as well as online
support. We integrated edutainment, social cognitive theory (SCT) and
the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). Edutainment techniques like
humor through jokes, fun through games, and narrative persuasion through
real-life accounts were applied. The SCT focused on modifying attitudes
and social norm on sexual well-being, increasing self-perceived HIV/STI
risk as well as building self-efficacy and skills in condom use. We
applied the ELM to guide communication strategies and message
development. For peripheral processing, we used cues like comedian
delivery and charisma. For central processing, we focused on argument
framing, issue involvement, argument quality, and modeling. The
intervention was effective in promoting condom use with casual partners
among the target group in Singapore.

TI  - A randomized controlled efficacy trial of an mHealth HIV prevention
intervention for sexual minority young men: MyPEEPS mobile study
protocol
IS  - 1
VL  - 20
AB  - Background Young sexual minority men in the United States have a high
incidence rate of HIV infection. Early intervention among this group,
that is timed to precede or coincide with sexual initiation, is of
critical importance to prevent HIV infection. Despite this, there are
very few published randomized controlled efficacy trials testing
interventions to reduce sexual vulnerability for HIV acquisition among
racially/ethnically diverse, very young, sexual minority men (aged <= 18
years). This paper describes the design of a mobile app-based
intervention trial to reduce sexual risk for HIV acquisition and promote
health protection in this group. Methods This study is a randomized
controlled trial of an mHealth-based HIV prevention intervention,
MyPEEPS Mobile, among diverse sexual minority cisgender young men, aged
13-18 years. The mobile intervention was adapted from a prior
group-based intervention curriculum with evidence of efficacy, designed
to be specific to the risk contexts and realities of young sexual
minority men, and to include psychoeducational and skill-building
components with interactive games and activities. Participants are
recruited locally within four regional hubs (Birmingham, AL, Chicago,
IL, New York City, NY, Seattle, WA) and nationwide via the Internet,
enrolled in-person or remotely (via videoconference), and randomized
(1:1) to either the MyPEEPS Mobile intervention or delayed intervention
condition. Post-hoc stratification by age, race/ethnicity, and
urban/suburban vs. rural statuses is used to ensure diversity in the
sample. The primary outcomes are number of male anal sex partners and
frequency of sexual acts with male partners (with and without condoms),
sex under the influence of substances, and uptake of pre-and
post-exposure prophylaxis, as well as testing for HIV and other sexually
transmitted infections at 3-, 6- and 9-month follow-up. Discussion
Behavioral interventions for very young sexual minority men are needed
to prevent sexual risk early in their sexual development and maturation.
This study will provide evidence to determine feasibility and efficacy
of a mobile app-based HIV prevention intervention to reduce sexual risk
among this very young group.

TI  - Arbi Care application increases preschool children's hand-washing self-efficacy among preschool children
VL  - 28
AB  - Objective: This research aimed to examine the effectiveness of an Android mobile game application called Arbi Care as a means to prevent diarrhea and build self-efficacy in hand washing among preschool children. Method: This research used a pre- and post-test control group and time series design approach. Respondents were chosen randomly from a group of four to six years children. The intervention group (n = 60) received Arbi Care intervention for 25 minutes, twice a week, for five weeks while the control group (n = 60) received standard education. Self-efficacy was measured by using questionnaire and observation. Measurement was carried out three times in the sixth, eight, and tenth week post-intervention. The data was analyzed using the GLMRM test. Results: There was a significant increase in the average score of self-efficacy in hand washing for the intervention group versus the control group. Moreover, there were significant differences in the results of average scores in which the intervention group showed much better self-efficacy improvement over the control group during the first, second, and final post-test after the intervention was given (p < 0.001). Conclusions: An Android-based educational game can be an effective medium to improve hand washing self-efficacy among preschool children, thus helping to prevent diarrhea. © 2018 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

TI  - A Sense of Belonging: Pokémon GO and Social Connectedness
IS  - 6
VL  - 14
AB  - The free-to-play mobile game Pokémon GO’s (PGO) use of real-world mapping encourages play in public spaces, opening up the possibility of greater engagement with other players, local communities, and surrounds. This study conducted a series of interviews (N = 15) and collected online social forum reports of gameplay (N = 880), in order to determine what the social outcomes of play may be and what mechanisms might be facilitating the social connectedness. Thematic analysis revealed that playing PGO produced a sense of belonging, linked to a sense of place, as well as facilitating conversations with strangers and strengthening social ties. This was due to the use of accessible technology able to be integrated into daily routines, shared passion for the game, and mechanics that encouraged players out of their homes. “Shared passion” was tied to the nostalgic connection many players felt for the franchise. This study shows how gameplay can build social connectedness through real-world engagement. © The Author(s) 2017.

TI  - A serious game designed to promote safe behaviors among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Development of “Escape COVID-19”
IS  - 4
VL  - 8
AB  - Background: As many countries fear and even experience the emergence of a second wave of COVID-19, reminding health care workers (HCWs) and other hospital employees of the critical role they play in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission is more important than ever. Building and strengthening the intrinsic motivation of HCWs to apply infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines to avoid contaminating their colleagues, patients, friends, and relatives is a goal that must be energetically pursued. A high rate of nosocomial infections during the first COVID-19 wave was detected by IPC specialists and further cemented their belief in the need for an engaging intervention that could improve compliance with COVID-19 safe behaviors. Objective: Our aim was to develop a serious game that would promote IPC practices with a specific focus on COVID-19 among HCWs and other hospital employees. Methods: The first 3 stages of the SERES framework were used to develop this serious game. A brainswarming session between developers and IPC specialists was used to identify the target audience and acquisition objectives. Nicholson’s RECIPE mnemonic (reflection, engagement, choice, information, play, exposition) for meaningful gamification was used to guide the general design. A common and simple terminology was used to suit the broad target audience. The game was tested on various platforms (smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktop computers) by different users during each development loop and before its final release. Results: The game was designed to target all hospital staff who could be in direct contact with patients within the Geneva University Hospitals. In total, 10 acquisition objectives were defined by IPC specialists and implemented into the game according to the principles of meaningful gamification. A simple storyboard was first created using Microsoft PowerPoint and was progressively refined through multiple iteration loops. Articulate Storyline was then used to create two successive versions of the actual game. In the final version, a unique graphic atmosphere was created with help from a professional graphic designer. Feedback mechanisms were used extensively throughout the game to strengthen key IPC messages. Conclusions: The SERES framework was successfully used to create “Escape COVID-19,” a serious game designed to promote safe IPC practices among HCWs and other hospital employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. This game can be obtained free of charge for research and educational purposes.

TI  - A serious game to increase healthy food consumption in overweight or obese adults: Randomized controlled trial
IS  - 2
VL  - 4
AB  - Background: Obesity is a growing global issue that is linked to cognitive and psychological deficits. Objective: This preliminary study investigated the efficacy of training to improve inhibitory control (IC), a process linked to overeating, on consumption and cognitive control factors. Methods: This study utilized a multisession mobile phone-based intervention to train IC in an overweight and obese population using a randomized waitlist-control design. A combination of self-assessment questionnaires and psychophysiological measures was used to assess the efficacy of the intervention in terms of improved general IC and modified food consumption after training. Attitudes toward food were also assessed to determine their mediating role in food choices. A total of 58 participants (47 female) completed 2 assessment sessions 3 weeks apart, with 2 weeks of intervention training for the training group during this time. The groups did not differ in baseline demographics including age, body mass index, and inhibitory control. Results: Inhibitory control ability improved across the training sessions, with increases in P3 amplitude implying increased cognitive control over responses. Inhibitory control training was associated with increased healthy and reduced unhealthy food consumption in a taste test and in the week following training, as measured by the Healthy Eating Quiz and the food consumption test. Cognitive restraint was enhanced after training for the training but not the waitlist condition in the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, implying that attempts to avoid unhealthy foods in the future will be easier for the training group participants. Conclusions: Inhibitory control training delivered via a purpose-designed mobile phone app is easy to complete, is convenient, and can increase cognitive restraint and reduce unhealthy food consumption. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.

TI  - A Serious Game to Self-Regulate Heart Rate Variability as a Technique to Manage Arousal Level Through Cardiorespiratory Biofeedback: Development and Pilot Evaluation Study
IS  - 1
VL  - 11
AB  - Background: Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) is an established intervention for increasing heart rate variability (HRV) in the clinical context. Using this technique, participants become aware of their HRV through real-time feedback and can self-regulate it. Objective: The aim of this study was 2-fold: first, to develop a serious game that applies the HRVB technique to teach participants to self-regulate HRV and, second, to test the app with participants in a pilot study. Methods: An HRVB app called the FitLab Game was developed for this study. To play the game, users must move the main character up and down the screen, avoiding collisions with obstacles. The wavelength that users must follow to avoid these obstacles is based on the user’s basal heart rate and changes in instantaneous heart rate. To test the FitLab Game, a total of 16 participants (mean age 23, SD 0.69 years) were divided into a control group (n=8) and an experimental group (n=8). A 2 × 2 factorial design was used in each session. Participants in the experimental condition were trained in breathing techniques. Results: Changes in the frequency and time domain parameters of HRV and the game’s performance features were evaluated. Significant changes in the average RR intervals and root mean square of differences between adjacent RR intervals (RMSSD) were found between the groups (P=.02 and P=.04, respectively). Regarding performance, both groups showed a tendency to increase the evaluated outcomes from baseline to the test condition. Conclusions: The results may indicate that playing different levels leads to an improvement in the game’s final score by repeated training. The tendency of changes in HRV may reflect a higher activation of the mental system of attention and control in the experimental group versus the control group. In this context, learning simple, voluntary strategies through a serious game can aid the improvement of self-control and arousal management. The FitLab Game appears to be a promising serious game owing to its ease of use, high engagement, and enjoyability provided by the instantaneous feedback. © 2023 JMIR Serious Games.

TI  - A Smartphone Game to Prevent HIV Among Young Africans: Protocol for a
Randomized Pilot Study of a Mobile Intervention
IS  - 3
VL  - 8
AB  - Background: Young people aged under 25 years make up an increasing
proportion of the population in emerging economies such as Kenya, where
half of new adult HIV infections are among 15- to 24-year olds.
Interventions targeting this age group have the potential to avert HIV
infections among an increasingly large at-risk population. Interactive
communication technologies offer a promising platform for reaching young
people in engaging ways.
Objective: Tumaini is a narrative-based smartphone game designed to help
young Africans protect themselves from HIV. The objective of this study
was to pilot test the game, focusing on the data needed to inform a
future randomized controlled efficacy trial, including assessments of
study feasibility and safety.
Methods: The study took place in Kisumu Town, western Kenya, in spring
2017. The game-based intervention was pilot tested for 16 days with a
sample of 60 preadolescents aged 11 to 14 years. Participant recruitment
was initiated through schools. Participants were randomly assigned to
the control or intervention arms of the study. One parent for each of
the intervention arm participants was also recruited (n=30). The
intervention arm participants were provided with smartphones on which
Tumaini was loaded so that they could play the game at home. Youth
completed behavioral surveys at baseline, posttest, and 6-week
follow-up. The intervention arm participants provided quantitative
feedback on their experience of the game-based intervention at posttest.
They and their parents further participated in postintervention focus
group discussions. Feasibility-related study metrics were collected on
recruitment, enrollment, attrition, safety of participants, and return
of phones.
Results: Recruitment and enrollment of the 60 preadolescents and parents
were successfully completed within 18 days. No participants were lost to
follow-up: all youth completed all 3 waves of the survey and 27
intervention arm youth and 22 parents and caregivers participated in the
focus groups. No safety concerns were reported. All phones were returned
after the intervention period; none were damaged or lost. All
intervention arm participants initiated gameplay, recording a mean
exposure time just under 27 hours.
Conclusions: Findings indicate that it is feasible and safe to test a
smartphone-based HIV prevention intervention for very young adolescents
in urban and peri-urban sub-Saharan Africa by initiating recruitment in
schools and temporarily providing youth participants with smartphones on
which the game is loaded. A randomized controlled trial powered to
assess the efficacy of the game-based intervention is being designed to
be carried out in the same geographic area as the pilot, using similar
methods.

TI  - A Smartphone Game to Prevent HIV Among Young Africans (Tumaini):
Assessing Intervention and Study Acceptability Among Adolescents and
Their Parents in a Randomized Controlled Trial
IS  - 5
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: Young people aged 15 to 24 years account for one-third of
new adult HIV infections. Controlling the HIV epidemic requires
effective interventions targeted toward young people and their needs.
Smartphone games offer a promising avenue for reaching this population
with evidence-based HIV prevention interventions. It is crucial to the
effectiveness of these interventions that they be acceptable and
intrinsically motivating to adolescents as well as acceptable to their
parents.
Objective: Tumaini is a narrative-based smartphone game designed to help
prevent HIV among young Africans aged 11 to 14 years by delaying first
sex and increasing condom use at first sex. Following a 16-day
feasibility study of Tumaini, we assessed the acceptability (1) of the
intervention, where acceptability was operationalized as appeal,
relevance, value, usability, and understandability, and (2) of this
study and a planned future randomized controlled efficacy trial.
Methods: During the randomized feasibility study (n=60) of Tumaini in
western Kenya in spring 2017, 30 participants used the intervention on a
study-provided smartphone. The app automatically logged participant
interaction with the game in time-stamped log files. All 30 participants
completed an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview-based game
experience survey, and 27 took part in 4 focus group discussions (FGDs)
about the game's appeal, relevance, value, usability, and
understandability. Their parents (n=22) also participated in 4 FGDs
about the acceptability of the intervention, of this study, and of a
planned efficacy trial. Survey data were analyzed using SAS software
(SAS Institute Inc); FGD transcripts were coded and analyzed in MAXQDA
12 (Verbi GmbH); and gameplay log files were analyzed using Microsoft
Excel.
Results: Adolescent participants' survey responses indicated that
Tumaini scored well with players on all indicators of acceptability
(appeal, relevance, value, usability, and understandability). Focus
group analyses aligned with these findings and emphasized a high degree
of player engagement with the game, which was supported by log file
analysis. Adolescent participants were eager for additional content, and
parents were receptive to a longer study involving biomarkers, based on
their positive experiences with this study. There is scope to improve
communication with parents about their role in the intervention. As the
game was tested in beta version, there is also scope to fine-tune some
of the game mechanics to increase usability.
Conclusions: This study shows the strong acceptability of an interactive
smartphone-based game both to adolescents and their parents in western
Kenya and that of the study methods used to pilot-test the intervention.
It also suggests that longitudinal efficacy studies of this type of
intervention, including those using biomarkers, have the potential to be
acceptable among parents.

TI  - A smartphone game to prevent HIV among young Kenyans: Household dynamics
of gameplay in a feasibility study
IS  - 5
VL  - 78
AB  - Objective: mHealth interventions often favour individual-level effects.
This is particularly problematic in contexts where social support and
shifts in social norms are critical to sustained behaviour change.
Mobile digital games represent a promising health education strategy for
youth, including in low-resource settings. We sought to better
understand the interpersonal and social interactions that can be
elicited by digital games for health. Design: We piloted Tumaini, a
smartphone game rooted in interactive narrative designed to prevent HIV
among young Africans (aged 11-14), in a randomised controlled
feasibility study and analysed reports of the household dynamics
surrounding gameplay. Following a 16-day intervention period, phone
gameplay log files were downloaded, and intervention arm participants (n
= 30) completed a gameplay experience survey; eight focus group
discussions were held, four with intervention arm participants (n = 27)
and four with their parents (n = 22). Setting: This study took place in
Kisumu, Kenya, in Spring 2017. Method: Descriptive statistics were
computed from survey responses and log files. Focus group transcripts
were labelled, analysed thematically and compared demographically using
MAXQDA software. Results: Data from log files, surveys and focus groups
indicate that the game generated considerable interaction and dialogue
with parents, siblings and friends and served as a catalyst for children
to act as advocates for healthful decisions about sex, both within the
family and beyond. The game showed a high level of acceptability with
parents. Conclusion: Serious digital games using a smartphone platform
can generate considerable household interaction. Games can model and
facilitate these exchanges, maximising multi-level effects. An
additional app for parents could reinforce these effects.

TI  - Assessing Autistic Traits, Hikikomori Tendencies, Pathological
Videogaming, and Eating Disorders in University Students: Are
Pathological Videogaming and Eating Disorders Gender-Specific
Manifestations of the Autism Spectrum?
IS  - 7
VL  - 14
AB  - In the previous literature, specific attention has been paid to
investigate autism spectrum symptoms and traits in university students.
In this framework, we aimed to evaluate the presence and correlates of
autistic traits, hikikomori tendencies, altered eating behaviors, and
pathological videogaming in a sample of Italian university students
enrolled in bachelor's degree courses. A total of 1192 students were
recruited via an online survey and assessed with the Hikikomori
Questionnaire-25, the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum Questionnaire,
the Eating Attitude test-26, and the Assessment of Internet and Computer
Game Addiction. Our results highlighted significant differences in the
prevalence of autistic traits, social withdrawal tendencies, altered
eating habits, and pathological videogame use in university students
based on gender, age, parents' level of instruction, and field of study.
A significant effect of the presence of autistic traits and gender on
the scores obtained with the other questionnaires was reported. Our
results not only support the role of autistic traits as a vulnerability
factor for the development of a set of psychopathological conditions but
also suggest that gender could modulate this vulnerability, supporting
the hypothesis of gender-specific phenotypes in the autism spectrum.

TI  - Assessment of cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis using
smartphone-based training games: a feasibility study
AB  - Background Cognitive impairment occurs in up to 70\% of people with MS
(pwMS) and has a large impact on quality of life and working capacity.
As part of the development of a smartphone-app (dreaMS) for monitoring
MS disease activity and progression, we assessed the feasibility and
acceptance of using cognitive games as assessment tools for cognitive
domains.
Methods We integrated ten cognitive games in the dreaMS app.
Participants were asked to play these games twice a week for 5 weeks.
All subjects underwent a battery of established neuropsychological
tests. User feedback on acceptance was obtained via a five-point
Likert-scale questionnaire. We correlated game performance measures with
predetermined reference tests (Spearman's rho) and analyzed differences
between pwMS and Healthy Controls (rank biserial correlation).
Results We included 31 pwMS (mean age 43.4 +/- 12.0 years; 68\% females;
median Expanded Disability Status Scale score 3.0, range 1.0-6.0) and 31
age- and sex-matched HC. All but one game showed moderate-strong
correlations with their reference tests, (|r(s)|= 0.34-0.77).
Performance improved in both groups over the 5 weeks. Average ratings
for overall impression and meaningfulness were 4.6 (range 4.2-4.9) and
4.7 (range 4.5-4.8), respectively.
Conclusion Moderate-strong correlations with reference tests suggest
that adaptive cognitive games may be used as measures of cognitive
domains. The practice effects observed suggest that game-derived
measures may capture change over time. All games were perceived as
enjoyable and meaningful, features crucial for long-term adherence. Our
results encourage further validation of adaptive cognitive games as
monitoring tools for cognition in larger studies of longer duration.

TI  - Association of a Television in the Bedroom With Increased Adiposity Gain
in a Nationally Representative Sample of Children and Adolescents
IS  - 5
VL  - 168
AB  - IMPORTANCE Obesity affects health in children and adolescents.
Television viewing is an established risk factor for obesity in youth.
No prospective study has assessed whether a bedroom television confers
an additional risk for obesity in youth.
OBJECTIVE To assess the prospective association between the presence of
a bedroom television and change in body mass index (BMI; calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), independent of
television viewing, in a nationally representative sample of US children
and adolescents.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a random-digit
prospective telephone survey that captured children and adolescents from
across the United States. Participants included 6522 boys and girls aged
10 to 14 years at baseline who were surveyed via telephone about media
risk factors for obesity. Weighted regressions assessed adiposity at 2-
and 4-year follow-up, controlling for television and movie viewing,
video-game playing, parenting, age, sex, race or ethnicity, household
income, and parental educational level.
EXPOSURE Report of having a television in the bedroom at baseline.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age-and sex-adjusted BMI based on self-report
and parent report of weight and height at 2- and 4-year follow-up.
RESULTS Distributions for age, sex, race or ethnicity, and socioeconomic
status were similar to census estimates for the US population. Sample
weighting methods accounted for higher dropout rates among ethnic
minorities and those with lower socioeconomic status. Bedroom
televisions were reported by 59.1\% of participants at baseline, with
boys, ethnic minorities, and those of lower socioeconomic status having
significantly higher rates. In multivariate analyses, having a bedroom
television was associated with an excess BMI of 0.57 (95\% CI,
0.31-0.82) and 0.75 (0.38-1.12) at years 2 and 4, respectively, and a
BMI gain of 0.24 (0.02-0.45) from years 2 to 4.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Having a bedroom television is associated with
weight gain beyond the effect of television viewing time. This
association could be the result of uncaptured effects of television
viewing or of disrupted sleep patterns. With the high prevalence of
bedroom televisions, the effect attributable to this risk factor among
US children and adolescents is excess weight of 8.7 million kg/y.

TI  - Association of Smartphone Use with Body Image Distortion and Weight Loss Behaviors in Korean Adolescents
IS  - 5
VL  - 5
AB  - Importance: Despite high use of smartphones among adolescents, little is known about the association of smartphone use with body image and related behaviors. Objective: To examine the associations of duration of smartphone use and types of content most frequently accessed via smartphone with body image distortion and weight loss behaviors in adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the population-based Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey 2017. Participants comprised a nationally representative sample of 53 133 Korean adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. Data were collected from June 1 to July 18, 2017. The analysis was performed from February 7, 2020, to March 30, 2022. Exposures: Self-reported duration of smartphone use (min/d) and types of content (educational or informational searches; chatting, messaging, or email; social networking services or forums; games; videos, movies, or music; webtoons or web novels; and shopping or other activities) most frequently accessed during smartphone use. Main Outcomes and Measures: Body image distortion (overperception of body weight), weight loss attempt, use of inappropriate weight loss strategies (skipping meals, eating only 1 food at a time, vomiting, or using laxatives), and healthy weight loss behaviors (muscle-strengthening and aerobic physical activity). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, accounting for survey sampling and adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Among 53133 participants, the mean (SD) age was 15.0 (1.8) years; 50.7% of participants were female, and 49.3% were male. After adjusting for types of content accessed, prolonged smartphone use (≥301 min/d) was positively associated with body image distortion (boys: OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.28; girls: OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10-1.30) and inappropriate weight loss strategies (boys: OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.25-1.90; girls: OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 2.14-2.79) in both sexes compared with minimal smartphone use (1-120 min/d). After adjusting for duration of smartphone use, the use of smartphones mainly for videos, movies, or music (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29), webtoons or web novels (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48), and games (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.32) was positively associated with body image distortion in boys compared with the use of smartphones mainly for educational or informational content. Among boys, the use of smartphones mainly for chatting, messaging, or email was positively associated with muscle-strengthening activity (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.18-1.44) and aerobic physical activity (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.29-1.55), as was the use of smartphones mainly for social networking services or forums (muscle-strengthening activity: OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.13-1.42; aerobic physical activity: OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.15-1.43). Among girls, the use of smartphones mainly for chatting, messaging, or email was positively associated with weight loss attempts (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.19-1.51) and the use of inappropriate weight loss strategies (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.25-1.99), as was the use of smartphones mainly for social networking services or forums (weight loss attempts: OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.07-1.36; use of inappropriate weight loss strategies: OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.08-1.73). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, both the duration of smartphone use and the types of content most frequently accessed via smartphone were associated with body image distortion and weight loss behaviors in adolescents. These findings suggest a need for the identification of strategies to help adolescents develop healthy smartphone use behaviors.. © 2022 Acoustical Society of America. All rights reserved.

TI  - Associations between adverse childhood experiences and early adolescent
problematic screen use in the United States
IS  - 1
VL  - 23
AB  - BackgroundProblematic screen use, defined as an inability to control use
despite private, social, and professional life consequences, is
increasingly common among adolescents and can have significant mental
and physical health consequences. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)
are important risk factors in the development of addictive behaviors and
may play an important role in the development of problematic screen
use.MethodsProspective data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development Study (Baseline and Year 2; 2018-2020; N = 9,673,
participants who did not use screens were excluded) were analyzed in
2023. Generalized logistic mixed effects models were used to determine
associations with ACEs and the presence of problematic use among
adolescents who used screens based on cutoff scores. Secondary analyses
used generalized linear mixed effects models to determine associations
between ACEs and adolescent-reported problematic use scores of video
games (Video Game Addiction Questionnaire), social media (Social Media
Addiction Questionnaire), and mobile phones (Mobile Phone Involvement
Questionnaire). Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders
including age, sex, race/ethnicity, highest parent education, household
income, adolescent anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit symptoms,
study site, and participants who were twins.ResultsThe 9,673
screen-using adolescents ages 11-12 years old (mean age 12.0) were
racially and ethnically diverse (52.9\% White, 17.4\% Latino/Hispanic,
19.4\% Black, 5.8\% Asian, 3.7\% Native American, 0.9\% Other).
Problematic screen use rates among adolescents were identified to be
7.0\% (video game), 3.5\% (social media), and 21.8\% (mobile phone).
ACEs were associated with higher problematic video game and mobile phone
use in both unadjusted and adjusted models, though problematic social
media use was associated with mobile screen use in the unadjusted model
only. Adolescents exposed to 4 or more ACEs experienced 3.1 times higher
odds of reported problematic video game use and 1.6 times higher odds of
problematic mobile phone use compared to peers with no
ACEs.ConclusionsGiven the significant associations between adolescent
ACE exposure and rates of problematic video and mobile phone screen use
among adolescents who use screens, public health programming for
trauma-exposed youth should explore video game, social media, and mobile
phone use among this population and implement interventions focused on
supporting healthy digital habits.

TI  - Associations between sexual orientation and early adolescent screen use: findings from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study
VL  - 82
AB  - Purpose: To assess the association between sexual orientation and screen use (screen time and problematic screen use) in a demographically diverse national sample of early adolescents in the United States. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from year 2 of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (N = 10,339, 2018–2020, ages 10–14 years). Multiple linear regression analyses estimated the association between sexual orientation and recreational screen time, as well as problematic use of video games, social media, and mobile phones. Results: In a sample of 10,339 adolescents (48.7% female, 46.0% racial/ethnic minority), sexual minority (compared to heterosexual) identification was associated with 3.72 (95% CI 2.96–4.47) more hours of daily recreational screen time, specifically more time on television, YouTube videos, video games, texting, social media, video chat, and browsing the internet. Possible sexual minority identification (responding “maybe” to the sexual minority question) was associated with 1.58 (95% CI 0.92–2.24) more hours of screen time compared to heterosexual identification. Sexual minority and possible sexual minority identification were associated with higher problematic social media, video games, and mobile phone use. Conclusions: Sexual minority adolescents spend a disproportionate amount of time engaging in screen-based activities, which can lead to problematic screen use. © 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - A survey of exemplar teachers' perceptions, use, and access of computer-based games and technology for classroom instruction
VL  - 62
AB  - This research reports and analyzes for archival purposes surveyed perceptions, use, and access by 259 United States based exemplar Primary and Secondary educators of computer-based games and technology for classroom instruction. Participating respondents were considered exemplary as they each won the Milken Educator Award during the 1996-2009 computer era. Overall perceptions are reported along with trend, differences in perceptions by subject area taught, and differences in perception by Primary and Secondary teacher population categories. Overall game usage is reported along with association of perceptions with game usage as well as usage differences due to grade category. Among other findings, adoption of computer-based games for educational use in the classroom by exemplar Primary teacher populations appeared to be in the Late Majority stage of the Rogers Technology Adoption Curve while adoption in the classroom by exemplar Secondary teacher populations appeared to be in the beginning of the Early Majority stage. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A survey of video game preferences in adults: Building better games for older adults
VL  - 21
AB  - As the average North American gets older, there is an increasing need to develop better rehabilitation and wellness software for the aging. Although the use of computerized entertainment is becoming more prevalent with older adults, knowledge of their preferences and usage habits is still limited. In order to understand how preferences might change over a lifespan, we conducted a survey of older and younger adults (N = 426). The goal of this analysis was to determine in what ways the electronic preferences and activities of older adults differed from younger cohorts. Our results showed that older adult respondents generally indicated a preference for games that were easy to learn and play, but also challenging, with puzzle & strategy games being the most popular. Older adults also indicated that they played games alone rather than with friends. Finally, although younger adults used a wider variety of electronic devices, most older adults reported regularly using at least one device capable of accessing video games such as a desktop computer. These results broaden our knowledge of older adults’ preferences and usage patterns for computerized entertainment, as compared to a younger cohort. These survey results can serve as a resource for game designers. © 2017

TI  - A Systematic Review of Apps using Mobile Criteria for Adolescent
Pregnancy Prevention (mCAPP)
IS  - 4
VL  - 4
AB  - Background: Adolescents in the United States and globally represent a
high-risk population for unintended pregnancy, which leads to high
social, economic, and health costs. Access to smartphone apps is rapidly
increasing among youth, but little is known about the strategies that
apps employ to prevent pregnancy among adolescents and young adults.
Further, there are no guidelines on best practices for adolescent and
young adult pregnancy prevention through mobile apps.
Objective: This review developed a preliminary evaluation framework for
the assessment of mobile apps for adolescent and young adult pregnancy
prevention and used this framework to assess available apps in the Apple
App Store and Google Play that targeted adolescents and young adults
with family planning and pregnancy prevention support.
Methods: We developed an assessment rubric called Mobile Criteria for
Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention (mCAPP) for data extraction using
evidence-based and promising best practices from the literature. mCAPP
comprises 4 domains: (1) app characteristics, (2) user interface
features, (3) adolescent pregnancy prevention best practices, and (4)
general sexual and reproductive health (SRH) features. For inclusion in
the review, apps that advertised pregnancy prevention services and
explicitly mentioned youth, were in English, and were free were
systematically identified in the Apple App Store and Google Play in
2015. Screening, data extraction, and 4 interrater reliability checks
were conducted by 2 reviewers. Each app was assessed for 92 facets of
the mCAPP checklist.
Results: Our search returned 4043 app descriptions in the Apple App
Store (462) and Google Play (3581). After screening for inclusion
criteria, 22 unique apps were included in our analysis. Included apps
targeted teens in primarily developed countries, and the most common
user interface features were clinic and health service locators. While
app strengths included provision of SRH education, description of modern
contraceptives, and some use of evidence-based adolescent best
practices, gaps remain in the implementation of the majority of
adolescent best practices and user interface features. Of the 8 best
practices for teen pregnancy prevention operationalized through mCAPP,
the most commonly implemented best practice was the provision of
information on how to use contraceptives to prevent pregnancy (15/22),
followed by provision of accurate information on pregnancy risk of
sexual behaviors (13/22); information on SRH communication, negotiation,
or refusal skills (10/22); and the use of persuasive language around
contraceptive use (9/22).
Conclusions: The quality and scope of apps for adolescent pregnancy
prevention varies, indicating that developers and researchers may need a
supportive framework. mCAPP can help researchers and developers consider
mobile-relevant evidence-based best practices for adolescent SRH as they
develop teen pregnancy prevention apps. Given the novelty of the mobile
approach, further research is needed on the impact of mCAPP criteria via
mobile channels on adolescent health knowledge, behaviors, and outcomes.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Computer Science Solutions for Addressing Violence Against Women and Children
IS  - 
VL  - 9
AB  - Violence against women and children is a public health issue of pandemic proportions. It is estimated that one in every three women worldwide has experienced physical, emotional, or sexual violence. Similarly, each year one out of two children are victims of some form of violence including domestic aggression and bullying. Due to the widespread use of the Internet and social media, women and children are now vulnerable to other types of violence such as cyber-bullying and online sexual or emotional harassment. To help alleviate this social problem, the use of computer science and related technologies has been leveraged in recent years. The Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, ubiquitous and mobile computing, pattern recognition, cloud computing and similar technologies, have been used to formulate solutions to detect and prevent violent acts against women and children. In this paper, a systematic review of some of the efforts that can help address the problem of violence against women and children is presented. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art of these contributions and identifies trends, architectures, technologies, and current open challenges. The survey was developed using a literature review of academic documents published from 2010 to 2020. The contributions were categorized into four application domains: online detection, offline detection, safety, and education. These contributions were further categorized based on the computer science approaches and technologies used: artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and digital serious games.

TI  - A Systematic Review to Know How Interventions Realized with Immersive Virtual Reality-Based Serious Games for Individuals with Autism are Evaluated
AB  - Today, the growing diffusion of Information Communication Technology and the concomitant system cost reductions encouraged, even more, the exploitation of innovative solutions, especially in the field of interventions for autism. The need for efficient and effective interventions for autism is becoming more pressing for several reasons ranging from the dramatic increase in its prevalence to the high direct and indirect costs of its care over a lifetime. Among all Information Communication Technology-based interventions for autism, those realized with Immersive Virtual Reality based Serious Games appear to be the most promising. However, even if an intervention is considered promising for a clinical population does not mean that it is also efficient and effective. In fact, to be efficient and effective, an intervention must be evidence-based. Unfortunately, nowadays, there is a lack of evaluation protocols that allow for avoiding methodological biases thus providing interventions evidence-based. Consequently, clinicians are reluctant to use these interventions in clinical practice. This awareness led to the emergence of the research question of this systematic review: how interventions realized with Immersive Virtual Reality based Serious Games for individuals with autism are evaluated? The present systematic review answered this research question showing consistent methodological issues related to how these kinds of interventions are evaluated and laying the foundation for a reflection on the need to create specific evaluation protocols to overcome these issues and promoting thus the blossoming of rigorous studies on this topic.

TI  - A Technology-Enriched Approach to Studying Microlongitudinal Aging Among
Adults Aged 18 to 85 Years: Protocol for the Labs Without Walls Study
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: Traditional longitudinal aging research involves studying
the same individuals over a long period, with measurement intervals
typically several years apart. App-based studies have the potential to
provide new insights into life-course aging by improving the
accessibility, temporal specificity, and real-world integration of data
collection. We developed a new research app for iOS named Labs Without
Walls to facilitate the study of life-course aging. Combined with data
collected using paired smartwatches, the app collects complex data
including data from one-time surveys, daily diary surveys, repeated
game-like cognitive and sensory tasks, and passive health and
environmental data.Objective: The aim of this protocol is to describe
the research design and methods of the Labs Without Walls study
conducted between 2021 and 2023 in Australia.Methods: Overall, 240
Australian adults will be recruited, stratified by age group (18-25,
26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56-65, 66-75, and 76-85 years) and sex at birth
(male and female). Recruitment procedures include emails to university
and community networks, as well as paid and unpaid social media
advertisements. Participants will be invited to complete the study
onboarding either in person or remotely. Participants who select
face-to-face onboarding (n=approximately 40) will be invited to complete
traditional in-person cognitive and sensory assessments to be
cross-validated against their app-based counterparts. Participants will
be sent an Apple Watch and headphones for use during the study period.
Participants will provide informed consent within the app and then begin
an 8-week study protocol, which includes scheduled surveys, cognitive
and sensory tasks, and passive data collection using the app and a
paired watch. At the conclusion of the study period, participants will
be invited to rate the acceptability and usability of the study app and
watch. We hypothesize that participants will be able to successfully
provide e-consent, input survey data through the Labs Without Walls app,
and have passive data collected over 8 weeks; participants will rate the
app and watch as user-friendly and acceptable; the app will allow for
the study of daily variability in self-perceptions of age and gender;
and data will allow for the cross-validation of app-and laboratory-based
cognitive and sensory tasks.Results: Recruitment began in May 2021, and
data collection was completed in February 2023. The publication of
preliminary results is anticipated in 2023.Conclusions: This study will
provide evidence regarding the acceptability and usability of the
research app and paired watch for studying life-course aging processes
on multiple timescales. The feedback obtained will be used to improve
future iterations of the app, explore preliminary evidence for
intraindividual variability in self-perceptions of aging and gender
expression across the life span, and explore the associations between
performance on app-based cognitive and sensory tests and that on similar
traditional cognitive and sensory tests.

TI  - A trading-card game teaching about host defence
IS  - 12
VL  - 36
AB  - Objectives: To heighten the understanding of host-disease interactions by adolescents and young adults, using a trading card game format. Design: A trading card game was developed in which paired students attack one another with pathogens or parry those attacks with appropriate defences. Twenty-five infectious pathogens or cancers, 30 defence agents and 6 health status modifying conditions were included. Setting: A middle school, upper school and medical school in the United States. Subjects: 8th grade, 10th grade and first year medical students. Results: The game was tested using pre-test/post-test evaluations in 8th graders, 10th graders and medical students. Factual information, pathogen-organ specificity, and general concepts were tested. There was a significant increase in test scores, from 39% to 58% correct in the 8th graders (P < 0.0001), from 47% to 59% among 10th graders (P = 0.0007), and from 80% to 88% (P = 0.049) among the medical students. Responses to control questions unrelated to the game did not improve. Conclusion: An interactive trading card format is a useful method for conveying information about host defence.

TI  - At-risk adolescents as experts in a new requirements elicitation procedure for the development of a smart phone psychoeducational trauma-informed care application
IS  - 1
VL  - 42
AB  - Background/Purpose: Adolescents from urban, socioeconomically disadvantaged communities of color encounter high rates of adverse childhood experiences. To address the resulting multidimensional problems, we developed an innovative approach, Experiential Participatory and Interactive Knowledge Elicitation (EPIKE), using remote experiential needs elicitation methods to generate design and content requirements for a mobile health (mHealth) psychoeducational intervention. Methods: At a community-based organization in a northeastern city, the research team developed EPIKE by incorporating elicitation of input on the graphics and conducting remotely recorded experiential meetings and iterative reviews of the design to produce an mHealth smartphone story application (app) prototype for the participants to critique. The 22 participants were 13- to 17-year-olds, predominantly African American and female, from underresourced communities. Results: The four goals of the design process were attained: 1) story development from participant input; 2) needs-elicitation that reflected the patient-centered care approach; 3) interactive story game creation that accommodates the participants’ emotional and cognitive developmental needs; 4) development of a game that adolescents can relate to and that which matches their comfort levels of emotional intensity. Conclusions: The EPIKE approach can be used successfully to identify the needs of adolescents across the digital divide to inform the design and development of mHealth apps. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Atypical brain activation patterns during a face-to-face joint attention game in adults with autism spectrum disorder
IS  - 10
VL  - 34
AB  - Joint attention behaviors include initiating one's own and responding to another's bid for joint attention to an object, person, or topic. Joint attention abilities in autism are pervasively atypical, correlate with development of language and social abilities, and discriminate children with autism from other developmental disorders. Despite the importance of these behaviors, the neural correlates of joint attention in individuals with autism remain unclear. This paucity of data is likely due to the inherent challenge of acquiring data during a real-time social interaction. We used a novel experimental set-up in which participants engaged with an experimenter in an interactive face-to-face joint attention game during fMRI data acquisition. Both initiating and responding to joint attention behaviors were examined as well as a solo attention (SA) control condition. Participants included adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n = 13), a mean age- and sex-matched neurotypical group (n = 14), and a separate group of neurotypical adults (n = 22). Significant differences were found between groups within social-cognitive brain regions, including dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), during the RJA as compared to SA conditions. Region-of-interest analyses revealed a lack of signal differentiation between joint attention and control conditions within left pSTS and dMPFC in individuals with ASD. Within the pSTS, this lack of differentiation was characterized by reduced activation during joint attention and relative hyper-activation during SA. These findings suggest a possible failure of developmental neural specialization within the STS and dMPFC to joint attention in ASD. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Audible efforts: Gender and battle cries in classic arcade fighting games
IS  - 4
VL  - 7
AB  - Video games are demanding work indeed. So demanding that our screen heroes and heroines are constantly making sounds of strife, struggle, or victory while conducting surrogate labor for us running, fighting, saving worlds. These sounds also represent the very real demanding labor of voice actors, whose burnout and vocal strain have recently come to the fore in terms of the games industries’ labor standards (Cazden, 2017). But do heroes and she-roes sound the same? What are the demands—virtual, physical, and emotional—of maintaining sexist sonic tropes in popular media; demands that are required of the industry, the game program, and the player alike? Based on participatory observations of gameplay (i.e., the research team engaging with the material by playing the games we study), close reading of gendered sonic presence, and a historical content analysis of three iconic arcade fighting games, this article reports on a notable trend: As games selfpurportedly and in the eyes of the wider community improve the visual representation of female playable leads important aspects of the vocal representation of women has not only lagged behind but become more exaggeratedly gendered with higher-fidelity bigger-budget game productions. In essence, femininity continues to be a disempowering design pattern in ways far more nuanced than sexualization alone. This media ecology implicates not only the history of best practices for the games industry itself, but also the culture of professional voice acting, and the role of games as trendsetters for industry conventions of media representation. Listening to battle cries is discussed here as a politics of embodiment and a form of emotionally demanding game labor that simultaneously affects the flow and immersion of playing, and carries over toxic attitudes about femininity outside the game context. © 2019, Cogitatio Press.

TI  - Audience participation digital drama-based learning activities for situational learning in the classroom
IS  - 1
VL  - 53
AB  - In this study, the transformational play approach was further used to deploy drama-based situational learning in the classroom through the Digital Learning Theatre (DLT) by engaging drama performers and the audience collaboratively. This study analysed the learners' learning effectiveness based on translation and sentence-construction abilities, and their perception by focussing on concentration, and comprehension of dialogues before and after the drama-based activity. The experimental results were based on both the DLT including tablet PCs to enable audience participation in drama performances, and the DLT for drama performances in which the audience can participate through traditional open discussion sessions with the narrator of the drama. Sixty-five students were selected randomly as participants from the English as a Foreign Language academic program at the junior high school level. The application of the DLT including the tablet PCs approach showed considerable improvement in students' learning effectiveness as well as a significant positive effect on classroom learning, outperform the effectiveness of the DLT with traditional open discussion sessions for the audience. Accordingly, to improve students' learning effectiveness, their engagement in the learning process can be advanced through situational learning activities using educational technologies that combine with collaborative learning mechanisms for classroom learning. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The transformational play proposed by Sasha Barab is designed based on situated cognition theory to position persons, content, and context together through digital games. Dorothy Heathcote proposed a drama-based learning approach for learning in the classroom, and learners can play various roles in the drama to learn in a situational learning setting. The teacher, too, plays a role to guide the students and engage them in the situational learning setting. Integration of immersive educational technologies supports learning by reducing obstacles to adoption in the learning process and improve learning effectiveness. Within a rich contextual learning environment, learners can be placed in different situational learning tasks that allow them to apply existing knowledge and experiences. What does this paper add This study introduces a manner of applying the transformational play approach in drama-based situational learning activities suitable for collaborative learning in a classroom setting. It introduces a practical and simple method to transform a regular classroom into a digital version of the learning theatre, including a virtual stage to drama performances. The drama-based situational learning approach facilitates the audience as well as the performers to transform themselves into protagonists in the learning context by collaboratively following the learning content and learning with their peers. The technology-enhanced drama-based situational learning approach is introduced based on the transformation play approach that allows the students to learn situationally through different script instances, and improves their learning effectiveness by helping them understand the learning content through performing, participating, watching, and interacting in the learning context. Implications for practice and/or policy Learners can apply their prior knowledge and experiences creatively through drama-based learning activities, and interactive engagement allows the audience to participate in the learning process equally as drama performers. Educators and learning system developers can implement this approach to facilitate situational practice and discuss learning content. The learning process supports the reinterpretation of the learners' experiences and reflects on how to procure/adopt new knowledge and apply it to real-life situations. Drama performance is a collaborative/group learning task and it is performed for the audience. Students with higher achievements will help students with lower achievements so that everyone can contribute in the learning process to achieve their learning objectives. © 2021 British Educational Research Association

TI  - AutoGym: An Exertion Game for Autonomous Driving
AB  - In-car exercises are a promising way to keep the inactive driver of future autonomous cars in good shape and alert of the situation around them. To explore how to implement exercises into the car context, we designed AutoGym, an in-car fitness program that translates frustrating traffic into a fun exertion game. To progress in the game, the players must anticipate changes to the traffic situation they are exposed to in the car and work-out against their prediction. In this paper, we present the conceptual design of AutoGym and report what we have learnt from an explorative user study with 28 participants. Furthermore, from the design process and the evaluation, we derived three strategies for implementing exertion games. We found that these strategies helped to conceptualize exertion games as a playful embodiment of the dynamics of driving and as such, can positively influence the experience of control, orientation and situational awareness i.e. experiential factors that can be crucial for facilitating future autonomous driving in a pleasurable and safe way.

TI  - Automated mechanism design with co-evolutionary hierarchical genetic programming techniques
AB  - We present a novel form of automated game theoretic mechanism design in which mechanisms and players co-evolve. We also model the memetic propagation of strategies through a population of players, and argue that this process represents a more accurate depiction of human behavior than conventional economic models. The resulting model is evaluated by evolving mechanisms for the ultimatum game, and replicates the results of empirical studies of human economic behaviors, as well as demonstrating the ability to evaluate competing hypothesizes for the creation of economic incentives.

TI  - Automatic addition of physics components to procedural content
AB  - While the field of procedural content generation is growing, there has been somewhat less work on developing procedural methods to animate these models. We present a technique for generating procedural models of trees and buildings via formal grammars (L-Systems and wall grammars) that are ready to be animated using physical simulation. The grammars and their interpretations are augmented to provide direct control over the physical animation, by, for example, specifying object mass and the joint stiffness. Example animations produced by our system include trees swaying in a gentle wind or being rocked by a gale, and buildings collapsing, imploding or exploding. In user testing, we had test subjects (n = 20) compare our animations with video of trees and buildings undergoing similar effects, as well as with animations in games that they have played. Results show that our animations appear physically accurate with a few minor instances of unrealistic behaviour. Users considered the animations to be more realistic than those used in current video games.

TI  - Avatars using computer/smartphone mediated communication and social
networking in prevention of sexually transmitted diseases among
North-Norwegian youngsters
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), especially the
Chlamydia trachomatis bacterial infection, a common cause of
infertility, are highly prevalent in developed countries, and a worrying
problem in North Norway, where the incidence of chlamydia twice the
Norwegian average. Seventy percent of reported chlamydia cases are found
in people below 25 years of age, and although its spread could be
controlled with proper prevention, young people are more aware of the
risks of unwanted pregnancy than their risk of acquiring a STD.
Information and Communication Technologies, including, the Internet,
social media and/or smartphones, should be valued for sexual health
promotion for their potential to engage young audiences. And in these
media, avatars guarantee anonymity to users when handling sensitive
information. The main objective of this project is to achieve that North
Norwegian youngsters become more aware of STDs through the use of
popular technologies among young people.
Methods: A Virtual Clinic for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (VCSTD) will
be developed. The VCSTD will provide early guidance and reliable
information sources concerning reproductive health, delivered in a novel
and innovative way to the younger population. The VCSTD consists of an
``avatar{''} supported intervention in a serious gaming and e-learning
environment, which will bypass direct physical access (in person) to
reliable medical information, as well as allowing the youngsters to
share that information in social media, and thus helping the VCSTD to be
disseminated to more people.
Data analyses will be conducted on publically available health data
relevant to STDs in Troms and Finnmark, like the absolute number of
chlamydia tests, the amount of emergency contraception medication sold,
and the number of abortions. Also, usage data of the system and
experiences of usefulness will be explored through participants'
voluntary responses to a feedback form available in the VCSTD.
Discussion: This study will examine the usefulness of an online public
health intervention that aims to promote healthy sexual practices among
North-Norwegian youngsters. If shown to be effective, the intervention
could prove to be an affordable and widely accessible intervention to
decrease risky sexual practices in younger population.

TI  - A videogame intervention for tobacco product use prevention in adolescents
VL  - 91
AB  - Purpose: This pilot study evaluated the short-term effects of an interactive videogame on changing adolescent knowledge, beliefs and risk perceptions, and intentions to use e-cigarettes, cigarettes, and other tobacco products. A secondary aim was to evaluate players’ game experience. Methods: Participants (N = 80 11–14 year olds) were recruited from 7 community-based afterschool programs in New Haven, Connecticut and Los Angeles, California. The design was a single group pre-post design with replication. A pre-test survey was administered that included demographic variables and knowledge, risk perceptions, beliefs, and intentions to use e-cigarettes, cigarettes, and other tobacco products. An interactive videogame focusing on risky tobacco use situations was subsequently played in four 60-min sessions over a four-week period, followed by a post-test survey. Analyses included paired t-tests of pre-post videogame change, regression analyses, and path analyses testing mediational effects of beliefs and risk perceptions on the relationship between knowledge and intentions. Results: The videogame changed knowledge of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products (p's < 0.001), risk perceptions of cigarettes and e-cigarettes (p <.01 and p <.001, respectively), and beliefs about e-cigarettes and other tobacco products (p's < 0.05), but not intentions. Older adolescents reported greater e-cigarette knowledge and risk perceptions (p's < 0.05), and females reported greater risk perception of cigarettes (p <.05). Beliefs mediated the relationship between knowledge and intentions to use e-cigarettes (indirect effect p <.05). Conclusion: Results suggest that brief exposure (4 h over 4 weeks) to a videogame focused on changing knowledge and attitudes towards tobacco products may have a promising effect on preventing risk for early adolescent tobacco product use, particularly for e-cigarettes. © 2018

TI  - A Web-Based Game for Young Adolescents to Improve Parental Communication
and Prevent Unintended Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Infections
(The Secret of Seven Stones): Development and Feasibility Study
IS  - 1
VL  - 9
AB  - Background: Early adolescent unintended pregnancy and sexually
transmitted infection prevention are significant public health
challenges in the United States. Parental influence can help adolescents
make responsible and informed sexual health decisions toward delayed
sexual debut; yet parents often feel ill equipped to communicate about
sex-related topics. Intergenerational games offer a potential strategy
to provide life skills training to young adolescents (aged 11-14 years)
while engaging them and their parents in communication about sexual
health.
Objective: This study aims to describe the development of a web-based
online sexual health intergenerational adventure game, the Secret of
Seven Stones (SSS), using an intervention mapping (IM) approach for
developing theory- and evidence-based interventions.
Methods: We followed the IM development steps to describe a theoretical
and empirical model for young adolescent sexual health behavior, define
target behaviors and change objectives, identify theory-based methods
and practical applications to inform design and function, develop and
test a prototype of 2 game levels to assess feasibility before
developing the complete 18-level game, draft an implementation plan that
includes a commercial dissemination strategy, and draft an evaluation
plan including a study design for a randomized controlled trial efficacy
trial of SSS.
Results: SSS comprised an adventure game for young adolescent skills
training delivered via a desktop computer, a text-based notification
system to provide progress updates for parents and cues to initiate
dialogue with their 11- to 14-year-old child, and a website for parent
skills training and progress monitoring. Formative prototype testing
demonstrated feasibility for in-home use and positive usability ratings.
Conclusions: The SSS intergenerational game provides a unique addition
to the limited cadre of home-based programs that facilitate parent
involvement in influencing young adolescent behaviors and reducing
adolescent sexual risk taking. The IM framework provided a logical and
thorough approach to development and testing, attentive to the need for
theoretical and empirical foundations in serious games for health.

TI  - A Web-Based Gaming Approach to Decrease HIV-Related Stigma: Game Development and Mixed Methods Evaluation
IS  - 4
VL  - 10
AB  - Background: The stigma faced by people living with HIV causes difficulties in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Decreasing this stigma is thus no less urgent than implementing behavioral interventions. Serious games are being increasingly adopted as an intervention mechanism to control HIV/AIDS around the world. However, the development and evaluation of these games in China are far from adequate. Objective: This research aimed to help decrease HIV-related stigma in China via the development and evaluation of a serious game, as well as promote a participatory gamification culture for health interventions. Methods: Initially, a serious game was developed using free resources from a user-generated content website. Then, quantitative and qualitative methods were employed for game evaluation. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to explore the game’s effect on HIV-related stigma. The trial included 167 university students, who were randomly allocated to game and control groups. After the experimental evaluation, focus group discussions were held with 64 participants, who were invited to form 16 groups. Results: The game was called The Second Kind of Life with HIV (SKLWH), which is a free online game that can be played on computers and smartphones. This game hopes to publicize that people living with HIV can live a normal life, that is, a second life different from that imagined by the public. Based on the gamification practice of SKLWH, the participatory serious game development model (PSGDM) was proposed, which guided the development of 3 other HIV-themed games. The trial showed that intimacy stigma was much more severe than morality stigma and personal interaction stigma. Females were more tolerant of morality stigma than males (mean score: 1.29 vs 1.50; P=.01). The game intervention showed an advantage in decreasing intimacy stigma (mean score [game vs control]: 2.43 vs 2.73; P=.04). The group discussions validated the quantitative results and provided further in-depth information. The game intervention was largely preferred by participants, and the belief in intimacy impossibility was commonly expressed by participants when considering their relationship with people living with HIV. Conclusions: HIV/AIDS education should adopt appropriate media interventions to mitigate different dimensions of HIV-related stigma. Serious games should be used to decrease intimacy stigma, which is the hardest form to diminish. It is expected that the PSGDM can promote the development of more health games. Furthermore, HIV/AIDS intervention requires interdisciplinary efforts and cooperation that will allow more people to participate and share the responsibility of promoting health. ©Xiaoxiao Zhang, Erman Lai.

TI  - Barriers and Facilitators to HIV Testing Among Adolescents and Young
Adults in Washington, District of Columbia: Formative Research to Inform
the Development of an mHealth Intervention
IS  - 3
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) in the United States, and
in Washington, District of Columbia (DC), specifically, are
disproportionately affected by HIV. Both the national Ending the HIV
Epidemic initiative and DC-specific plans emphasize HIV testing, and
innovative strategies to encourage testing among AYA are needed.
Objective: The purpose of this study is to identify sexual behaviors,
HIV knowledge, HIV perceptions (eg, susceptibility and severity), and
perceived barriers and facilitators to HIV testing among AYA at risk for
HIV in DC.
Methods: This study was part of a larger study to determine the
acceptability of using a life-and-dating simulation game to increase HIV
testing among AYA. Focus groups and surveys stratified by self-reported
sexual orientation were conducted among, and administered to, AYA aged
13-24 years in DC. HIV knowledge was explored during focus groups and
measured using an adapted version of the Brief HIV Knowledge
Questionnaire. Survey data were summarized using descriptive statistics
and compared by self-reported sexual orientation. Transcripts were
thematically analyzed.
Results: Of the 46 AYA who participated in the focus groups, 30 (65\%)
identified as heterosexual and 16 (35\%) as lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, or queer. A higher proportion of lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, or queer AYA reported sexual activity (12/16, 75\%, vs
18/30, 60\%), condomless sex (11/12, 92\%, vs 15/18, 83\%), and HIV
testing (13/16, 81\%, vs 17/29, 58\%) than heterosexual AYA. HIV
prevention ({''}condoms{''} and ``...PrEP{''}) and transmission
({''}exchange of fluids{''}) knowledge was high, and most (34/44, 77\%)
of the AYA perceived HIV testing as beneficial. However, the AYA also
demonstrated some misinformation concerning HIV: an average of 67\%
(31/46; SD 0.474) of the participants believed that an HIV test could
deliver accurate results 1 week after a potential exposure and an
average of 72\% (33/46; SD 0.455) believed that an HIV vaccine exists.
The AYA also identified individual ({''}...people...are scared{''}),
interpersonal ({''}it's an awkward conversation{''}), and structural
({''}...people don't...know where they can go{''}) barriers to testing.
Most of the AYA indicated that they were very likely to use the
demonstrated game prototype to help with getting tested for HIV (median
3.0, IQR 2.0-3.0, using a scale ranging from 0 to 3, with 3 indicating
high likelihood) and strongly agreed that the game was interesting
(median 5.0, IQR 5.0-5.0), fun (median 5.0, IQR 4.0-5.0), and easy to
learn (median 5.0, IQR 5.0-5.0, using a scale ranging from 1 to 5, with
5 indicating strong agreement).
Conclusions: These results suggest a need for multilevel HIV testing
interventions and informed the development of a mobile health
intervention aiming to increase HIV knowledge and risk perception among
AYA, while reducing barriers to testing at the individual and structural
levels, supporting efforts to end the domestic HIV epidemic.

TI  - ``Because if we don't talk about it, how are we going to prevent
it?'': <i>Lucidity</i>, a narrative-based digital game about sexual
violence
IS  - 4
VL  - 16
AB  - This paper describes the development and evaluation of an interactive,
narrative-based, multimedia game to promote learning and communication
about sexual violence and health topics. High school-aged participants
created the game concept in a three-week workshop, after which assets
were assembled and refined by a university-based game design lab. The
outcome, Lucidity, was a multimedia game with a nonlinear narrative that
led to two different outcomes based on player decisions. The narrative
followed the life of one character, an African American woman named
Zaria who remembers and grapples with a sexual assault from her past.
The player discovers parts of the story by reading comics, watching
videos, navigating interactive websites and playing short videogames.
The final evaluation consisted of gameplay, a post-game focus group and
follow-up interviews. Twenty-four young people participated in three
focus group discussions (n=9, n=5, n=10); 23 participated in the
follow-up interviews. Salient themes identified in the focus group
discussions included: overall approval of the game, the acquisition of
new knowledge and minimal past exposure to conversations or education
about sexual violence. At follow-up, almost all (n=22) had initiated a
conversation about sexual violence with a parent, peer and/or teacher.
Lucidity succeeded in engaging young people and facilitating
communication with adults and peers regarding sexual violence and other
sexual health topics. Ultimately, a game-based intervention such as this
represents a feasible approach for introducing issues of sexual
violence, with potential for future implementation in educational
settings.

TI  - Bedtime screen use behaviors and sleep outcomes: Findings from the
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study
IS  - 4
VL  - 9
AB  - Objectives: To determine associations between bedtime screen time
behaviors and sleep outcomes in a national study of early
adolescents.Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 10,280 early
adolescents aged 10-14 (48.8\% female) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development Study (Year 2, 2018-2020). Regression analyses examined the
association between self-reported bedtime screen use and self-and
caregiver-reported sleep measures, including sleep disturbance symptoms,
controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, household income, parent
edu-cation, depression, data collection period (pre-vs. during COVID-19
pandemic), and study site.Results: Overall, 16\% of adolescents had at
least some trouble falling or staying asleep in the past 2 weeks and
28\% had overall sleep disturbance, based on caregiver reports.
Adolescents who had a television or an Internet-connected electronic
device in the bedroom had a greater risk of having trouble falling or
staying asleep (adjusted risk ratio 1.27, 95\% CI 1.12-1.4 4) and
overall sleep disturbance (adjusted risk ratio 1.15, 95\% CI 1.06-1.25).
Adolescents who left their phone ringer activated overnight had more
trouble falling/staying asleep and greater overall sleep disturbance
compared to those who turned off their cell phones at bedtime. Streaming
movies, playing video games, listening to music, talking/texting on the
phone, and using social media or chat rooms were all associated with
trouble falling/staying asleep and sleep disturbance.Conclusions:
Several bedtime screen use behaviors are associated with sleep
disturbances in early adoles-cents. The study's findings can inform
guidance for specific bedtime screen behaviors among early
ado-lescents.\& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of

TI  - Behavioral addiction and autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review
VL  - 117
AB  - Background: According to DSM-5 criteria, Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficiencies in social communication and interaction along with the presence of restrictive and repetitive patterns of behavior. Few studies have explored the prevalence of behavioral addiction in individuals with ASD. Since addiction and ASD share common characteristics, individuals with ASD may be more vulnerable to addictive behaviors. Some typical behavioral addictions include internet, gaming, and gambling addiction. While most previous studies on ASD and addiction have looked at chemical addiction, behavioral addiction has not been thoroughly studied to date. Aims: The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of behavioral addiction among individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Methods and procedures: A systematic literature search of five databases was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Search results were reviewed for the predetermined inclusion criteria independently by two authors. Outcomes and results: The search yielded 539 publications after the removal of duplicates. 61 met the inclusion criteria for title and abstract review. Full texts were reviewed resulting in an additional 31 being removed. The remaining 30 included 4 case reports and 26 original studies. Results included 27 studies that found a positive correlation (15 of significance, 12 of unknown significance) between a behavioral addiction and either ASD or Autistic traits, 1 found a significant negative correlation, 3 did not find a correlation. Conclusions and implications: This review is inconclusive about links between ASD and behavioral addictions. While a vast majority of studies show a positive correlation, many do not provide the statistical analysis to show if the correlations are significant. In addition, a positive correlation between ASD and behavioral addiction is observed in the presence of comorbid mental health conditions in many of the studies. Further research with proper controls and statistical analysis is needed to determine whether the development of behavioral addiction is directly influenced by ASD or if the presence of a comorbid mental health condition is the true cause. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Behavioral Theories and Motivational Features Underlying eHealth Interventions for Adolescent Antiretroviral Adherence: Systematic Review
IS  - 12
VL  - 9
AB  - Background: eHealth systems provide new opportunities for the delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence interventions for adolescents. They may be more effective if grounded in health behavior theories and behavior change techniques (BCTs). Prior reviews have examined the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of these eHealth systems. However, studies have not systematically explored the use of health behavior theories and BCTs in the design of these applications. Objective: The purpose of this review was to explore whether health behavior theories and BCTs were considered to ground designs of eHealth systems supporting adolescents' (10-24 years) ART adherence. More specifically, we examined which specific theories and BCTs were applied, and how these BCTs were implemented as design features. Additionally, we investigated the quality and effect of eHealth systems. Methods: A systematic search was performed on IEEE Xplore, ACM, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from 2000 to 2020. Theory use and BCTs were coded using the Theory Coding Scheme and the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1), respectively. Design features were identified using the lenses of motivational design for mobile health (mHealth). The number of BCTs and design features for each eHealth system and their prevalence across all systems were assessed. Results: This review identified 16 eHealth systems aiming to support ART adherence among adolescents. System types include SMS text message reminders (n=6), phone call reminders (n=3), combined SMS text message and phone call reminders (n=1), electronic adherence monitoring devices (n=3), smartphone apps (n=1), smartphone serious games (n=1), gamified smartphone apps (n=1), leveraging existing social media (n=2), web-based applications (n=1), videoconferencing (n=1), and desktop applications (n=1). Nine were grounded in theory, of which 3 used theories extensively. The impact of adolescent developmental changes on ART adherence was not made explicit. A total of 42 different BCTs and 24 motivational design features were used across systems. Ten systems reported positive effects on 1 or more outcomes; however, of these ten systems, only 3 reported exclusively positive effects on all the outcomes they measured. As much as 6 out of 16 reported purely no effect in all the outcomes measured. Conclusions: Basic applications (SMS text messaging and phone calls) were most frequent, although more advanced systems such as mobile apps and games are also emerging. This review indicated gaps in the use of theory and BCTs, and particularly the impact of developmental changes on ART adherence was not adequately considered. Together with adopting a developmental orientation, future eHealth systems should effectively leverage health theories and consider developing more advanced systems that open the door to using BCTs more comprehensively. Overall, the impact of eHealth systems on adolescent ART adherence and its mediators is promising, but conclusive evidence on effect still needs to be provided. © Alemitu Mequanint Bezabih, Kathrin Gerling, Workeabeba Abebe, Vero Vanden Abeele.

TI  - “Better Dead than a Damsel”: Gender Representation and Player Churn
AB  - Gender representation in games is an important consideration at least in part due to its pervasiveness, from toxicity shown towards both non-male players and non-male people that work in the industry, to the sexualisation of characters and persistence of tropes like the damsel in distress. Player churn is an important concept for industry as it shows disengagement from the product and can cause the developer to lose income, such as through lost microtransaction revenue, and cause higher acquisition costs to replace the lost players. Despite the first male protagonist appearing on screens in 1968, it took until 1996 for the first female protagonist to be developed in the form of Lara Croft and, despite progress, gender representation in games still has room for improvement. To critically assess and analyse this issue, this paper explores a history of damsels, design of protagonists, gender identity and cultivation theory. To contribute towards the literature on player churn and gender representation, this paper investigated player churn through protagonist gender. A Brunner-Munzel test was conducted to compare the gender of the protagonist (males or non-males) of 48 games with player churn. Gender was identified through either self-identification of the protagonist in-game, or through pronouns used by other characters when referring to them. Player churn was identified as the difference in daily players playing the game averaged over the first 7 days from the release of a game, days 30-37 from release and days 90-97 from release. This data was acquired from SteamDB, which records daily players of games that are played through the Steam client. Whilst no significant difference was found after either 30-37 days or 90-97 days between the two conditions, within the games investigated, those with a male protagonist generally attracted higher initial playerbases and also saw a steeper drop off in these players after both 30-37 days and 90-97 days. Whilst this could indicate that, despite not attracting as many players initially, games with non-male protagonists attract a more loyal playerbase. These results show that investigation of player churn in this way shows promise to quantifying gender representation.

TI  - Beyond googling: The ethics of using patients’ electronic footprints in psychiatric practice
IS  - 4
VL  - 25
AB  - Electronic communications are an increasingly important part of people’s lives, and much information is accessible through such means. Anecdotal clinical reports indicate that mental health professionals are beginning to use information from their patients’ electronic activities in treatment and that their data-gathering practices have gone far beyond simply searching for patients online. Both academic and private sector researchers are developing mental health applications to collect patient information for clinical purposes. Professional societies and commentators have provided minimal guidance, however, about best practices for obtaining or using information fromelectronic communications or other online activities. This article reviews the clinical and ethical issues regarding use of patients’ electronic activities, primarily focusing on situations in which patients share information with clinicians voluntarily.We discuss the potential uses of mental health patients’ electronic footprints for therapeutic purposes, and consider both the potential benefits and the drawbacks and risks. Whether clinicians decide to use such information in treating any particular patient—and if so, the nature and scope of its use—requires case-by-case analysis. But it is reasonable to assume that clinicians, depending on their circumstances and goals, will encounter circumstances in which patients’ electronic activities will be relevant to, and useful in, treatment. © 2017 President and Fellows of Harvard College.

TI  - Big pharma and health gare: Unsolvable conflict of interests between private enterprise and public health
IS  - 2
VL  - 45
AB  - A landmark paper on Game Theory showed that individual maximization of profit necessarily endangers the public good, and since the problem has no technical solution, "it requires a fundamental extension in morality" (1). We propose here that public health, as a public good, now emerges as a grave example of this problem. Recent events and reports increasingly suggest misalignment between the interests of the pharmaceutical industry and those of public health. Johnson & Johnson illegally and effectively promoted Propulsid off-label for children despite internal company documents raising safety concerns. Death in drug trial has been described as a "trade secret." On Vioxx, Topol wrote: "Sadly, it is clear that Merck's commercial interest exceeded its concern about the drug's toxicity" (2). More and more concerns are raised by scholars and major journal editors about the type and the quality of published evidence, often biased towards efficacy of new products. The industry, funding over 80% of trials, sets up a research agenda guided more by marketing than by clinical considerations. Smart statistical and epidemiological tactics help obtain the desired results. Budget for marketing is by far greater than for research. Massive advertising to physicians and to the public gets increasingly sophisticated: ghost writing, professional guidelines, targeting of consumer groups and manipulating media for disease mongering. Pervasive lobbying and political ties limit the independence of regulatory bodies. Obligation to shareholders overriding public health considerations is not unique to the pharmaceutical industry. The chemical, tobacco and food industries share similar tactics: proclaiming doubts about safety issues, buying researchers, infiltrating universities, boards, media and legislative agencies. By contrast, powerful and cheap health promoting activities, poorly supported by industry because they are too cheap and not patented, are markedly underutilized: technologies for changing behavior (e.g., cardiac rehabilitation), palliative care and use of old, effective and safe drugs - all could benefit from industry's tools of marketing and quality. As those most affected are the sick, the poor and the least educated, free market successes appear to pose unsolvable challenges to social justice in public health.

TI  - Blood pressure reactivity to psychological stress and coronary calcification in the coronary artery risk development in young adults study
IS  - 3
VL  - 47
AB  - A longstanding hypothesis is that individuals who exhibit large increases in blood pressure during psychological stress are at risk for atherosclerosis. We tested whether blood pressure changes during psychological stress predict subsequent coronary calcification (CaC) in young healthy adults. We evaluated 2816 healthy black and white women, 20 to 35 years of age, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, who were not using medication for hypertension or diabetes in 1987-1988. Participants completed video game and star tracing tasks while their blood pressure was recorded. Thirteen years later (2000-2001), they completed computed tomography measures of CaC. Overall 9.3% (261 of 2816) had CaC present at follow-up. Each 10 mm Hg change in systolic blood pressure during the video game was associated with a 24% increased odds of having CaC at follow-up (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.46; P=0.008). This association persisted after adjustment for age, race, sex, education, smoking, alcohol, family history of myocardial infarction, smoking, daily alcohol consumption, body mass index, and resting or baseline blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.58; P=0.006). Blood pressure changes during the star tracing task were not associated with subsequent CaC. Blood pressure changes during a video game predicted the presence of CaC 13 years later. To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports blood pressure reactivity to a stressor being related to calcification in the coronary arteries. Blood pressure reactivity may provide useful prognostic information about future risk beyond standard risk factors. © 2006 American Heart Association, Inc.

TI  - Body Movement Reduces Pain Intensity in Virtual Reality–Based Analgesia
IS  - 11
VL  - 34
AB  - In this study we investigated the relationship between body movement during virtual reality (VR) analgesia and the experience of pain. Thermal (cold) stimulation was used to inflict pain. Two measures of pain were used—pain tolerance and pain intensity. Participants were wearing head mounted displays (Oculus Rift DK2) and were playing a game created by authors of the study. Forty-six students of Wroclaw University participated in a within-subject design experiment. Each subject participated in a non-VR control condition and in two experimental conditions. Participants navigated the VR game using a computer mouse, but the mouse sensitivity (and therefore amount of physical movement necessary to navigate) was different in each experimental condition. We also measured feeling of presence in VR, game behavior, and attitudes toward the game. The amount of body movement while steering the game was related to a decrease in pain intensity, but not in pain tolerance. This was an opposite result to our previously published experiment where we found an effect on pain tolerance but not on sensitivity. There was no significant correlation between presence and any of the pain measures. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Brain Health Indicators Following Acute Neuro-Exergaming: Biomarker and Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) after Pedal-n-Play (iPACES)
IS  - 6
VL  - 13
AB  - Facing an unrelenting rise in dementia cases worldwide, researchers are exploring non-pharmacological ways to ameliorate cognitive decline in later life. Twenty older adults completed assessments before and after a single bout of interactive physical and cognitive exercise, by playing a neuro-exergame that required pedaling and steering to control progress in a tablet-based video game tailored to impact executive function (the interactive Physical and Cognitive Exercise System; iPACES v2). This study explored the cognitive and biomarker outcomes for participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normative older adults after 20 min of pedal-to-play exercise. Neuropsychological and salivary assessments were performed pre- and post-exercise to assess the impact. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed significant interaction effects, with MCI participants experiencing greater changes in executive function and alpha-amylase levels than normative older adults; within-group changes were also significant. This study provides further data regarding cognitive effects and potential mechanisms of action for exercise as an intervention for MCI. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Breathing as an Input Modality in a Gameful Breathing Training App
(Breeze 2): Development and Evaluation Study
IS  - 3
VL  - 10
AB  - Background: Slow-paced breathing training can have positive effects on
physiological and psychological well-being. Unfortunately, use
statistics indicate that adherence to breathing training apps is low.
Recent work suggests that gameful breathing training may help overcome
this challenge.
Objective: This study aimed to introduce and evaluate the gameful
breathing training app Breeze 2 and its novel real-time breathing
detection algorithm that enables the interactive components of the app.
Methods: We developed the breathing detection algorithm by using deep
transfer learning to detect inhalation, exhalation, and nonbreathing
sounds (including silence). An additional heuristic prolongs detected
exhalations to stabilize the algorithm's predictions. We evaluated
Breeze 2 with 30 participants (women: n=14, 47\%; age: mean 29.77, SD
7.33 years). Participants performed breathing training with Breeze 2 in
2 sessions with and without headphones. They answered questions
regarding user engagement (User Engagement Scale Short Form {[}UES-SF]),
perceived effectiveness (PE), perceived relaxation effectiveness, and
perceived breathing detection accuracy. We used Wilcoxon signed-rank
tests to compare the UES-SF, PE, and perceived relaxation effectiveness
scores with neutral scores. Furthermore, we correlated perceived
breathing detection accuracy with actual multi-class balanced accuracy
to determine whether participants could perceive the actual breathing
detection performance. We also conducted a repeated-measure ANOVA to
investigate breathing detection differences in balanced accuracy with
and without the heuristic and when classifying data captured from
headphones and smartphone microphones. The analysis controlled for
potential between-subject effects of the participants' sex.
Results: Our results show scores that were significantly higher than
neutral scores for the UES-SF (W=459; P<.001), PE (W=465; P<.001), and
perceived relaxation effectiveness (W=358; P<.001). Perceived breathing
detection accuracy correlated significantly with the actual multi-class
balanced accuracy (r=0.51; P<.001). Furthermore, we found that the
heuristic significantly improved the breathing detection balanced
accuracy (F-1,(25)=6.23; P=.02) and that detection performed better on
data captured from smartphone microphones than than on data from
headphones (F-1,F-25=17.61; P<.001). We did not observe any significant
between-subject effects of sex. Breathing detection without the
heuristic reached a multi-class balanced accuracy of 74\% on the
collected audio recordings.
Conclusions: Most participants (28/30, 93\%) perceived Breeze 2 as
engaging and effective. Furthermore, breathing detection worked well for
most participants, as indicated by the perceived detection accuracy and
actual detection accuracy. In future work, we aim to use the collected
breathing sounds to improve breathing detection with regard to its
stability and performance. We also plan to use Breeze 2 as an
intervention tool in various studies targeting the prevention and
management of noncommunicable diseases.

TI  - Broadband internet, digital temptations, and sleep
VL  - 153
AB  - There is a growing concern that the widespread use of computers, mobile phones and other digital devices before bedtime disrupts our sleep with detrimental effects on our health and cognitive performance. High-speed Internet promotes the use of electronic devices, video games and Internet addiction (e.g., online games and cyberloafing). Exposure to artificial light from tablets and PCs can alterate individuals’ sleep patterns. However, there is little empirical evidence on the causal relationship between technology use near bedtime and sleep. This paper studies the causal effects of access to high-speed Internet on sleep. We first show that playing video games, using PC or smartphones, watching TV or movies are correlated with shorter sleep duration. Second, we exploit historical differences in pre-existing telephone infrastructure that affected the deployment of high-speed Internet across Germany (see Falck et al., 2014) to identify a source of plausibly exogenous variation in access to Broadband. Using this instrumental variable strategy, we find that access to high-speed Internet (DSL) access reduces sleep duration and sleep satisfaction. Results are driven by individuals who face work or family time constraints. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Can blockchain help food supply chains with platform operations during the COVID-19 outbreak?
VL  - 49
AB  - Food selling platforms are facing both challenges and opportunities during the COVID-19 outbreak as the enforcement of social distancing protocols has pushed consumers with serious health and safety concerns to shop online. Observing that platforms and their suppliers have adopted blockchain technologies and linked selected information nodes separately to foster consumers’ trust, we establish a game-theoretic model to study the operations decisions and blockchain adoption strategies for a food supply chain consisting of one platform and one supplier. We explore the values and impacts of blockchain on the retailing platform, supplier, and consumers, respectively. An all-win situation is achieved when both members of the supply chain adopt blockchain. We further propose that not all prevalent supply chain contracts can achieve supply chain coordination in the presence of blockchain. In extended studies, we examine the incentives of the supply chain members’ blockchain implementation with consideration of the fixed cost of such adoption, product infection, and tampered information. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Cell phone cinema: Latin American horror flicks in the post-digital age
IS  - 3
VL  - 53
AB  - Cell phone cinema is an emergent phenomenon well-suited for Latin American independent filmmakers. With technology that is simple to operate and low production costs, as well as open and free distribution via online streaming, cell phone cinema has arguably democratized access to filmmaking. But even as alternative production and distribution avenues liberate filmmakers, they also limit artistic potential and marginalize their films as the work of amateurs. Since cell phone cinema's arrival in the early 2000s, filmmakers have wrestled with a paradox: they have embraced the making of films that are low-budget, transgressive, and independent, even as they strive for a higher production quality to compete with commercial cinema. Efforts to reconcile these seemingly opposing tendencies have profound repercussions on the content and aesthetics of cell phone films-works that are made close-to-the-body and are increasingly hybrid (combining digital and analog elements), characteristic of a post-digital aesthetic of glitch. This essay defines the features of global cell phone cinema and presents an overview of the format. Then, turning to Latin America, it studies three paradigmatic cell phone horror flicks, a genre with a significant presence in mobile filmmaking. Several critical questions are raised: are we experiencing a cinematic format that will change the game, from a cinema made and distributed by the commercial industry to self-produced films created by autodidacts and distributed freely online? Or will these films be co-opted by market forces? I argue that whatever the future of this new format, the Latin American independent film landscape has already been significantly altered by cell phone technologies. © 2019 Washington University in St. Louis.

AB  - Introduction: TikTok is a digital native social network that has managed to generate interest among teenagers through which they share their audiovisual productions from mobile devices, but what type of content do teenagers create and disseminate on this application? We address this issue to find out the type of videos that Spanish and British teenage tiktokers are uploading to this social network. Methodology: Using content analysis methodology, 447 videos from 12 British and 12 Spanish tiktokers aged between 11 and 17 with more than half a million followers are studied. It provides analysis by nationality and a comparative view of both nationalities. Results: Contents created and disseminated by both genders and nationalities are video-selfies, choreographies, and videos with a fun purpose. Results show 16 and 17-year-old are the most active on this social network. Spanish and British teenagers create and disseminate videos with similar content. They show is age, not gender, determining variable for their digital productions. It is observed boys abandon video games to give way to a more protagonist self-representation in this social network. Discussion and conclusions: There is a lack of plurality in the type of content created and disseminated on TikTok by both genders and nationalities. It is interesting to note the attenuation of the traditional gender roles that teenagers show in their audio-visual productions on TikTok, which reflect the possible gender-related development into their behavior on social networks. © 2021, University of La Laguna.

TI  - Challenges in diagnosis: exploring comorbidities and differential diagnosis in a young adult with mild autism spectrum disorder and attenuated psychosis syndrome
IS  - 1-2
VL  - 29
AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, and its relationship with schizophrenia has been studied since the early 20th century. Several studies have shown a high prevalence of psychotic episodes in ASD, leading many authors to hypothesize that patients with neurodevelopmental disorders may have a substantial vulnerability to psychosis. In this paper, the authors describe the clinical case of a 19-year-old male showing social withdrawal and subthreshold persecutory ideas undergoing his first psychiatric evaluation. The patient´s psychomotor development was unremarkable except for a slight speech delay. He has always exhibited introverted tendencies and became increasingly reserved during adolescence. Today, he experiences significant anxiety around his peers and prefers remaining indoors, spending most of the time playing on his smartphone or online games. The diagnostic challenge for clinicians lies in distinguishing between co-occurring disorders or determining whether the clinical manifestations are solely due to one of the conditions. © Copyright by Pacini Editore Srl.

TI  - Challenges of Designing Consent: Consent Mechanics in Video Games as Models for Interactive User Agency
AB  - This paper argues for a conceptual framework that treats user consent in interactive technologies as a design challenge necessitating careful, culturally-informed consideration. We draw on recent work in HCI as well as queer and feminist theory that understands consent as rooted in negotiating agency in order to frame our exploration of unique difficulties and potential solutions to meaningful opportunities for user consent in the design of computational technologies. Through a critical analysis of three video games that offer different models of consent-each of which communicates different values through its design-we introduce the concept of consent mechanics. Consent mechanics describe designed interactions that allow players to consent to or opt out of in-game experiences, often those related to sexuality or intimacy. Here, we approach video games as windows onto design considerations surrounding interactive technologies more broadly, suggesting crucial questions and tactics for how to design user agency ethically into computational systems.

TI  - Challenging AI: Evaluating the Effect of MCTS-Driven Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment on Player Enjoyment
AB  - Providing a challenging Artificial Intelligent opponent is an important aspect of making video games enjoyable and immersive. A game that is too easy, or conversely too hard may frustrate or bore players. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment is a method that aims at improving the traditional methods of difficulty selection, by providing an opponent that tailors the challenge it presents to players such that it is at an optimal level for them. This research presents a player evaluation of three different Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment approaches using Monte Carlo Tree Search and measures their impact on player enjoyment, realism and perceived level of difficulty. In particular, it investigates the effect that different win/loss ratios, employed by Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment, have on player enjoyment.

TI  - Changes in user experience and satisfaction as media technology evolves: The reciprocal relationship between video games and video game-related media
VL  - 174
AB  - In video game market, there have been diverse user-generated contents related to game information. Users, therefore, can obtain game-related information not only from traditional mass media such as television or radio but also from interpersonal communication media (e.g., social network services) and masspersonal communication media (e.g., real-time streaming services). The purpose of this study is to investigate factors affecting attitudes toward content itself as well as toward alternative media that provide content, and to investigate the moderating effects of different communication types. We predict a complementary relationship between video game and video game-related media using a structural equation model reflecting joint effects between different media. Online communities in interpersonal communication have positive effects on attitudes toward video games and video game-related media due to active interactions among users and the usefulness of shared information. In this study, we confirmed that attitudes toward online communities positively affect actual intentions to play video games, thus indicating that there is complementarity between video games and online communities. © 2021

TI  - Changes Over Time and Predictors of Online Gambling in Three Norwegian Population Studies 2013–2019
VL  - 12
AB  - Objectives: To investigate changes over time and identify predictors of online gambling among gamblers by using three Norwegian representative samples covering a 6-year (2013–2019) period. We also aimed to identify different characteristics (including video game participation and video gaming problems) of online compared to offline gamblers. Methods: Data from gamblers (N = 15,096) participating in three cross-sectional surveys (2013, 2015, and 2019) based on random sampling from the Norwegian Population Registry were analyzed. Participants were asked how frequently they engaged in online gambling on different platforms (e.g., mobile phone). Data on sociodemographics, games gambled, gambling problems, gaming, and problem gaming were collected and analyzed by logistic regression analyses. Results: Overall, an increase in online gambling from 2013 to 2015 was found (a larger percentage of gamblers reported having gambled online at least once during the last year), and an increase in online gambling from 2015 to 2019 was found (more gamblers reported having gambled online at least once last year and at least once per week). The increase was largest for gambling on mobile phone. Consistent predictors of online gambling (at least once last year and at least once per week) were male gender, high income, being unemployed, being on disability pension, having work assessment allowance, being a homemaker or retiree, number of games gambled, and gambling problems. Conclusions: Online gambling, especially on mobile phones, has increased significantly during the last 6 years in Norway. Hence, gambling availability seems to have grown, which may pose a risk for development of gambling problems. Compared to offline gamblers, online gamblers were more likely to be men, young, not working or studying, gambling on several games, and having gambling problems. Responsible gambling efforts aiming at preventing or minimizing harm related to online gambling should thus target these groups. © Copyright © 2021 Pallesen, Mentzoni, Morken, Engebø, Kaur and Erevik.

TI  - Character play: the use of game characters in multi-player role-playing games across platforms
IS  - 2
VL  - 6
AB  - Avatars are a commonly used mechanism for representing the player within the world of a game. The avatar forms the main point of interaction between the player and the game, and thus the avatar is an important game design feature. Character-based games combine the concept of an avatar with that of a character, enhancing the avatar with specific features that commonly are changeable, and which can be defined within or outside the framework of the game rules. Within digital games, the rules-based features have received comparatively more attention than, for example, the personalities and background histories of game characters. This article presents results from a comprehensive empirical study of the way complex game characters are utilized by players in multiplayer role-playing games across two different media platforms. The results indicate that adult players are capable of comprehending and utilizing game characters with well-defined personalities and backgrounds, as well as rules-based components. Furthermore, that the game format plays a significant role in the pattern of usage of the character elements. This pattern appears directly linked with variations in the way that the different game formats handle player characters and activate or promote the activation of, different forms of character elements. The degree to which different character elements are activated also has implications for the degree of player engagement in the character.

TI  - Cheating for problem solving: a genetic algorithm with social interactions
AB  - We propose a variation of the standard genetic algorithm that incorporates social interaction between the individuals in the population. Our goal is to understand the evolutionary role of social systems and its possible application as a non-genetic new step in evolutionary algorithms. In biological populations, i.e. animals, even human beings and microorganisms, social interactions often affect the fitness of individuals. It is conceivable that the perturbation of the fitness via social interactions is an evolutionary strategy to avoid trapping into local optimum, thus avoiding a fast convergence of the population. We model the social interactions according to Game Theory. The population is, therefore, composed by cooperator and defector individuals whose interactions produce payoffs according to well known game models (prisoner's dilemma, chicken game, and others). Our results on Knapsack problems show, for some game models, a significant performance improvement as compared to a standard genetic algorithm.

TI  - Cheer for me: effect of non-player character audience feedback on older adult users of virtual reality exergames
IS  - 3
VL  - 27
AB  - The presence of an audience and its feedback could affect people’s performance and experience during an event, especially related to sports such as tennis or boxing. Similarly, in videogames, players’ gameplay could be affected if there is an audience and its feedback in response to players’ performance in the environment. The inclusion of an audience with non-player characters (NPC) is common in videogames in general. However, there is a limited exploration of the use of an NPC audience in virtual reality (VR) exergames, especially focusing on elderly players. To fill this gap, this work examines the effect of an NPC audience and its associated feedback (with/without) on elderly users of VR exergames. In a user study, we used 120 NPC in a virtual audience. Results showed that the presence of the NPC audience with responsive feedback led to higher performance (with a higher success rate of performing gesture actions, more successful combinations of actions (or combos for short) performed, and more opponent’s combos prevented) and better gameplay experience (with higher levels of competence, autonomy, relatedness, immersion, and intuitive controls) of elderly players. Our results can help frame the design and engineering of VR exergames that are targeted at elderly users to help them have an enhanced gameplay experience and improve their health. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - C-Hg: A Collaborative Haptic-Gripper Fine Motor Skill Training System for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
IS  - 2
VL  - 14
AB  - Computer-assisted systems can provide efficient and engaging ASD intervention environments for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, most existing computer-assisted systems target only one skill deficit (e.g., social conversation skills) and ignore the importance of other areas, such as motor skills, that could also impact social interaction. This focus on a single domain may hinder the generalizability of learned skills to real-world scenarios, because the targeted teaching strategies do not reflect that real-world tasks often involve more than one skill domain. The work presented in this article seeks to bridge this gap by developing a Collaborative Haptic-gripper virtual skill training system (C-Hg). This system includes individual and collaborative games that provide opportunities for simultaneously practicing both fine motor skills (hand movement and grip control skills) as well as social skills (communication and collaboration) and investigating how they relate to each other. We conducted a usability study with 10 children with ASD and 10 Typically Developing (TD) children (8–12 years), who used C-Hg to play a series of individual and collaborative games requiring differing levels of motor and communication skill. Results revealed that participant performance significantly improved in both individual and collaborative fine motor skill training tasks, including significant improvements in collaborative manipulations between partners. Participants with ASD were found to conduct more collaborative manipulations and initiate more conversations with their partners in the post collaborative tasks, suggesting more active collaboration and communication of participants with ASD in the collaborative tasks. Results support the potential of our C-Hg system for simultaneously improving fine motor and social skills, with implications for impacts of improved fine motor skills on social outcomes.

TI  - Children’s Doctor Games and Nudity at Danish Childcare Institutions
IS  - 4
VL  - 47
AB  - This article presents the first Danish study of the acceptance of children’s nudity and sexuality at Danish childcare institutions. The study revealed an important cultural shift in the attitude toward children’s nudity and sexual games, the so-called doctor games. Although these were quite accepted at Danish childcare institutions until the beginning of this century, the study showed that new, pervasive regulations had been established to control the child’s body and its sexuality. A new discourse revealed that fear of child sexual abuse, in particular, had influenced views of children’s sexual games and nudity and that, at times, the child itself was viewed as a potential threat to other children. This marks a new development in Denmark, internationally known for its broadmindedness, and this article discusses the background to this cultural shift in the institutions, and possible implications for the children. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Clinical evaluations and collaborative design: developing new technologies for mental healthcare interventions
AB  - Ethical requirements, severe constraints on access to end users and the necessity of real-world clinical evaluations represent significant challenges to designers of new technologies in mental healthcare (MHC) settings. This paper describes the collaborative approaches, incorporating HCI methods with input for MHC professionals and MHC theory, which were applied in the development of Personal Investigator (PI), a 3D computer game developed to support adolescent mental health interventions. Different stages in the evaluation of PI are discussed and the lessons learned through a multi-site clinical evaluation are presented. This evaluation has provided strong initial evidence that games such as PI offer the potential to improve adolescent engagement in talk-based interventions. It has also provided an insight into factors which should be considered in future designs in the MHC domain, e.g. the need to incorporate high levels of adaptability in future systems. Based on the difficulties encountered and lessons learned critical aims for future research are outlined.

TI  - Combining postgraduate research training, public engagement, and primary
school science education-a Superbugs Master (MSc) class
VL  - 15
AB  - Since 2018, the `Superbugs' initiative at Cardiff University (United
Kingdom) has been delivering projects that take a research-driven
approach to public engagement, involving rigorous evaluation of the
methodologies of delivery and the mechanics of communication. The
overall aim of Superbugs is to raise awareness and improve public
knowledge of microbiology, infection and antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
In the present project, four postgraduate students were recruited to
undertake research projects as part of their Master of Science (MSc)
studies. After a period of literature appraisals, the students chose to
focus on the topic of personal and food hygiene and were tasked with
collecting information on effective strategies for educating young
children. Taking advantage of a focus group of primary school teachers,
the students then designed evidence-informed educational activities and
the evaluation strategies by which the impact of these would be
assessed. A pilot delivery of these activities was carried out in a
community setting at a local public library, before final delivery as
part of a school outreach workshop. The MSc students produced three new
elements of educational material; a story book, a treasure hunt and an
interactive card game, primarily built around the concepts of challenge
and gamification. Feedback collected from primary school pupils aged 6-7
years old and teachers indicated that the activities developed were
successful in both being engaging to young people and resulting in an
improved knowledge on the chosen topics. Taken together, we present
evidence that postgraduate research training, underpinned by active and
service learning, represents a valid and effective way of delivering
impactful public engagement. In turn, the experience holds benefit for
the students not only in terms of their academic study and core
scientific skills, but also their wider appreciation and confidence in
being effective engagers and science communicators.

TI  - Comparison of Breast-feeding Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs Before
and After Educational Intervention for Rural Appalachian High School
Students
IS  - 3
VL  - 106
AB  - Objectives: Breast-feeding rates in rural and southeastern regions of
the United States are lower than national rates and Healthy People 2020
targets. The objectives of this study were to understand current
breast-feeding knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs among rural southern
Appalachian adolescents and to explore whether a high school educational
intervention designed to address the five tenets (knowledge, attitudes,
intentions, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms) of the
theory of planned behavior may be effective in increasing future rates
of breast-feeding in this population.
Methods: An educational session including an interactive game was
developed and administered to occupational health science students
during a single class period in two county high schools. A presurvey and
a postsurvey administered 2 weeks after the intervention were completed
by students. Pre- and postsurveys were analyzed using paired t tests and
Cohen d and potential differences based on sex and grade were explored.
Results: Both pre- and postsurveys were completed by 107 students
(78\%). Knowledge, attitudes about breast-feeding benefits, subjective
norms, and intentions significantly improved following the intervention.
Baseline knowledge and attitudes about breast-feeding benefits for
mothers were low and demonstrated the greatest improvement.
Conclusions: Offering breast-feeding education based on the theory of
planned behavior in a single high school class session was effective in
improving student knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about breastfeeding
and intention to breast-feed.

TI  - Computer-Based Development of Reading Skills to Reduce Dropout in Uncertain Times
IS  - 4
VL  - 10
AB  - An adequate level of reading comprehension is a prerequisite for successful learning. Numerous studies have shown that without a solid foundation, there can be severe difficulties in later learning and that failure in the first years of schooling can determine attitudes to learning. In the present study, we present the effect size of an online game-based training program implemented on eDia. The primary goals of the development program are to develop fluency in reading and reading comprehension in Grades 3–4. The content of the program has been developed in accordance with the national core curriculum and the textbooks based on it. Therefore, it can be integrated into both classroom-based lessons and extracurricular activities outside of class. The quasiexperimental research involved 276 students. Propensity score matching was used in examining the effect size of the development program to increase the validity of the results. Through the training program, the development of students in the intervention group accelerated greatly (d =.51), which proved to be even higher in the lowest and average skill groups (d1 = 1.81; d2 =.92) as well as in the disadvantaged student group (d =.72). Latent-change analyses confirmed the sensitivity, relevance, and importance of developing comprehension at 9–10 years of age and the generalizability of the results (χ2 = 421.5; df = 272; p <.05; CFI =.950; TLI =.945; RMSEA =.045 (CI:.036,.153). The study provided evidence that a well-designed online training program is suitable for developing comprehension and overcoming disadvantages, even without the presence of the teacher outside the classroom. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Concussion Characteristics and Early Postinjury Outcomes Between College Students and Intercollegiate Athletes
IS  - 2
VL  - 103
AB  - Objective: To describe concussion characteristics among general college students and compare postinjury outcomes to intercollegiate student athletes. Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: Large university in the Southeast region of the United States. Participants: A total of 179 (N=179) college students’ (female=120; 67.0%; 23.9±3.9 years) and 49 athletes’ (female=28, 57.1%;19.3±1.3 years) medical records were examined. Participants self-reported injury mechanism, health history information, and completed clinical assessments acutely (<7 days postinjury). Main Outcome Measures: Descriptive statistics were calculated for each group. Concussion outcomes between students with and without certain health history diagnoses were assessed using separate t tests. We conducted univariate regression analyses to determine if sex, age, and time from concussion to first clinical assessment were significant predictors of clinical outcomes. Statistically significant variables were included as covariates in a series of 1-way analyses of covariance to identify differences in balance, symptom severity, total symptom presence, and neurocognitive domain performance between students and athletes. Fisher exact tests were used to compare health history information between groups (α<0.05). Results: Among students, 24% reported sustaining a concussion while participating in recreational sports, and 27% of impacts occurred to the back of the head. Students had higher proportions of headache, migraine, anxiety, and depression (P<.05). Students reported greater total symptom presence (P=.006) and performed worse on the computerized neurocognitive test domain score for complex attention (P=.015) relative to athletes. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for better access to medical care for non– National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctioned athletes because of a large proportion of concussions in the student sample being sustained during sports participation. Identifying common injury mechanisms can provide clinicians with powerful information to improve evaluation and treatment models. © 2021

TI  - Concussion Nondisclosure in Youth Sports
IS  - 7
VL  - 57
AB  - Context: Researchers conducting studies about sport-related concussion (SRC) reporting behaviors and reasons for nondisclosure primarily focus on older athletic populations. Youth athletes participating in contact sports are also at risk for SRC; however, little is known about their SRC disclosure patterns and reasons for nondisclosure. Objective: To examine the self-reported SRC history and reasons for SRC nondisclosure of youth athletes aged 8-14 years. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Youth athletes in organized football, ice hockey, lacrosse, or soccer. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 411 youth athletes (boys = 70.0% [n = 287/410]; median age = 11 [interquartile range = 10-13] years). Main Outcome Measure(s): A 15-minute survey including self-reported demographics, diagnosed and nondisclosed SRC history, and reasons for nondisclosure of suspected SRCs. Results: Ten percent of respondents (n = 41/411) recounted ≥ 1 diagnosed SRC, 12.7% (n = 52/411) did not report a suspected SRC, 13.1% (n = 53/404) indicated they continued to practice, and 12.3% (n=50/406) reported they continued to play in a game after a suspected SRC. Significant associations between sport and nondisclosure existed (P values < .001) but not with self-reported concussion history (P = .14). In sexcomparable analyses, boys' lacrosse players had a higher frequency of nondisclosure than girls (P = .05). The most common reasons for nondisclosure were not wanting to lose playing time (66.7%, n = 32/48), miss a game (56.3%, n = 27/ 48), and let the team down (43.8%, n = 21/48) and uncertainty over injury severity and the presence of SRC (43.8%, n=21/48). Conclusions: Ten percent of youth athletes self-reported at least 1 diagnosed SRC. However, they also described continuing to practice or play in a game after a suspected SRC. Reasons for nondisclosure at this age were similar to those reported in high school and collegiate athletes. Recent researchers suggested negative consequences of continued play with SRC, especially in the acute stages. Anyone conducting future educational initiatives should emphasize these risks and focus on reasons why athletes of both sexes withhold reporting. © 2022 National Athletic Trainers' Association Inc..

TI  - Conducting real-time multiplayer experiments on the web
IS  - 4
VL  - 47
AB  - Group behavior experiments require potentially large numbers of participants to interact in real time with perfect information about one another. In this paper, we address the methodological challenge of developing and conducting such experiments on the web, thereby broadening access to online labor markets as well as allowing for participation through mobile devices. In particular, we combine a set of recent web development technologies, including Node.js with the Socket.io module, HTML5 canvas, and jQuery, to provide a secure platform for pedagogical demonstrations and scalable, unsupervised experiment administration. Template code is provided for an example real-time behavioral game theory experiment which automatically pairs participants into dyads and places them into a virtual world. In total, this treatment is intended to allow those with a background in non-web-based programming to modify the template, which handles the technical server–client networking details, for their own experiments. © 2014, Psychonomic Society, Inc.

TI  - Control-Alt-Hack: the design and evaluation of a card game for computer security awareness and education
AB  - We scoped, designed, produced, and evaluated the effectiveness of a recreational tabletop card game created to raise awareness of and alter perceptions regarding-computer security. We discuss our process, the challenges that arose, and the decisions we made to address those challenges. As of May 2013, we have shipped approximately 800 free copies to 150 educators. We analyze and report on feedback from 22 of these educators about their experiences using Control-Alt-Hack with over 450 students in classroom and non-classroom contexts. The responses from the 14 educators who reported on their use of the game in a classroom context variously indicated that: their students' awareness of computer security as a complex and interesting field was increased (11/14); they would use the game again in their classroom (10/14); and they would recommend the game to others (13/14). Of note, 2 of the 14 classroom educators reported that they would not have otherwise covered the material. Additionally, we present results from user studies with 11 individuals and find that their responses indicate that 8 of the 11 had an increased awareness of computer security or a changed perception; furthermore, all of our intended goals are touched upon in their responses.

TI  - Coupled simultaneous analysis of vaccine and self-awareness strategies on evolutionary dilemma aspect with various immunity
IS  - 3
VL  - 9
AB  - On evolutionary game theory (EGT), two intervention policies: vaccination and self-awareness, are considered to account for how human attitude impacts disease spreading. Although these interventions can impose, their implementation may depend on the various immunity systems such as shield immunity, innate immunity, waning immunity, natural immunity, and artificial immunity. This framework provides an epidemic SEIRVA (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-vaccinated-aware) model and two EGT dynamics to analyze the interplay between the immunity system and social learning interventions. The prospect of exploring the individual's strategy and social dilemma for removing a disease could assist design an effective vaccine program and self-awareness policy. Also, we evaluated the indicator of social efficiency deficit (SED) for a social dual-dilemma to measure the presence of a dilemma situation. Extensive theoretical analysis displays that stability includes the reproduction number, conditions for positivity and uniqueness, and the strength number analyzed in the equilibria, including fundamental properties validated by numerical simulation of the discretization method that appraises a variety of graphs at adjusting parameters. We present extensive numerical studies investigating the affect of controlling parameters, individual vulnerability, optimal policies, and individual costs. It turns out that, even with the affordable vaccine, individuals may have very different behaviors; self-awareness strategy plays a vital role in controlling diseases. © 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - COVID-19, Health Habits, and Addictive Behaviors in the General
Population
IS  - 1
VL  - 10
AB  - The lockdown due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had
a significant impact on daily routines and habits. New lifestyle
behaviors contributed to the onset and course of mental diseases,
including addictive problems. The objective of this work was to describe
changes in health status during lockdown in the general population,
including potentially addictive behaviors, and explore possible
contributing factors. The analyzed data comprised a population-based
sample of 240 individuals (73.3\% women, mean age 43.8 years old).
Assessments included sociodemographics and self-reports for health state
and addictive behaviors. The risk of perceived worsening physical and
psychological state was 21.7\% and 20.0\%, respectively, after the
lockdown. The risk of requiring a new treatment for physical and
psychological illnesses was 10.4\% and 4.2\%, respectively, while 2.5\%
of the participants started using illegal drugs and 9\% initiated video
game use. Finally, the statistical predictors of health worsening during
the lockdown were the presence of anxiety symptoms, being unmarried,
having low education levels, experiencing fears related to COVID-19
infection, and having family conflicts. This research identified
vulnerability factors contributing to changes in physic and mental
health, as well as those associated with addictive behaviors during
lockdown. These results should be considered in further stressful
situations to design personalized preventive and therapeutic plans.

TI  - COVID-19-Related Social Isolation Predispose to Problematic Internet and Online Video Gaming Use in Italy
IS  - 3
VL  - 19
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic and its related containment measures have been associated with increased levels of stress, anxiety and depression in the general population. While the use of digital media has been greatly promoted by national governments and international authorities to maintain social contacts and healthy lifestyle behaviors, its increased access may also bear the risk of inappropriate or excessive use of internet-related resources. The present study, part of the COVID Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) study, aims at investigating the possible relationship between social isolation, the use of digital resources and the development of their problematic use. A cross sectional survey was carried out to explore the prevalence of internet addiction, excessive use of social media, problematic video gaming and binge watching, during Italian phase II (May-June 2020) and III (June-September 2020) of the pandemic in 1385 individuals (62.5% female, mean age 32.5 ± 12.9) mainly living in Central Italy (52.4%). Data were stratified according to phase II/III and three groups of Italian regions (northern, central and southern). Compared to the larger COMET study, most participants exhibited significant higher levels of severe-to-extremely-severe depressive symptoms (46.3% vs. 12.4%; p < 0.01) and extremely severe anxiety symptoms (77.8% vs. 7.5%; p < 0.01). We also observed a rise in problematic internet use and excessive gaming over time. Mediation analyses revealed that COVID-19-related general psychopathology, stress, anxiety, depression and social isolation play a significant role in the emergence of problematic internet use, social media addiction and problematic video gaming. Professional gamers and younger subjects emerged as sub-populations particularly at risk of developing digital addictions. If confirmed in larger and more homogenous samples, our findings may help in shedding light on possible preventive and treatment strategies for digital addictions. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Creating a theoretically grounded, gamified health app: Lessons from developing the cigbreak smoking cessation mobile phone game
IS  - 4
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: Gaming techniques are increasingly recognized as effective methods for changing behavior and increasing user engagement with mobile phone apps. The rapid uptake of mobile phone games provides an unprecedented opportunity to reach large numbers of people and to influence a wide range of health-related behaviors. However, digital interventions are still nascent in the field of health care, and optimum gamified methods of achieving health behavior change are still being investigated. There is currently a lack of worked methodologies that app developers and health care professionals can follow to facilitate theoretically informed design of gamified health apps. Objective: This study aimed to present a series of steps undertaken during the development of Cigbreak, a gamified smoking cessation health app. Methods: A systematic and iterative approach was adopted by (1) forming an expert multidisciplinary design team, (2) defining the problem and establishing user preferences, (3) incorporating the evidence base, (4) integrating gamification, (5) adding behavior change techniques, (6) forming a logic model, and (7) user testing. A total of 10 focus groups were conducted with 73 smokers. Results: Users found the app an engaging and motivating way to gain smoking cessation advice and a helpful distraction from smoking; 84% (62/73) of smokers said they would play again and recommend it to a friend. Conclusions: A dedicated gamified app to promote smoking cessation has the potential to modify smoking behavior and to deliver effective smoking cessation advice. Iterative, collaborative development using evidence-based behavior change techniques and gamification may help to make the game engaging and potentially effective. Gamified health apps developed in this way may have the potential to provide effective and low-cost health interventions in a wide range of clinical settings. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.

TI  - Creating a theoretically grounded gaming app to increase adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis: Lessons from the development of the viral combat mobile phone game
IS  - 1
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: In the United States, young minority men who have sex with men (MSM) are most likely to become infected with HIV. The use of antiretroviral medications to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection (pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP) is an efficacious and promising prevention strategy. There have been significant advances regarding PrEP, including the definitive demonstration that PrEP reduces HIV acquisition and the development of clinical prescribing guidelines. Despite these promising events, the practical implementation of PrEP can be challenging. Data show that PrEP's safety and effectiveness could be greatly compromised by suboptimal adherence to treatment, and there is concern about the potential for an increase in HIV risk behavior among PrEP users. Due to these challenges, the prescribing of PrEP should be accompanied by behavioral interventions to promote adherence. Objective: This study aimed to develop an immersive, action-oriented iPhone gaming intervention to improve motivation for adherence to PrEP. Methods: Game development was guided by social learning theory, taking into consideration the perspectives of young adult MSM who are taking PrEP. A total of 20 young men who have sex with men (YMSM; aged 18-35 years) were recruited from a sexually transmitted infection (STI), HIV testing, and PrEP care clinic in Jackson, Mississippi, between October 2016 and June 2017. They participated in qualitative interviews guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model of behavior change. The mean age of participants was 26 years, and all the participants identified as male. Acceptability of the game was assessed with the Client Service Questionnaire and session evaluation form. Results: A number of themes emerged that informed game development. YMSM taking PrEP desired informational game content that included new and comprehensive details about the effectiveness of PrEP, details about PrEP as it relates to doctors' visits, and general information about STIs other than HIV. Motivational themes that emerged were the desire for enhancement of future orientation; reinforcement of positive influences from partners, parents, and friends; collaboration with health care providers; decreasing stigma; and a focus on personal relevance of PrEP-related medical care. Behavioral skills themes centered around self-efficacy and strategies for adherence to PrEP and self-care. Conclusions: We utilized youth feedback, IMB, and agile software development to create a multilevel, immersive, action-oriented iPhone gaming intervention to improve motivation for adherence to PrEP. There is a dearth of gaming interventions for persons on PrEP. This study is a significant step in working toward the development and testing of an iPhone gaming intervention to decrease HIV risk and promote adherence to PrEP for YMSM. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.

TI  - Creating Effective Mobile Phone Apps to Optimize Antiretroviral Therapy
Adherence: Perspectives From Stimulant-Using HIV-Positive Men Who Have
Sex With Men
IS  - 2
VL  - 4
AB  - Background: The use of stimulant drugs among men who have sex with men (
MSM) with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) is associated with
decreased odds of antiretroviral therapy ( ART) adherence and elevated
risk of forward HIV transmission. Advancing tailored and innovative
mobile phone-based ART adherence app interventions for stimulant-using
HIV-positive MSM requires greater understanding of their needs and
preferences in this emerging area.
Objective: The purpose of this study is to ( 1) assess reasons that
stimulant-using HIV-positive MSM download and sustain their use of
mobile phone apps in general, and ( 2) obtain feedback on features and
functions that these men prefer in a mobile phone app to optimize their
ART adherence.
Methods: Focus groups were conducted with stimulant-using HIV-positive
MSM ( 24-57 years of age; mostly non-Hispanic white; 42\% once a week or
more frequent stimulant drug use) in San Francisco and Minneapolis. Our
aim was to explore the mobile phone app features and functions that they
considered when deciding to download and sustain their use of general
apps over time, as well as specific features and functions that they
would like to see incorporated into an ART adherence mobile app. Focus
groups were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis
was applied to transcripts using line-by-line open coding and organizing
codes into meaningful themes.
Results: Men reported that they currently had a variety of health and
wellness, social media and networking, gaming and entertainment, and
utility apps on their mobile phones. Downloading apps to their mobile
phones was influenced by the cost of the app, recommendations by a
trusted source, and the time it takes to download. In addition,
downloading and sustained use of apps was more likely to occur when men
had control over most features of the app and apps were perceived to be
useful, engaging, secure, and credible. Participants suggested that ART
adherence mobile phone apps include social networking features,
connections to local resources and their medical chart, and breaking HIV
news and updates. Although some men expressed concerns about daily
self-monitoring of HIV medication doses, many appreciated receiving a
summary of their medication adherence over time and suggested that
feedback about missed doses be delivered in an encouraging and humorous
manner.
Conclusions: In this study, we were able to recruit a relatively high
proportion ( 42\%) of HIV-positive MSM reporting weekly or more
stimulant use. These results suggest critical design elements that may
need to be considered during development of ART adherence-related mobile
phone apps for this, and possibly other, high-risk groups. In
particular, finding the optimal balance of security, engagement,
usefulness, control capabilities, and credibility will be critical to
sustained used of HIV treatment apps.

TI  - Creating gameful design in mhealth: A participatory co-design approach
IS  - 12
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: Gameful designs (gamification), using design pieces and concepts typically found in the world of games, is a promising approach to increase users’ engagement with, and adherence to, electronic health and mobile health (mHealth) tools. Even though both identifying and addressing users’ requirements and needs are important steps of designing information technology tools, little is known about the users’ requirements and preferences for gameful designs in the context of self-management of chronic conditions. Objective: This study aimed to present findings as well as the applied methods and design activities from a series of participatory design workshops with patients with chronic conditions, organized to generate and explore user needs, preferences, and ideas to the implementation of gameful designs in an mHealth self-management app. Methods: We conducted three sets of two consecutive co-design workshops with a total of 22 participants with chronic conditions. In the workshops, we applied participatory design methods to engage users in different activities such as design games, scenario making, prototyping, and sticky notes exercises. The workshops were filmed, and the participants’ interactions, written products, ideas, and suggestions were analyzed thematically. Results: During the workshops, the participants identified a wide range of requirements, concerns, and ideas for using the gameful elements in the design of an mHealth self-management app. Overall inputs on the design of the app concerned aspects such as providing a positive user experience by promoting collaboration and not visibly losing to someone or by designing all feedback in the app to be uplifting and positive. The participants provided both general inputs (regarding the degree of competitiveness, use of rewards, or possibilities for customization) and specific inputs (such as being able to customize the look of their avatars or by having rewards that can be exchanged for real-world goods in a gift shop). However, inputs also highlighted the importance of making tools that provide features that are meaningful and motivating on their own and do not only have to rely on gameful design features to make people use them. Conclusions: The main contribution in this study was users’ contextualized and richly described needs and requirements for gamefully designed mHealth tools for supporting chronic patients in self-management as well as the methods and techniques used to facilitate and support both the participant’s creativity and communication of ideas and inputs. The range, variety, and depth of the inputs from our participants also showed the appropriateness of our design approach and activities. These findings may be combined with literature and relevant theories to further inform in the selection and application of gameful designs in mHealth apps, or they can be used as a starting point for conducting more participatory workshops focused on co-designing gameful health apps. © Stian Jessen, Jelena Mirkovic, Cornelia M Ruland.

TI  - Critical Success Factors (CSFs) Model for Military Training Mobile Gaming Apps (MG apps)
IS  - 5
VL  - 13
AB  - Mobile gaming is a part of worldwide Information and Communication Technology (ICT) characterized by new paradigms and rapid growth (ICT). Integrating mobile games into military training equips trainee officers with the requisite effectiveness, efficiency, and enjoyment to accomplish training assignments. To ensure the optimization and quality of mobile gaming, it is vital to study key success factors (CSFs) to design app user interfaces. This study aims to develop a CSFs model of mobile gaming apps (MG apps) and assess the applicability of the model in military training. This research intends to examine the CSFs of MG apps, build a structure of CSFs of MG apps, and develop a CSFs model of MG apps for the purpose of military training. In the study, a sample of hundreds of cadet officers from the Malaysian Military Training Academy was utilized. The research was conducted in three phases: theoretical analysis, empirical study, and development of the proposed CSFs model of MG apps in military training. This paradigm is helpful to sectors of ICT and Defence Technology as an alternative way to ensure the success of the development of MG apps for military and armed forces education and training. This strategy also provides a new successful mechanism and assurance for using MG apps in military and armed forces education and training, as well as ICT-savvy cadet officers from Malaysia. © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.

IS  - 2
VL  - 16
AB  - The progress of mobile communication, the advent of electronic gadgets and portable devices, the development of the Internet and social networks, etc. have brought about a profound change in the way people, especially young people, seek information so as to make the best decisions when purchasing products, brands, services, etc. Millennials/Generation Y members (people born between 1980/1981 and 1994/1995) and Generation Z members (people born between 1994/1995 and 2010) spend more and more hours daily in the virtual environment, listening to music, playing games, communicating or exchanging information and impressions. Gen Xers (people born between 1965 and 1979/1980) also use the digital environment to seek information about the characteristics of products selected during the purchasing process, but in parallel with traditional channels of communication, which they continue to heavily rely upon. Being aware of these realities, the authors conducted an exploratory empirical study of Generation X, Y and Z members in an emerging market (Romania), which highlights the way these generations identify the products that best suit their expectations and preferences. In their study, the authors set to identify the relevant factors that determine the use of social networks by the three generations of consumers to communicate and seek information, as well as the connection between social media communication and information seeking, and the use of personal sources of information (family, friends, colleagues, other consumers) during the buying decision-making process. © University of Latvia, 2002-2017.

TI  - Cue-reactivity to distal cues in individuals at risk for gaming disorder
VL  - 125
AB  - Background: Gaming disorder (GD) is a disorder due to addictive behaviors (ICD-11). Cue-reactivity and craving are relevant mechanisms in the development and maintenance of addictive behaviors. When confronted with cues showing in-game content (proximal cues) individuals with higher symptom severity show increased cue-reactivity. Based on conditioning and addiction theories on incentive sensitization, cue-reactivity responses may generalize to more distal cues, e.g. when individuals at risk of developing a GD are confronted with a starting page of an online game. In cue-reactivity paradigms so far, only proximal gaming cues have been used. Methods: We investigated the effect of distal gaming cues compared to gaming-unrelated control cues on cue-reactivity and craving in 88 individuals with non-problematic use of online games (nPGU) and 69 individuals at risk for GD (rGD). The distal cues showed the use of an electronic device (e.g., desktop PC or smartphone) whose screen showed starting pages of either games (target cues), shopping- or pornography sites (control cues) from a first-person perspective. Findings: We found significantly higher urge and arousal ratings as well as longer viewing times for gaming-related compared to gaming-unrelated control cues in rGD compared to nPGU. Valence ratings did not differ between groups. Interpretation: The results demonstrate that already distal gaming-specific cues lead to cue-reactivity and craving in rGD. This finding indicates that based on conditioning processes, cue-reactivity and craving develop during the course of GD and generalize to cues that are only moderately related to the specific gaming activity. © 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - Cyberbullying Awareness Intervention in Digital and Non-digital Environment for Youth: Current Knowledge
IS  - 6
VL  - 28
AB  - Cyberbullying is widely acknowledged as a serious public health problem affecting adolescents and youth. Numerous digital and non-digital interventions have been developed to minimize cyberbullying occurrences considering the negative social and psychological effects of cyberbullying on youths’ development. Therefore, to gain deeper insight into the existing intervention programs, this review aims to examine the intervention programs for youth published up to 2022. The literature search was conducted on several academic databases, including ProQuest, Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar. Youth who experienced cyberbullying reported negative emotions, including depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts. Regardless of their duration and intervention strategies, most studies, such as Conectado, Cyberprogram 2.0, and KiVa study show an increase in awareness of CB risk and decreased cyber aggression and victimization in the intervention, which consisted of digital, non-digital, focused, or universal approaches. Studies have shown that while some programs were designed to create awareness and prevent cyberbullying, others were designed to interfere with cyberbullying, and others were designed to accomplish both. Cyberbullying programs were more successful when administered by technology-savvy content experts compared to educators, regardless of the intervention type, program duration, or presence of parental engagement. Studies revealed that the crucial component of effective interventions includes awareness training, coping skills, and interactive serious games. The results of this review are crucial to influencing future investigations into intervention by tailoring digital programs for a wider audience, particularly those in underdeveloped nations.

TI  - Daily Life Activities of Children during the Pandemic
IS  - 3
VL  - 10
AB  - The aim of this descriptive study was to examine the views of parents with children between the ages of 3-6 on their children's daily life activities during the pandemic. The study sample was composed of 65 parents, among whom 60 were mothers, and five were fathers, who were selected with the snowball method and who had children between the ages of 3-6 and voluntarily participated in the study. The data were collected through the General Information Form and the Family Interview Form, which were developed in line with expert opinions. The collected data were analyzed using percentage and frequency values. The findings suggested that, during the pandemic, the children's family relationships were positively affected; the duration of using technological tools increased; the children started to wash their hands more carefully; and duration of activities, such as drawing and chores, and plays increased. It was also found that the children mostly preferred piece assembly games; their physical movement needs were not fully satisfied; and there was no change in their health conditions, self-care skills, diet, sleep patterns, interactive book reading, and purposes of using technology. In line with the findings, parents, experts were given specific recommendations. © 2021 Lifescience Global.

TI  - Deception in video games: Examining varieties of griefing
IS  - 3
VL  - 37
AB  - Purpose - Though not new to online gamers, griefing - an act of play intended to cause grief to game players - is fairly understudied in LIS scholarship. The purpose of this paper is to expand the inventory of griefing varieties, consider their deceptive elements and examine attitudes towards the phenomenon. Design/methodology/approach - The authors collected and content analysed 80 (non-elicited) posts from the Something Awful forum thread and compared them to the results of ten (elicited) e-mail interviews. Findings - As a complex phenomenon, griefing has multiple interpretations and opposing attitudes. The thread results show that griefers, as perpetrators, have predominantly positive or neutral attitudes towards the act. About 15 per cent of the examined griefers reportedly resort to deceptive techniques. More extravagant griefs that require verbal interactions in player-versus-player (PvP) online games involve deception and often fall into two categories: scamming or greed play (prioritising personal benefits). The authors found self-reported instances of deception by scheming, luring, entrapment, pretence and verbal concealment in griefing acts. The interview respondents, as predominantly victims of griefs, do not think of griefing (or may not be aware of it) as an act of deception and primarily associate it with harassment (inciting emotional reactions) or power imposition (exerting superiority). Casual griefing - refusing to comply with the rules for mere entertainment - stands out as another griefing variety. Originality/value - With the growth of popularity of video gaming, libraries are largely unaware of griefing and should be prepared to address it in video game use policies for online gaming units or tournaments. Online gaming affords a unique opportunity to examine deception in computer-mediated human-to-human communication. The complexity of the phenomenon and associated opposing views are offered here to be weighted by the LIS scholars and professionals. Copyright © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

TI  - Deductive verification of alternating systems
IS  - 4–5
VL  - 20
AB  - Alternating systems are models of computer programs whose behavior is governed by the actions of multiple agents with, potentially, different goals. Examples include control systems, resource schedulers, security protocols, auctions and election mechanisms. Proving properties about such systems has emerged as an important new area of study in formal verification, with the development of logical frameworks such as the alternating temporal logic ATL*. Techniques for model checking ATL* over finite-state systems have been well studied, but many important systems are infinite-state and thus their verification requires, either explicitly or implicitly, some form of deductive reasoning. This paper presents a theoretical framework for the analysis of alternating infinite-state systems. It describes models of computation, of various degrees of generality, and alternating-time logics such as ATL* and its variations. It then develops a proof system that allows to prove arbitrary ATL* properties over these infinite-state models. The proof system is shown to be complete relative to validities in the weakest possible assertion language. The paper then derives auxiliary proof rules and verification diagrams techniques and applies them to security protocols, deriving a new formal proof of fairness of a multi-party contract signing protocol where the model of the protocol and of the properties contains both game-theoretic and infinite-state (parameterized) aspects.

TI  - Design and empirical evaluation of a multitouch interaction game-like app for fostering early embodied math learning
VL  - 175
AB  - The ubiquity of mobile devices has made mobile touchscreen interaction a promising avenue for learning. Although children start using educational apps from early age, only a few apps adhere to interaction design recommendations and undergo empirical evaluation of their educational potential. In this paper, we describe the concept and design of an app developed for promoting early math learning through finger-based multi-touch interactions in kindergarten children. Drawing from research on embodied cognition, our app provides games for fostering finger counting as well as finger-based representation of cardinal magnitude and part-whole relations. The app's efficiency was empirically evaluated through a pre-post-intervention study design with two control conditions. Results revealed that a short-term intervention with the math app did not significantly improve children's math skills when compared to learning gains of both a content-matched, unplugged math training program and a passive, waiting list control group. We discuss possible methodological reasons underlying these results, considering key curricular differences for the effectiveness of app-based interventions in early childhood education. Finally, we reflect on the appropriateness of complex multitouch interaction for young kindergarten children and suggest future directions for research in child-centered interaction design. © 2023

TI  - Design and evaluation of a computer game to promote a healthy diet for young adults
IS  - 2
VL  - 24
AB  - This article reports the development and evaluation of a computer game (RightWay Café) as a special medium to promote a healthy diet for young adults. Structural features of computer games, such as interactive tailoring, role playing, the element of fun, and narrative, were operationalized in the RightWay Café game to afford behavior rehearsal in a safe and entertaining way. Theories such as the health belief model, social cognitive theory, and theory of reasoned action guided the content design of the game to influence mediators of behavior change, including self-efficacy, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and behavior change intention. A randomized controlled evaluation study with pretest, posttest, and follow-up design demonstrated that this game was effective in teaching nutrition and weight management knowledge and increasing people's self-efficacy and perceived benefits of healthy eating, as well as their intention to be on a healthy diet. Limited long-term effects were also found: participants in the game-playing group had greater self-efficacy than participants in the control group after 1 month. This study validates the computer game-based approach to health promotion for young adults. Limitations and implications are also discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Design and feasibility study of the mobile application stoptheSPread
VL  - 8
AB  - The emergence of recent disease outbreaks calls for the design of new educational games aimed at increasing awareness in disease prevention. This article presents StopTheSpread, an educational mobile application that seeks to improve awareness about the best practices to prevent the spreading of seasonal flu in the general public. StopTheSpread integrates concepts in network science and epidemiology, within a freely available mobile application that provides a unique learning experience for free-choice learners about flu prevention. StopTheSpread teaches users basic concepts about flu prevention, within a series of games of increasing difficulty that maintain user engagement and offers a user-friendly design. StopTheSpread provides a summary of the best practices to prevent flu spreading according to the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization, while connecting users to citizen science projects aimed at worldwide flu tracking. Through Facebook, Twitter, and email we reached volunteers during the COVID-19 confinement, to conduct an online feasibility study, toward assessing learning outcome in playing with our mobile application. Our results indicate that the use of StopTheSpread increased by 20% the awareness about the spreading mechanism of flu, compared with the baseline population. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

TI  - Design and Implementation of a Novel Web-Based E-Learning Tool for
Education of Health Professionals on the Antibiotic Vancomycin
IS  - 3
VL  - 19
AB  - Background
Traditional approaches to health professional education are being
challenged by increased clinical demands and decreased available time.
Web-based e-learning tools offer a convenient and effective method of
delivering education, particularly across multiple health care
facilities. The effectiveness of this model for health professional
education needs to be explored in context.
Objectives
The study aimed to (1) determine health professionals' experience and
knowledge of clinical use of vancomycin, an antibiotic used for
treatment of serious infections caused by methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and (2) describe the design and
implementation of a Web-based e-learning tool created to improve
knowledge in this area.
Methods
We conducted a study on the design and implementation of a
video-enhanced, Web based e-learning tool between April 2014 and January
2016. A Web-based survey was developed to determine prior experience and
knowledge of vancomycin use among nurses, doctors, and pharmacists. The
Vancomycin Interactive (VI) involved a series of video clips
interspersed with question and answer scenarios, where a correct
response allowed for progression. Dramatic tension and humor were used
as tools to engage users. Health professionals' knowledge of clinical
vancomycin use was obtained from website data; qualitative participant
feedback was also collected.
Results
From the 577 knowledge survey responses, pharmacists (n=70) answered the
greatest number of questions correctly (median score 4/5), followed by
doctors (n=271; 3/5) and nurses (n=236; 2/5; P<.001). Survey questions
on target trough concentration (75.0\%, 433/577) and rate of
administration (64.9\%, 375/577) were answered most correctly, followed
by timing of first level (49\%, 283/577), maintenance dose (41.9\%,
242/577), and loading dose (38.0\%, 219/577). Self-reported ``very{''}
and ``reasonably{''} experienced health professionals were also more
likely to achieve correct responses. The VI was completed by 163
participants during the study period. The rate of correctly answered VI
questions on first attempt was 65\% for nurses (n=63), 68\% for doctors
(n=86), and 82\% for pharmacists (n=14; P<.001), reflecting a similar
pattern to the knowledge survey. Knowledge gaps were identified for
loading dose (39.2\% correct on first attempt; 64/163), timing of first
trough level (50.3\%, 82/163), and subsequent trough levels (47.9\%,
78/163). Of the 163 participants, we received qualitative user feedback
from 51 participants following completion of the VI. Feedback was
predominantly positive with themes of ``entertaining,{''}
``engaging,{''} and ``fun{''} identified; however, there were some
technical issues identified relating to accessibility from different
operating systems and browsers.
Conclusions
A novel Web-based e-learning tool was successfully developed combining
game design principles and humor to improve user engagement. Knowledge
gaps were identified that allowed for targeting of future education
strategies. The VI provides an innovative model for delivering Web-based
education to busy health professionals in different locations.

TI  - Designing the optimal digital health intervention for patients' use before and after elective orthopedic surgery: Qualitative study
IS  - 3
VL  - 23
AB  - Background: Health behavior changes made by patients during the perioperative period can impact the outcomes and success of elective surgeries. However, there remains a limited understanding of how best to support patients during this time, particularly through the use of digital health interventions. Recognizing and understanding the potential unmet needs of elective orthopedic surgery patients is central to motivating healthier behavior change, improving recovery, and optimizing overall surgical success in the short and long term. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore patient perspectives on technology features that would help support them to change their lifestyle behaviors during the pre- and postoperative periods, and that could potentially maintain long-term healthy lifestyles following recovery. Methods: Semistructured interviews with pre- and postoperative elective orthopedic patients were conducted between May and June 2020 using telephone and video call-based software. Patient perspectives on the use of digital technologies to complement current surgical care and support with lifestyle behavior changes were discussed. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Reflexive thematic analysis enabled the development of themes from the data, with QSR NVivo software (version 12) facilitating data management. Ethical approval was obtained from the National Health Service Health Research Authority. Results: A total of 18 participants were interviewed. Four themes were developed from the data regarding the design and functionality of digital technologies to best support the perioperative journey. These center around an intervention's ability to incorporate interactive, user-centered features; direct a descriptive and structured recovery; enable customizable, patient-controlled settings; and deliver both general and specific surgical advice in a timely manner. Interventions that are initiated preoperatively and continued postoperatively were perceived as beneficial. Interventions designed with personalized milestones were found to better guide patients through a structured recovery. Individualized tailoring of preparatory and recovery information was desired by patients with previously high levels of physical activity before surgery. The use of personalized progression-based exercises further encouraged physical recovery; game-like rewards and incentives were regarded as motivational for making and sustaining health behavior change. In-built video calling and messaging features offered connectivity with peers and clinicians for supported care delivery. Conclusions: Specific intervention design and functionality features can provide better, structured support for elective orthopedic patients across the entire surgical journey and beyond. This study provides much-needed evidence relating to the optimal design and timing of digital interventions for elective orthopedic surgical patients. Findings from this study suggest a desire for personalized perioperative care, in turn, supporting patients to make health behavior changes to optimize surgical success. These findings should be used to influence future co-design projects to enable the design and implementation of patient-focused, tailored, and targeted digital health technologies within modern health care settings. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

TI  - Design of an exergame system for knee osteoarthritis rehabilitation
based on the exercise prescription
AB  - Exercise therapy is an important rehabilitation method for knee
osteoarthritis (KOA) patients. This paper developed an exercise
game(exergame) system based on Azure Kinect to help KOA patients
accurately perform exercise prescriptions and improve their compliance
with active exercise. The proposed system digitizes the KOA exercise
prescription formulated by the physician and designs a personalized
exergame, guiding the KOA patients to perform the correct rehabilitation
exercise. Besides, the system employs the Azure Kinect to collect the
user's main joint position information and assist in recognizing the
user's rehabilitation training actions. We recruited 3 rehabilitation
physicians and 30 KOA patients (experimental group: 20, control group:
10) to conduct a clinical trial aimed at evaluating the usability of the
system and user satisfaction. Based on the data recorded by the system
and evaluations conducted by the physicians, we found that the
experimental group demonstrated an impressive accuracy rate of 97.47\%
in executing actions, which was significantly higher than the control
group. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in
guiding the rehabilitation training of KOA patients. The system achieved
an accuracy of 95.42\% for action recognition, demonstrating that the
exergame is reliably interactive. According to the analysis of the UEQ-S
questionnaire, the average satisfaction score of the experimental group
with the system was (1.68 +/- 0.893). These results indicate that the
system is capable of providing an exceptional user experience,
ultimately increasing patients' willingness and compliance to engage in
active exercises. The above experiments confirmed that the proposed
exergame system has high usability and an ideal user experience and is
suitable for home active exercise therapy for KOA patients.

TI  - Determinants of adolescent physical activity and inactivity patterns.
IS  - 6
VL  - 105
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite recognition of the important influence of environmental determinants on physical activity patterns, minimal empirical research has been done to assess the impact of environmental/contextual determinants of physical activity. This article aims to investigate environmental and sociodemographic determinants of physical activity and inactivity patterns among subpopulations of US adolescents. We define environmental determinants as modifiable factors in the physical environment that impose a direct influence on the opportunity to engage in physical activity. The present research examines environmental and sociodemographic determinants of physical activity and inactivity with the implication that these findings can point toward societal-level intervention strategies for increasing physical activity and decreasing inactivity among adolescents. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: The study population consists of nationally representative data from the 1996 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health on 17 766 US adolescents enrolled in US middle and high schools (including 3933 non-Hispanic blacks, 3148 Hispanics, and 1337 Asians). Hours/week of inactivity (TV/video viewing and video/computer games) and times/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity were collected by questionnaire. Outcome variables were moderate to vigorous physical activity and inactivity, which were broken into categories (physical activity: 0-2 times/week, 3-4 times/week, and >/=5 times/week; inactivity: 0-10 hours/week, 11-24 hours/week, and >/=25 hours/week). Sociodemographic and environmental correlates of physical activity and inactivity were used as exposure and control variables and included sex, age, urban residence, participation in school physical education program, use of community recreation center, total reported incidents of serious crime in neighborhood, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, generation of residence in the United States, presence of mother/father in household, pregnancy status, work status, in-school status, region, and month of interview. Logistic regression models of high versus low and medium physical activity and inactivity were used to investigate sex and ethnic interactions in relation to environmental and sociodemographic factors to examine evidence for the potential impact of physical education and recreation programs and sociodemographic factors on physical activity and inactivity patterns. RESULTS: Moderate to vigorous physical activity was lower and inactivity higher for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adolescents. Participation in school physical education programs was considerably low for these adolescents and decreased with age. Participation in daily school physical education (PE) program classes (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.21; confidence interval [CI]: 1.82-2.68) and use of a community recreation center (AOR: 1.75; CI: 1.56-1.96) were associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in high level moderate to vigorous physical activity. Maternal education was inversely associated with high inactivity patterns; for example, having a mother with a graduate or professional degree was associated with an AOR of.61 (CI:.48-.76) for high inactivity. High family income was associated with increased moderate to vigorous physical activity (AOR: 1.43; CI: 1.22-1.67) and decreased inactivity (AOR:.70; CI:.59-.82). High neighborhood serious crime level was associated with a decreased likelihood of falling in the highest category of moderate to vigorous physical activity (AOR:.77; CI:.66-.91). CONCLUSIONS: These results show important associations between modifiable environmental factors, such as participation in school PE and community recreation programs, with activity patterns of adolescents. Despite the marked and significant impact of participation in school PE programs on physical activity patterns of US adolescents, few adolescents participated in such school PE programs; only 21.3% of all adolescents

TI  - Developing an alcohol and other drug serious game for adolescents: considerations for improving student engagement
IS  - 5
VL  - 46
AB  - Objectives: To explore perceptions of alcohol and other drug (AOD) education and digital game design preferences among Australian adolescents with the goal of identifying key factors to promote engagement in an AOD serious game for Australian secondary school students. Methods: Semi-structured focus groups were conducted with 36 adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants described heightened engagement with AOD education that incorporated relatable and relevant real-life stories and interactive discussions. They also expressed a desire for learning to focus on practical strategies to reduce AOD harm and overcome social pressure to use AOD. Participants highlighted the importance of incorporating relatable characters and context-relevant scenarios in promoting engagement, and identified social elements, player choice, and optimal challenge as important game design considerations. Conclusions: A focus on meaningful realistic scenarios, relatable characters, relevant information and practical skills may promote high school aged students’ engagement with AOD educational content. Game designs incorporating social elements and decision-making opportunities may be conducive to promoting engagement and enhancing learning. Implications for public health: Findings from this study can be used by researchers and game designers for the development of future AOD serious games targeted at Australian adolescents. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Developing and evaluating ASTHMAXcel adventures: A novel gamified mobile application for pediatric patients with asthma
IS  - 5
VL  - 125
AB  - Background: The ASTHMAXcel mobile application has been linked to favorable outcomes among adult patients with asthma. Objective: To assess the impact of ASTHMAXcel Adventures, a gamified, guideline-based, pediatric version on asthma control, knowledge, health care utilization, and patient satisfaction. Methods: Pediatric patients with asthma received the ASTHMAXcel Adventures mobile intervention on-site only at baseline (visit 1), 4 months (visit 2), and 6 months (visit 3). The asthma control test, asthma illness representation scale–self-administered, pediatric asthma impact survey, and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 were used to assess asthma control, knowledge, and patient satisfaction. Patients reported the number of asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and oral prednisone use. Results: A total of 39 patients completed the study. The proportion of controlled asthma increased from visit 1 to visits 2 and 3 (30.8% vs 53.9%, P = .04; 30.8% vs 59.0%, P = .02), and largely seen in boys. The mean asthma illness representation scale–self-administered scores increased from baseline pre- to postintervention, with sustained improvements at visits 2 and 3 (3.55 vs 3.76, P < .001; 3.55 vs 3.80, P = .001; 3.55 vs 3.99, P < .001). The pediatric asthma impact survey scores improved from baseline to visits 2 and 3 (43.33 vs 34.08, P < .001; 43.33 vs 31.74, P < .001). ED visits and prednisone use significantly decreased from baseline to visits 2 and 3 (ED: 0.46 vs 0.13, P = .03; 0.46 vs 0.02, P = .02; prednisone use, 0.49 vs 0.13, P = .02; 0.49 vs 0.03, P = .003. Satisfaction was high with mean client satisfaction questionnaire score of approximately 30 (out of 32) at all visits. Conclusion: ASTHMAXcel Adventures improved asthma control, knowledge, and quality of life, and reduced ED visits and prednisone use with high satisfaction scores. © 2020 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology

TI  - Developing and Piloting Videogames to Increase College and University
Students' Awareness and Efficacy of the Bystander Role in Incidents of
Sexual Violence
IS  - 1
VL  - 8
AB  - Objective: Researchers at the Prevention Innovations Research Center at
the University of New Hampshire and the Tiltfactor Laboratory at
Dartmouth College collaborated with students to create two videogames to
teach college students bystander intervention skills in situations of
sexual and relationship violence and stalking. Materials and Methods: A
key strength of the present study is the collaboration with students to
educate game development. The research team pooled its ideas to create a
trivia game and an interactive scenario game that were pilot tested on
first-year students in a midsized campus of a northeastern university.
``Each game included subject matter related to sexual assault and
bystander intervention, as well as general campus information so the
main themes of the game would not be overt and potentially cause
participants to resist shifting their attitudes about sexual assault and
bystander intervention.{''} Participants completed a pretest and
posttest at each testing session and were invited to complete an online
follow-up survey 4 weeks following the session. Results: Researchers
found that both games had a significant impact on participant bystander
efficacy and attitude scores. The interactive scenario game was
especially effective in increasing male attitudes toward bystander
intervention. The results were most salient for the posttest; however,
there was also an increase in male attitudes at the 4-week follow-up.
Conclusion: The student input was invaluable to the success of the game
prototypes. With their help, we concluded that gameplay shows promise as
an effective way to introduce the concept of bystander intervention and
increase bystander attitudes and efficacy in situations of sexual and
relationship violence and stalking to first-year college students.

TI  - Developing a serious videogame for preteens to motivate HPV vaccination decision making: Land of secret gardens
IS  - 1
VL  - 7
AB  - Introduction: Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is routinely recommended for ages 11-12, yet in 2016 only 49.5% of women and 37.5% of men had completed the three-dose series in the United States. Offering information and cues to action through a serious videogame for preteens may foster HPV vaccination awareness, information seeking, and communication. Materials and Methods: An iterative process was used to develop an interactive videogame, Land of Secret Gardens. Three focus groups were conducted with 16 boys and girls, ages 11-12, for input on game design, acceptability, and functioning. Two parallel focus groups explored parents' (n = 9) perspectives on the game concept. Three researchers identified key themes. Results: Preteens wanted a game that is both entertaining and instructional. Some parents were skeptical that games could be motivational. A back-story about a secret garden was developed as a metaphor for a preteen's body and keeping it healthy. The goal is to plant a lush secret garden and protect the seedlings by treating them with a potion when they sprout to keep them healthy as they mature. Points to buy seeds and create the potion are earned by playing mini-games. Throughout play, players are exposed to messaging about HPV and the benefits of the vaccine. Both boys and girls liked the garden concept and getting facts about HPV. Parents were encouraged to discuss the game with their preteens. Conclusion: Within a larger communication strategy, serious games could be useful for engaging preteens in health decision making about HPV vaccination. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.

TI  - Developing a Video Game as an Awareness and Research Tool Based on SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiological Dynamics and Motivational Perspectives
VL  - 2023
AB  - In mid-2020, the University of Liège (ULiège, Belgium) commissioned the ULiège Video Game Research Laboratory (Liège Game Lab) and the AR/VR Lab of the HEC-Management School of ULiège to create a serious game to raise awareness of preventive measures for its university community. This project has its origins in two objectives of the institutional policy of ULiège in response to the crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 to raise awareness among community members of various preventive actions that can reduce the spread of the virus and to inform about the emergence and progression of a pandemic. After almost two years of design, the project resulted in the creation of SARS Wars, a decision-making management game for browsers and smartphones. This article presents the creative process of the game, specifically the integration of an adapted SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model, as well as the modeling of intercompartmental circulation dynamics in the game’s algorithm, and the various limitations observed regarding the game’s original missions and possibilities for future work. The SARS-CoV-2 video game project may be considered an innovative way to translate epidemiology into a language that can be used in the scope of citizen sciences. On the one hand, it provides an engaging tool and encourages active participation of the audience. On the other hand, it allows us to have a better understanding of the dynamic changes of a pandemic or an epidemic (crisis preparedness, monitoring, and control) and to anticipate potential consequences in the given parameters at set time (emerging risk identification), while offering insights for impact on some parameters on motivation (social science aspect). © 2023 Alexis Messina et al.

TI  - Development and Feasibility Testing of a Videogame Intervention to
Reduce High-Risk Sexual Behavior in Black and Hispanic Adolescents
IS  - 6
VL  - 7
AB  - Objective: Develop and test feasibility of a mobile videogame
intervention to decrease high-risk sexual behavior in black and Hispanic
adolescents. Materials and Methods: Iterative design to develop
intervention in partnership with target audience. Feasibility and
preliminary impact data collected at baseline, following 2-3 hours of
gameplay and at 8-week follow-up. Results: Twenty-six 15-17-year-olds
completed pilot testing: 16 (62\%) were male, 20 (77\%) black or
Hispanic. Pilot testing demonstrated feasibility, including producing a
usable videogame prototype, incorporating videogame testing within a
high school, and participants' acceptability of the videogame.
Participants' gameplay experience reflected that most would play the
videogame again (77\%), stated that they felt responsible for the
choices they made in the videogame (73\%), and would tell their friends
to play the videogame (58\%). Most suggested adding more videogame
content to further engage participants. From baseline to follow-up,
participants demonstrated improvements in condom and contraception
self-efficacy (P=0.003), risk perceptions (P=0.009), and high-risk
sexual behavior knowledge (P<0.0001). Among black or Hispanic
adolescents, we found improvements in summary measures of intentions
(P=0.04), self-efficacy (P=0.003), risk perceptions (P=0.002), and
sexual knowledge (P=0.0002). Adolescents with previous sexual experience
showed similar improvements. Conclusion: Pilot testing of an innovative
videogame, developed in partnership with the target audience,
demonstrated feasibility and preliminary impact with this cohort of
black or Hispanic adolescents. We developed a usable videogame prototype
and gained important data about how to enhance the next videogame
iteration. Future plans include targeting an older age group to maximize
our ability to measure potential impact among sexually experienced
adolescents.

TI  - Development and validation of a mobile game for culturally sensitive child sexual abuse prevention education in Tanzania: Mixed methods study
IS  - 4
VL  - 9
AB  - Background: Globally, 3 out of 20 children experience sexual abuse before the age of 18 years. Educating children about sexual abuse and prevention is an evidence-based strategy that is recommended for ending child sexual abuse. Digital games are increasingly being used to influence healthy behaviors in children and could be an efficient and friendly approach to educating children about sexual abuse prevention. However, little is known on the best way to develop a culturally sensitive game that targets children in Africa—where sexual education is still taboo—that would be engaging, effective, and acceptable to parents and caretakers. Objective: This study aimed to develop a socioculturally appropriate, mobile-based game for educating young children (<5 years) and parents and caretakers in Tanzania on sexual abuse prevention. Methods: HappyToto children’s game was co-designed with 111 parents and caretakers (females: n=58, 52.3%; male: n=53, 47.7%) of children below 18 years of age and 24 child experts in Tanzania through surveys and focus group discussions conducted from March 2020 to April 2020. From these, we derived an overview of topics, sociocultural practices, social environment, and game interface designs that should be considered when designing child sexual abuse prevention (CSAP) education interventions. We also conducted paper prototyping and storyboarding sessions for the game’s interface, storylines, and options. To validate the application’s prototype, 32 parents (females: n=18, 56%; males: n=14, 44%) of children aged 3-5 years and 5 children (females: n=2, 40%; males: n=3, 60%) of the same age group played the game for half an hour on average. The parents undertook a pre-post intervention assessment on confidence and ability to engage in CSAP education conversations, as well as exit surveys on the usability and sociocultural acceptability of the game, while children were quizzed on the topics covered and their enjoyment of the game. Results: Parents and caregivers showed interest in the developed game during the conducted surveys, and each parent on average navigated through all the parts of the game. The confidence level of parents in talking about CSAP increased from an average of 3.56 (neutral) before using the game to 4.9 (confident) after using the game. The ability scores, calculated based on a range of topics included in CSAP education talks with children, also increased from 5.67 (out of 10) to 8.8 (out of 10) after the game was played. Both confidence level and ability scores were statistically significant (P<.001). All 5 children were interested in the game and enjoyed the game-provided activities. Conclusions: The HappyToto game can thus be an effective technology-based intervention for improving the knowledge and skills of parents and children in CSAP education. © Maria Proches Malamsha, Elingarami Sauli, Edith Talina Luhanga.

VL  - 28
AB  - Objective: to elaborate and validate the content and appearance of an educational game regarding healthy lifestyle habits for adolescents Method: methodological study carried, in 2016 out in Picos (Brazil). In order to develop the initial version of the game, a survey gathered scientific information and the content. In the end, the game was divided into: home screen and the living room, kitchen and the square scene, where the sports scene was inserted. To validate the instrument, 15 experts were selected, who evaluated the content, didactics and appearance of the game. Ten adolescents evaluated the appearance and usability. In addition, one questionnaire was used for the specialists and another for the adolescents. The Content Validation Index was used to validate the game, which considered the instrument and the items as validated when an index = 0.78 was obtained. Results: the room scene had access to the kitchen and the square. The sport scene was designed for physical activity and the purchase of food, which would be consumed in the kitchen scene. The experts gave the game a Content Validation Index of 0.88 for the item “objectives”, 0.87 for “structure and presentation” and 0.99 for “relevance”, reaching a overall Content Validation Index of 0.89. For adolescents, the item “appearance” reached the index 0.97 and for the other items, 1.0 and overal index of 0.99. Conclusion: the game was validated in terms of content and appearance and could be validated clinically with adolescents as an incentive to adopt protective behaviors for their health. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

TI  - Development, implementation and assessment of a concussion education programme for high school student-athletes
IS  - 1
VL  - 36
AB  - Although experts have noted that adolescent athletes should be educated about concussions to improve their safety, there is no agreement on the most effective strategy to disseminate concussion education. The purpose of this study was to develop, implement and assess a concussion education programme. More precisely, four interactive oral presentations were delivered to high school student-athletes (N = 35, Mage = 15.94, SD = 0.34) in a large urban centre. Participants completed a questionnaire at three time-points during the season to measure changes in their knowledge (CK) and attitudes (CA) of concussions, and focus group interviews were conducted following the concussion education programme. Questionnaire data revealed participants’ post-intervention CK scores were higher than their pre-intervention scores. During the focus groups, the student-athletes said they acquired CK about the role of protective equipment and symptom variability, and in terms of CA, they intended to avoid dangerous in-game collisions in the future. Our study was the first to create and deliver a concussion education intervention across multiple time-points, and to use mixed-methods in its assessment. These findings may be of interest to researchers, practitioners and stakeholders in sport who are invested in making the sport environment safer through concussion education and awareness. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Development of a Mobile Game to Influence Behavior Determinants of HIV
Service Uptake Among Key Populations in the Philippines: User-Centered
Design Process
IS  - 4
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: Opportunities in digital distribution place mobile games as
a promising platform for games for health. However, designing a game
that can compete in the saturated mobile games market and deliver
persuasive health messages can feel like an insurmountable challenge.
Although user-centered design is widely advocated, factors such as the
user's subject domain expertise, budget constraints, and poor data
collection methods can restrict the benefits of user involvement.
Objective: This study aimed to develop a playable and acceptable game
for health, targeted at young key populations in the Philippines.
Methods: Authors identified a range of user-centered design methods to
be used in tandem from published literature. The resulting design
process involved a phased approach, with 40 primary and secondary users
engaged during the initial ideation and prototype testing stages.
Selected methods included participatory design workshops, playtests,
playability heuristics, and focus group discussions. Subject domain
experts were allocated roles in the development team. Data were analyzed
using a framework approach. Conceptual frameworks in health intervention
acceptability and game design guided the analysis. In-game events were
captured through the Unity Analytics service to monitor uptake and game
use over a 12-month period.
Results: Early user involvement revealed a strong desire for online
multiplayer gameplay, yet most reported that access to this type of game
was restricted because of technical and economic constraints. A
role-playing game (RPG) with combat elements was identified as a very
appealing gameplay style. Findings guided us to a game that could be
played offline and that blended RPG elements, such as narrative and
turn-based combat, with match-3 puzzles. Although the game received a
positive response during playtests, gameplay was at times perceived as
repetitive and predicted to only appeal to casual gamers. Knowledge
transfer was predominantly achieved through interpretation of the game's
narrative, highlighting this as an important design element. Uptake of
the game was positive; between December 1, 2017, and December 1, 2018,
3325 unique device installs were reported globally. Game metrics
provided evidence of adoption by young key populations in the
Philippines. Game uptake and use were substantially higher in regions
where direct engagement with target users took place.
Conclusions: User-centered design activities supported the
identification of important contextual requirements. Multiple data
collection methods enabled triangulation of findings to mediate the
inherent biases of the different techniques. Game acceptance is
dependent on the ability of the development team to implement design
solutions that address the needs and desires of target users. If target
users are expected to develop design solutions, they must have adequate
expertise and a significant role within the development team.
Facilitating meaningful partnerships between health professionals, the
games industry, and end users will support the games for health industry
as it matures.

TI  - Development of a mobile phone app to promote safe sex practice among youth in Stockholm, Sweden: Qualitative Study
IS  - 1
VL  - 4
AB  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) has been shown to be effective in increasing knowledge of sexual health among youth. To date, evaluations mostly refer to interventions delivered via computer, email, and text messages. The possibility of downloading apps on mobile devices has opened up opportunities to develop engaging interventions on safe sexual health promotion. To attract young users and have them engage with a sexual health app, it is important to involve youth in intervention development. Objective: This study aimed to obtain input from youth on the content of a mobile phone app intended to promote safe sex and increase condom use among youth in Stockholm. Methods: This study was conducted at the Youth Health Clinics (YHC) in Stockholm County, Sweden. A total of 15 individual in-depth interviews and 2 focus group discussions (with youth aged 18-23 years) were conducted at the YHC in Stockholm. Areas explored were: (1) youth perceptions of condom use (advantages and obstacles), (2) perceptions of mHealth to promote safe sexual practices, and (3) content development for a mobile phone app to promote safe sex. Results: The smartphone app was developed based on the categories that emerged from the data. With regard to content, youth requested sex education, including information on sexually transmitted infections. In addition, condom-specific information, including practical usage technique, advice on how to have the condom talk, and how to decrease shame related to condom use, was requested. Youth suggested different modes to deliver the content, including text messages, movie clips, and push notifications. It was suggested that the tone of the messages delivered should be fun, entertaining, and supportive. The inputs from youth influenced the development of the following sections of the app: Condom Obstacles and Solutions; Quiz; Games; Self-Refection; Challenges; Stories by Peers (stories from peers and information from a doctor); Condom Tips, Pep Talk, and Boosting; and Random Facts. Conclusions: It is important to use input from youth when developing a smartphone intervention since the success of the intervention largely depends on the level of engagement and usage by youth. Furthermore, if proven efficient in increasing condom use, it is important that the development, including content and mode, is thoroughly described so that the intervention can be replicated. Likewise, if proven inefficient, it is important to learn from mistakes to improve and adjust the intervention. The effect of this smartphone app on safe sexual practices among youth is being evaluated in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial in Stockholm (ISRCTN13212899) and will be reported separately. ©Anna Nielsen, Aspasia Bågenholm, Ayesha De Costa.

TI  - Development of the Adolescent Preoccupation with Screens Scale
VL  - 17
AB  - Background: Although public health concerns have been raised regarding
the detrimental health effects of increasing rates of electronic screen
use among adolescents, such effects have been small. Instruments
currently available tend to be lengthy, have a clinical research focus,
and assess young people's screen use on specific screen-based activities
(e.g., TV, computer, or internet). None appear to address screen use
across a broad range of screens, including mobile devices and
screen-based activities. The objective was to develop a new and short
self-report scale for investigating adolescents' screen use across all
screens and screen-based activities in non-clinical settings.
Methods: The Adolescent Preoccupation with Screens Scale (APSS) was
developed over a three stage process. First, a review of the current
literature and existing instruments was undertaken and suitable items
identified. Second, the draft APSS was piloted with adolescents and item
affectivity and discrimination indices were calculated. Third, a cross
sectional school based online survey of 1967 Australian adolescents in
grades 5 (10 years old), 7 (13 years) and 9 (15 years) from 25 randomly
selected schools was conducted.
Results: Factor Analysis on a sub-sample of the data (n = 782) and
Confirmatory Factor Analysis on the remaining sub-sample (n = 1185),
supported a two-factor model. The first factor reflects adolescents'
mood management with screen use, and the second reflects a behavioural
preoccupation. The measure demonstrated strong invariance across sex and
across Grades 5, 7, and 9. Both factors displayed good internal
consistency (alpha = .91 and .87, respectively). Sex and grade
differences on both scales were investigated and boys in Grade 5
reported higher levels of both mood management and behavioural
preoccupation with screens. There were no sex differences on mood
management in Grades 7 and 9, but girls reported higher behavioural
preoccupation in both these later grades.
Conclusion: The APSS provides researchers with a new, brief and robust
measure of potentially problematic screen use across a wide array of
screens, including mobile devices, so readily accessed during
adolescence.

TI  - Diffusion of COVID-19 in social and production networks: Simulation evidence from a dynamic model
VL  - 142
AB  - This paper presents a dynamic model to evaluate economic and public health effects of the diffusion of COVID-19. Our framework combines a SIR epidemiological model of virus diffusion with a dynamic game of network production and social interactions. The economy comprises three types of geographic locations: homes, workplaces, and consumption places. Each individual has her own set of locations where she develops her life. The combination of these sets for all the individuals determines the economy’s production and social network. Every day, individuals choose to work and consume either outside (with physical interaction with other people) or remotely (from home, without physical interactions). Working (and consuming) outside is more productive and generates stronger complementarities (positive externality). However, in the presence of a virus, working outside facilitates infection and the diffusion of the virus (negative externality). Individuals are forward-looking. We calibrate the model and implement numerical experiments to evaluate the health and economic impact of several counterfactual public policies: subsidies for working at home; testing policies; herd immunity; and changes in the network structure. These policies generate substantial differences in the propagation of the virus and its economic impact.

IS  - 10
VL  - 20
AB  - Background: An estimated 50% of adolescents and young adults (AYA) living with HIV are failing to adhere to prescribed antiretroviral treatment (ART). Digital games are effective in chronic disease management; however, research on gaming to improve ART adherence among AYA is limited. Objective: We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of video gaming to improve AYA ART adherence. Methods: Focus group discussions and surveys were administered to health care providers and AYA aged 13 to 24 years living with HIV at a pediatric HIV program in Washington, DC. During focus group discussions, AYA viewed demonstrations of 3 game prototypes linked to portable Wisepill medication dispensers. Content analysis strategies and thematic coding were used to identify adherence themes and gaming acceptance and feasibility. Likert scale and descriptive statistics were used to summarize response frequencies. Results: Providers (n=10) identified common adherence Barriers and strategies, including use of gaming analogies to improve AYA ART adherence. Providers supported exploration of digital gaming as an adherence intervention. In 6 focus group discussions, 12 AYA participants identified disclosure of HIV status and irregular daily schedules as major Barriers to ART and use of alarms and pillboxes as reminders. Most AYA were very or somewhat likely to use the demonstrated game prototypes to help with ART adherence and desired challenging, individually tailored, user-friendly games with in-game incentives. Game prototypes were modified accordingly. Conclusions: AYA and their providers supported the use of digital games for ART adherence support. Individualization and in-game incentives were preferable and informed the design of an interactive technology-based adherence intervention among AYA living with HIV. © Amanda D Castel, Saba Qasmieh, Daniel Greenberg, Nicole Ellenberger, Tyriesa Howard Howell, Caleb Griffith, Brittany C Wilbourn, Kavitha Ganesan, Nadia Hussein, Gabriel Ralte, Natella Rakhmanina.

TI  - Digital Health Secondary Prevention Using Co-Design Procedures: Focus Group Study With Health Care Providers and Patients With Myocardial Infarction
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a debilitating condition and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Digital health is a promising approach for delivering secondary prevention to support patients with a history of MI and for reducing risk factors that can lead to a future event. However, its potential can only be fulfilled when the technology meets the needs of the end users who will be interacting with this secondary prevention. Objective: We aimed to gauge the opinions of patients with a history of MI and health professionals concerning the functions, features, and characteristics of a digital health solution to support post-MI care. Methods: Our approach aligned with the gold standard participatory co-design procedures enabling progressive refinement of feedback via exploratory, confirmatory, and prototype-assisted feedback from participants. Patients with a history of MI and health professionals from Australia attended focus groups over a videoconference system. We engaged with 38 participants across 3 rounds of focus groups using an iterative co-design approach. Round 1 included 8 participants (4 patients and 4 health professionals), round 2 included 24 participants (11 patients and 13 health professionals), and round 3 included 22 participants (14 patients and 8 health professionals). Results: Participants highlighted the potential of digital health in addressing the unmet needs of post-MI care. Both patients with a history of MI and health professionals agreed that mental health is a key concern in post-MI care that requires further support. Participants agreed that family members can be used to support postdischarge care and require support from the health care team. Participants agreed that incorporating simple games with a points system can increase long-term engagement. However, patients with a history of MI emphasized a lack of support from their health care team, family, and community more strongly than health professionals. They also expressed some openness to using artificial intelligence, whereas health professionals expressed that users should not be aware of artificial intelligence use. Conclusions: These results provide valuable insights into the development of digital health secondary preventions aimed at supporting patients with a history of MI. Future research can implement a pilot study in the population with MI to trial these recommendations in a real-world setting. © The Author(s) 2023.

TI  - Dissociable brain mechanisms for processing social exclusion and rule violation
IS  - 3
VL  - 54
AB  - Social exclusion inherently involves an element of expectancy violation, in that we expect other people to follow the unwritten rule to include us in social interactions. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we employed a unique modification of an interactive virtual ball-tossing game called "Cyberball" (Williams et al., 2000) and a novel paradigm called "Cybershape," in which rules are broken in the absence of social exclusion, to dissociate brain regions that process social exclusion from rule violations more generally. Our Cyberball game employed an alternating block design and removed evoked responses to events when the participant was throwing the ball in inclusion to make this condition comparable to exclusion, where participants did not throw. With these modifications, we replicated prior findings of ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), insula, and posterior cingulate cortex activity evoked by social exclusion relative to inclusion. We also identified exclusion-evoked activity in the hippocampi, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and left middle temporal gyrus. Comparing social exclusion and rule violation revealed a functional dissociation in the active neural systems as well as differential functional connectivity with vACC. Some overlap was observed in regions differentially modulated by social exclusion and rule violation, including the vACC and lateral parietal cortex. These overlapping brain regions showed different activation during social exclusion compared to rule violation, each relative to fair play. Comparing activation patterns to social exclusion and rule violation allowed for the dissociation of brain regions involved in the experience of exclusion versus expectancy violation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Distraction with a hand-held video game reduces pediatric preoperative anxiety
IS  - 10
VL  - 16
AB  - Background: Video games have received widespread application in health care for distraction and behavior modification therapy. Studies on the effect of cognitive distraction during the preoperative period are lacking. We evaluated the efficacy of an interactive distraction, a hand-held video game (VG) in reducing preoperative anxiety in children. Methods: In a randomized, prospective study of 112 children aged 4-12 years undergoing outpatient surgery, anxiety was assessed after admission and again at mask induction of anesthesia, using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS). Postoperative behavior changes were assessed with the Posthospital Behavior Questionnaire (PHBQ). Patients were randomly assigned to three groups: parent presence (PP), PP + a hand-held VG, and PP + 0.5 mg·kg-1 oral midazolam (M) given >20 min prior to entering the operating room. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in anxiety (P < 0.01) in groups M and PP at induction of anesthesia compared with baseline, but not in VG group. VG patients demonstrated a decrease in anxiety from baseline (median change in mYPAS -3), the difference compared with PP (+11.8) was significant (P = 0.04). The change in anxiety in the M group (+7.3) was not statistically different from other groups. Sixty-three percent of patients in VG group had no change or decrease in anxiety after treatment, compared with 26% in M group and 28% in PP group (P = 0.01). There was no difference in anxiety changes between female and male patients. Conclusions: A hand-held VG can be offered to most children as a low cost, easy to implement, portable, and effective method to reduce anxiety in the preoperative area and during induction of anesthesia. Distraction in a pleasurable and familiar activity provides anxiety relief, probably through cognitive and motor absorption. © 2006 The Authors.

TI  - Do casual gaming environments evoke stereotype threat? Examining the effects of explicit priming and avatar gender
VL  - 78
AB  - Despite relatively equal participation rates between females and males in casual gaming, females often report stigmatisation and prejudice towards their gaming competency within this sub-domain. Applying the theoretical framework of “stereotype threat”, this research examined the influence of explicit stereotype priming on females' casual gameplay performance and related attitudes. It also investigated whether the gender of the game avatar heightens susceptibility to stereotype threat. One hundred and twenty females were allocated randomly to one of four experimental conditions in a 2 (Condition: Stereotype threat, Control) x 2 (Avatar gender: Feminine, Masculine) between-subjects design. They completed a short gaming task and measures of social identity, competence beliefs, gameplay self-efficacy and self-esteem. Findings indicate that priming explicitly a negative gender-related stereotype did not appear to have a significant detrimental impact on gameplay performance or gameplay-related attitudes. Additionally, gameplay performance was not affected significantly by manipulating the gender of the gaming avatar. These findings suggest that, although females appear to be knowledgeable about negative gender-gaming stereotypes, these might not impact performance. Moreover, females tend not to endorse these beliefs as a true reflection of their gaming ability, representing a positive finding in view of the prevailing negative attitudes they face in gaming domains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Do children need humans or screen? Institutional-based cross-sectional study
IS  - 3
VL  - 52
AB  - Introduction: Screen exposure is on the rise and has been virtually unavoidable in the post-Covid era. Screen exposure during the critical period of brain development results in delayed language, learning and behaviour problems and subsequent sedentary lifestyle results in non-communicable disease later in life. Objectives: To assess the burden of digital screen exposure and parental perceptions of its effects in children. Method: This institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged 1-13 years in a tertiary healthcare centre in Puducherry, India, from April 2022 to June 2022. Data were collected using the Digital Screen Exposure Questionnaire (DSEQ), administered by trained Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship (CRRI) after pilot testing. Results: Our study shows that the prevalence of excessive screen exposure (>1 hour) was 25% during weekdays and 44.9% during weekends. The most common media used was television (TV) in 92.8%, closely followed by smart phones in 90%. Most frequently watched content (>5 times/ week) was random things for enjoyment in 57.8% followed by rhymes in 25.7%; 57.1% had no outside play during weekdays. Mother’s education was the main predictor which influenced the duration of screen exposure in study participants. Conclusions: Our study shows that the prevalence of excessive screen exposure (>1 hour) was 25% during weekdays and 44.9% during weekends. Common media used were TV in 92.8% and smart phones in 90%. Except for mother’s education, no other socio-demographic factor influenced the duration of screen exposure in study participants. There was excessive screen exposure in children despite parental perception of its harmful effects © (2023), (Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians). All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Does group size and blending matter? Impact of a digital mental health game implemented with refugees in various settings
IS  - 1
VL  - 18
AB  - Purpose: There is an urgent need to upscale accessible mental health (MH) interventions that address barriers to care among Syrian refugee adolescents. The Happy Helping Hand (HH) is an innovative, cognitive behavioral digital game designed to improve MH for adolescents across digital divides. This study aims to examine the impact of HH implemented among Syrian refugees who varied according to group size and face-to-face (F2F) versus digital contact. Design/methodology/approach: This mixed-methods study took place in Central Beqaa, Lebanon, from September 2020 to February 2021. Nine groups of Syrian displaced adolescents (n = 125) aged 13–17 years (Mage = 13.6 years) were recruited from an education center, two orphanages and one informal settlement to participate in the ten-session HH program. The WHO-Five-Well-being Index (WHO5) is a validated measure used to evaluate HH impact on MH at baseline and directly postintervention. Findings: Significant improvements were seen in WHO5 scores in F2F and digital settings from baseline to follow-up. At baseline, 28% reported normal well-being, which increased to 99% after HH participation. WHO5 scores changed from M = 59.4 at baseline, indicating depression, to M = 77.3 at follow-up, indicating normal well-being. Smaller groups with more F2F contact reported greater improvements in mean WHO5 than larger groups with less F2F contact. The greatest aggregate change in well-being was achieved when HH was implemented digitally in bigger groups. Originality/value: Study results indicate that the HH game can improve well-being and MH for Syrian refugees. Importantly, results build on the base of evidence on digital MH interventions as promising tools on the way to ensure healthy lives and well-being for all. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

IS  - 1
VL  - 11
AB  - COVID-19 prevention behaviors may be seen as self-interested or prosocial. Using American samples from MTurk and Prolific (total n = 6850), we investigated which framing is more effective—and motivation is stronger—for fostering prevention behavior intentions. We evaluated messaging that emphasized personal, public, or personal and public benefits of prevention. In initial studies (conducted March 14–16, 2020), the Public treatment was more effective than the Personal treatment, and no less effective than the Personal + Public treatment. In additional studies (conducted April 17–30, 2020), all three treatments were similarly effective. Across all these studies, the perceived public threat of coronavirus was also more strongly associated with prevention intentions than the perceived personal threat. Furthermore, people who behaved prosocially in incentivized economic games years before the pandemic had greater prevention intentions. Finally, in a field experiment (conducted December 21–23, 2020), we used our three messaging strategies to motivate contact-tracing app signups (n = 152,556 newsletter subscribers). The design of this experiment prevents strong causal inference; however, the results provide suggestive evidence that the Personal + Public treatment may have been more effective than the Personal or Public treatment. Together, our results highlight the importance of prosocial motives for COVID-19 prevention. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Do Women in Nepal Like Playing a Mobile Game? MANTRA: A Mobile Gamified App for Improving Healthcare Seeking Behavior in Rural Nepal
VL  - 9
AB  - In Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC), one of the causes of maternal and child mortality is a lack of medical knowledge and consequently the inability to seek timely healthcare. Mobile health (mHealth) technology is gradually becoming a universal intervention platform across the globe due to ubiquity of mobile phones and network coverage. MANTRA is a novel mHealth intervention developed to tackle maternal and child health issues through a serious mobile game app in rural Nepal, which demonstrated a statistically significant knowledge improvement in rural women. This paper explores the perceptions and usability of the MANTRA app amongst rural women and Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) in Nepal. Despite the challenges of a target user group with limited educational levels and low smartphone experience, all participants viewed the MANTRA app with approval and enthusiasm. They were willing to engage further with the mHealth intervention and to share their experience and knowledge with fellow community members. Participants also showed an increase in awareness of danger signs enabling them to make better informed health decisions in the future. FCHVs viewed the app as a validation tool providing and support for greater impact of their efforts in rural Nepal. Growing mobile ownership, network coverage and availability of smartphones along with acceptance of the prototype MANTRA app in rural communities suggest encouraging prospects for mHealth interventions to be incorporated in the national health infrastructure in Nepal and other LMICs. © Copyright © 2021 Kayastha, Mueller, Yadav, Kelman, Boscor, Saville, Arjyal, Baral, Fordham, Hearn and Kostkova.

TI  - Educate your avatar, educate your mind: motivating learning through play
AB  - Students, that are currently receiving an education have grown up not knowing a life without technology such as computers, the internet, mobile phones and online games. They use this technology to communicate with each other, connect with the world, research information, not only for the purpose of bettering themselves but to also establish themselves in the world. Much has been written about how technology can be an influence in todays adolescence and how it can, potentially, improve their way of life. A Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) is an example of such a technology that is being considered as an alternative means of teaching todays youth as being able to having them actively participating in their education instead of being bored and uninspired. Motivation is a key factor that propels us in life. It plays a major role in nearly everything we do. Without motivation, we would simply not care about outcomes in our lives resulting in failure in what we do in all walks of life, such as education and employment. This paper looks at how online gameplay might assist in developing engaging education resources.

TI  - Educators' Perspectives on Integrating Technology Into Sexual Health
Education: Implementation Study
IS  - 1
VL  - 9
AB  - Background: In the last decade, the use of technology-based sexual
health education has increased. Multiple studies have shown the
feasibility of technology-based interventions, while a subset has also
shown efficacy in improving youths' sexual health outcomes such as
increased condom use and knowledge. However, little is known about
health educators' experiences in integrating technology to augment
sexual health curricula.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the perceptions and
experiences of health educators regarding the incorporation of
technology into a sexual health education program designed for
underserved youth in Fresno County, California, and to identify
facilitators and challenges to incorporating technology into the
in-person curriculum.
Methods: This implementation study used data collected as part of a
cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate In the Know (ITK), an
in-person sexual health education curriculum that includes
technology-based content, such as a resource locator, videos, and games,
which can be accessed through a mobile app or website. Data from
implementation logs from each cohort (n=51) and annual interviews (n=8)
with health educators were analyzed to assess the health educators'
experiences using the technology and adaptations made during the
implementation.
Results: The health educators reported that technological issues
affected implementation to some degree: 87\% of the time in the first
year, which decreased to 47\% in the third year as health educators'
familiarity with the app increased and functionality improved.
Technology issues were also more common in non-school settings.
Successes and challenges in 3 domains emerged: managing technology,
usability of the ITK app, and youth engagement. The health educators
generally had positive comments about the app and youth engagement with
the technology-based content and activities; however, they also noted
certain barriers to adolescents' use of the mobile app including limited
data storage and battery life on mobile phones.
Conclusions: Health educators require training and support to optimize
technology as a resource for engaging with youth and providing sensitive
information. Although technology is often presented as a solution to
reach underserved populations, educational programs should consider the
technological needs and limitations of the participants, educators, and
settings.

TI  - Effectiveness and moderators of a multicomponent school-based
intervention on screen time devices: the <i>Movimente</i>
cluster-randomized controlled trial
IS  - 1
VL  - 21
AB  - Background Interventions targeting reduce screen time in adolescents are
urgently needed, mainly in low and middle-income countries because of
the lack of evidence. Thus, the aims of the study were to examine the
effect of a cluster-randomized controlled trial on screen time (ST)
devices among Brazilian adolescents and to identify possible moderators.
Methods Movimente was a multicomponent school-based intervention that
was performed in 2017 and consisted of teacher training, education
curriculum, and environmental improvements. Baseline and
post-intervention assessments (over one academic year) were conducted
with students aged 10-16 years at baseline (baseline n = 921, {[}n = 538
intervention group; n = 383 control group]). A self-report questionnaire
was used to measure daily minutes of device specific screen time (TV,
computer, video games and smartphone) and demographic variables. Linear
mixed models were used to examine intervention effects and an
exploratory moderation analysis (sex, grade and socioeconomic status)
was performed. Results The intervention had no significant effects on TV
time (beta = - 6.4, 95\% CI: - 6.1;13.4), game time (beta = - 8.2, 95\%
CI: - 7.2;10.8), computer time (beta = 1.1, 95\% CI: - 6.3;18.5),
smartphone time (beta = - 10.2, 95\% CI: - 32.5;12.1), screen time (beta
= - 12.8, 95\% CI: - 50.5;24.8), meeting screen time guidelines (OR:
1.29, 95\% CI: 0.65,2.57) and meeting screen time guidelines with
smartphone (OR: 1.66, 95\% CI: 0.37,7.40). There was a significant
intervention effect on reducing TV time (beta = - 37.1, 95\% CI: - 73.0,
- 1.3) among 8th grade students only. Conclusions The Movimente
intervention was effective only for TV time among 8th grade students.
Understanding how school-based interventions can improve adolescents'
device specific screen time across age groups is needed. Future
strategies should cover all screen-based devices. Further, there is a
need for more studies in low- and-middle income countries to assist in
the development of effective strategies.

TI  - Effectiveness of a mobile app-based educational intervention to treat internet gaming disorder among Iranian adolescents: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
IS  - 1
VL  - 23
AB  - Background: The use of video games, a hobby for many teenagers in their leisure time, has brought with it a new potential for concerns. Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is a mental condition classified as a disorder due to addictive behaviors. It may include use of video games, both online and offline. Consequences of IGD may include introversion, social anxiety, mood swings, loneliness, sleep problems, behavioral problems, depression, low self-esteem, and increased violence. In order to design an app-based intervention for adolescents, a transtheoretical model (TTM) has been used. This widely used model in the field of behavioral change is also practical for health education programs. In addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used to make people more aware of their behaviors, feelings and thoughts and how to achieve behavioral change. The present study seeks to determine the effectiveness of this app-based intervention in in the treatment of IGD among adolescents. Method: In this single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 206 high-school adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in Qazvin city will be recruited. Eligible adolescents will be randomly assigned into intervention and control groups. Eight consecutive sessions delivered over 2 months and based on the TTM and CBT will be delivered through the `app (named HAPPYTEEN) to the intervention group. The control group will receive a sleep hygiene intervention (8 consecutive sessions for 2 months) via the app. Data collection tools include the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales, Stages of Change Questionnaire, Decision Balance, and Self-Efficacy. The study measures will be completed at baseline, post intervention, and 1 month and 3 months after the intervention. Discussion: The results of this intervention could be used as adjunct therapy for adolescents with IGD. Trial registration: Clinical Trial Registration Center of Iran (IRCT) IRCT20181226042140N1.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Peer-Led Web-Based Intervention to Improve General
Self-Efficacy in Using Dating Apps Among Young Adults: Randomized
Clustered Trial
IS  - 10
VL  - 22
AB  - Background: Online dating apps are popular platforms for seeking romance
and sexual relationships among young adults. As mobile apps can easily
gain access to a pool of strangers ({''}new friends{''}) at any time and
place, it leads to heightened sexual health risks and privacy concerns.
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-led
web-based intervention for online dating apps to prepare Chinese college
students so that they have better self-efficacy when using dating apps.
Methods: An open clustered randomized controlled trial was conducted
among students from three colleges (The University of Hong Kong, Hang
Seng University of Hong Kong, and Yijin Programme of Vocational Training
College) in Hong Kong. Students aged 17 to 27 years who attended common
core curriculum or general education were randomized into intervention
and control groups. The intervention material, developed with high peer
engagement, included four short videos, an interactive scenario game,
and a risk assessment tool. An existing website promoting physical
activities and healthy living was used as a control. Using the
information, motivation, and behavioral skills (IMB) approach to design
the evaluation, questionnaires covering participants' sociodemographics
and dating app characteristics, as well as the general self-efficacy
scale (GSE) as the primary outcome and the risk propensity scale (RPS)
as the secondary outcome were administered before, immediately after,
and at 1 month after the intervention. Intention-to-treat analysis was
adopted, and between-group differences were assessed using the
Mann-Whitney U test. A post-hoc multiple linear regression model was
used to examine the correlates of the GSE and RPS.
Results: A total of 578 eligible participants (290 in the intervention
group and 288 in the control group) participated in the study with 36
lost to follow-up. There were more female participants (318/542, 58.7\%)
than male participants in the sample, reflecting the distribution of
college students. Over half of the participants (286/542, 52.8\%)
reported the following reasons for using dating apps: being curious
(170/498, 34.1\%), trying to make new friends (158/498, 31.7\%), and
finding friends with similar interests (121/498, 24.3\%). Overall, the
participants in the intervention group reported favorable experiences
when compared with the finding in the control group. There was
significant improvement in the GSE score and reduction in the RPS score
(P<.001) in the intervention group. University of Hong Kong students
were more susceptible to risk reduction after the intervention when
compared with students from the other two institutions.
Conclusions: The online intervention was effective in improving general
self-efficacy and reducing risk tendency among young students. Future
work is needed to determine if this approach is cost-effective and such
behavioral change is sustainable.

TI  - Effect of augmented reality game Pokemon GO on cognitive performance and
emotional intelligence in adolescent young
VL  - 116
AB  - The main aim was to analyse the effect of 8 weeks of Pokemon GO on
cognitive performance (memory, selective attention, concentration,
mathematical calculation and linguistic reasoning) and emotional
intelligence (well-being, self-control, emotionality and sociability) in
Spanish adolescents between 12 and 15 years. A longitudinal design was
used, with a Control Group (n = 103) that did not use Pokemon GO, and
Experimental Group (n = 87) that used Pokemon GO during 8 weeks. Age,
sex, BMI, maternal educational level, number of computers at home and
moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were used as confounders.
Results showed that players walked 54 km and spent 40 min/day playing in
this period. Boys played more, won more points and reached a higher
level in the game than girls. The players playing Pokemon GO
significantly increased their selective attention (p = 0.003),
concentration levels (p < 0.001), and sociability levels (p = 0.003)
against their peers. It is concluded that Pokemon GO increases, in a
playful way, the amount of daily exercise in adolescents, could
positively affect their cognitive performance, and improve the social
relationships. Further studies are required to perform comparisons
between single and collaborative play and to identify the pedagogical
benefits through some subjects such as Physical Education. (C) 2017

TI  - Effect of exposure to gun violence in video games on children's dangerous behavior with real guns a randomized clinical trial
IS  - 5
VL  - 2
AB  - IMPORTANCE Among resource-rich countries, the United States has the highest rate of child mortality by unintentional firearm use. OBJECTIVE To test whether children's exposure to violent video games increases dangerous behavior around firearms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was set in a university laboratory and included pairs of children aged 8 to 12 years who knew each other. Of 313 participants who signed up, 250 were tested (2 arrived without partners, 61 did not arrive to participate). Of the 250 children tested, 8 were excluded (2 did not complete the study, 2 had participated in a related study, and 4 were outliers). Each child was paid $25. Data were collected July 1, 2017, to July 31, 2018. INTERVENTIONS In a 3-group randomized design, pairs of children played or watched 1 of 3 versions of the game Minecraft for 20 minutes: (1) violent with guns, (2) violent with swords, or (3) nonviolent. The pairs of children were then placed in a different room and were told they could play with toys and games for 20 minutes. A cabinet in the room contained 2 hidden disabled handguns with counters for trigger pulls. Play sessions were videotaped. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Main outcomes were touching a handgun, seconds spent holding a handgun, and number of trigger pulls (including at oneself or the partner). Control variables included sex, age, trait aggressiveness, exposure to violent media, attitudes toward guns, presence of firearms in the home, interest in firearms, and whether the child had taken a firearm safety course. RESULTS Of 242 participants, 220 children (mean [SD] age, 9.9 [1.4] years; 129 [58.6%] boys) found a gun andwere included in analysis. Among the 76 children who played the video game that included gun violence, 47 children (61.8%) touched a handgun. Among the 74 children who played the video game that included sword violence, 42 (56.8%) touched a handgun. Among the 70 children who played the nonviolent video game, 31 (44.3%) touched a handgun. Participants who played a violent version of the gamewere more likely to shoot at themselves or their partners than those who played a nonviolent game. Other risk factors for dangerous behavior around firearms included selfreported habitual exposure to violent media and trait aggressiveness. Self-reported exposure to violent media was positively associated with total trigger pulls (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.00-1.98) and trigger pulls at oneself or one's partner (IRR, 1.88; 95%CI, 1.29-2.72). Trait aggression was positively associated with total trigger pulls (IRR, 13.52; 95%CI, 3.14-58.29), trigger pulls at oneself or one's partner (IRR, 25.69; 95%CI, 5.92-111.39), and time spent holding a handgun (IRR, 4.22; 95%CI, 1.62-11.02). One protective factor was having taken a firearm safety training course.

TI  - Effect of the frustration of psychological needs on addictive behaviors in mobile videogamers—The mediating role of use expectancies and time spent gaming
IS  - 17
VL  - 17
AB  - Casual videogames (CVGs), played on smartphones, are becoming increasingly popular, especially among females and adults. Whereas the addictive potential of online (computer) videogames is well-established, there is yet insufficient evidence for Internet gaming disorder (IGD) in mobile gamers and for the mediating role of some mechanisms involved. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the frustration of psychological needs on mobile videogamers’ addictive behavior as well as the role of cognitions (game-use expectancies) and behaviors (time spent playing) through a hypothesized serial mediation model, while controlling for important correlates, such as game genre, age, gender and payment during play. A total of 471 mobile game users (211 males) with an average age of 21.73 replied to an online survey containing sociodemographic and game variables, the Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale (NSFS), the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form (IGDS9-SF) and a slightly modified version of the Internet Use Expectancies Scale (IUES). The results corroborate the negative effects of need frustration on IGD among mobile gamers and clarify the role of time spent playing and game-use expectancies in the development of IGD, highlighting the important role of cognitions in this relationship. We conclude that both the time spent playing and game-use expectancies should be important targets for clinical interventions, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Effects of culture on the pre-production design of the HIV Game
AB  - In this paper we documented the pre-production design process of "The HIV Game," an interactive serious game with cultural and sociotechnological implications for youths living in the Yucatan. Students at Purdue University's IDeaLaboratory are researching, designing, and developing the Flash animation game, which will be delivered via the Internet in Cyber Caf\'{e}s set up in four third-world villages in the Yucatan. The design process combines knowledge and measures from user-centered design, serious play theory, sociotechnology, cultural implications, interactive media design, gaming, usability engineering, healthcare, and cognitive learning. While no single area is new, it is a novel approach to understanding and developing new ways of using interactive media to measure and change healthcare behavior of the Mayans and Mexicans living with HIV/AIDS in the Yucatan, and to prevent future spreading of the disease. The demographic research on the Mayan culture and the perceptions of technology survey that was implemented summer 2008 by Dr. La Verne Abe Harris, was used for the foundation of the pre-production design of "The HIV Game."

TI  - Effects of self-conscious emotions on affective and behavioral responses in HCI and CMC
AB  - It remains unsettled whether the design of humanlike interfaces is the gold standard in HCI. This study tested how the degree of humanness of the interfaces and the perceived interactants (HCI vs. CMC) might impact individuals' affective and behavioral responses in text-based interactions of a trivia game. The results showed that although users liked the computer agent more than the "other person," human-like representation, as manipulated by self-conscious emotions, only affected likability in the CMC context. And the "machine-like" interface actually appeared more expert. Our findings suggest humanlike interfaces should be applied with caution and within the right context. Important implications for user experience, as well as design for including emotions in HCI are discussed.

TI  - Effects of the augmented reality game Pokemon GO on fitness and fatness
in secondary school students
IS  - 1
VL  - 81
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of 8 weeks of
Pokemon GO on physical fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness {[}CRF],
Speed/Agility {[}S/A], and muscular strength {[}MS]) and fatness (body
mass index {[}BMI], percentage of body fat {[}\%BF], and waist-hip
index), as well as possible differences between weekly physical activity
(PA) levels, in Spanish adolescents between 12 and 15 years of age.
Design, setting and method: Comparative design, with a control group (n
= 86) that did not participate in Pokemon GO, and an intervention group
(n = 78) which did so over an 8-week period. Age, sex, number of home
computers, and maternal educational level were controlled for as
possible confounding variables. Results: Results show that players
walked a total of 52 km in 8 weeks. Moreover, they played the game for a
mean of 40 min/day. Pokemon GO players showed improvements in CRF and
BMI (p < .05). Inactive young people showed a 22.2\% increase in CRF and
an 11.3\% decrease in their \%BF compared to non-players. Despite these
results, less than half of the participants considered that Pokemon GO
had improved their overall fitness and felt more encouraged to engage in
PA. Conclusion: Pokemon GO increased PA and CRF levels and decreased BMI
and \%BF after 8 weeks of practice independently of age, sex, number of
computers at home, and maternal education. The Pokemon GO app could be
used in school and family contexts to increase the daily amount of MVPA,
improve CRF, and to take advantage of the effects of loss of body fat.

TI  - Efficacy of educational video game versus traditional educational apps at improving physician decision making in trauma triage: Randomized controlled trial
VL  - 359
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a behavioral intervention delivered through a video game can improve the appropriateness of trauma triage decisions in the emergency department of non-trauma centers. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Online intervention in national sample of emergency medicine physicians who make triage decisions at US hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 368 emergency medicine physicians primarily working at non-trauma centers. A random sample (n=200) of those with primary outcome data was reassessed at six months. INTERVENTIONS: Physicians were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one hour of exposure to an adventure video game (Night Shift) or apps based on traditional didactic education (myATLS and Trauma Life Support MCQ Review), both on iPads. Night Shift was developed to recalibrate the process of using pattern recognition to recognize moderate-severe injuries (representativeness heuristics) through the use of stories to promote behavior change (narrative engagement). Physicians were randomized with a 2×2 factorial design to intervention (game v traditional education apps) and then to the experimental condition under which they completed the outcome assessment tool (low v high cognitive load). Blinding could not be maintained after allocation but group assignment was masked during the analysis phase. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes of a virtual simulation that included 10 cases; in four of these the patients had severe injuries. Participants completed the simulation within four weeks of their intervention. Decisions to admit, discharge, or transfer were measured. The proportion of patients under-triaged (patients with severe injuries not transferred to a trauma center) was calculated then (primary outcome) and again six months later, with a different set of cases (primary outcome of follow-up study). The secondary outcome was effect of cognitive load on under-triage. RESULTS: 149 (81%) physicians in the game arm and 148 (80%) in the traditional education arm completed the trial. Of these, 64/100 (64%) and 58/100 (58%), respectively, completed reassessment at six months. The mean age was 40 (SD 8.9), 283 (96%) were trained in emergency medicine, and 207 (70%) were ATLS (advanced trauma life support) certified. Physicians exposed to the game under-triaged fewer severely injured patients than those exposed to didactic education (316/596 (0.53) v 377/592 (0.64), estimated difference 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.16; P<0.001). Cognitive load did not influence under-triage (161/308 (0.53) v 155/288 (0.54) in the game arm; 197/300 (0.66) v 180/292 (0.62) in the traditional educational apps arm; P=0.66). At six months, physicians exposed to the game remained less likely to under-triage patients (146/256 (0.57) v 172/232 (0.74), estimated difference 0.17, 0.09 to 0.25; P<0.001). No physician reported side effects. The sample might not reflect all emergency medicine physicians, and a small set of cases was used to assess performance. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with apps based on traditional didactic education, exposure of physicians to a theoretically grounded video game improved triage decision making in a validated virtual simulation. Though the observed effect was large, the wide confidence intervals include the possibility of a small benefit, and the real world efficacy of this intervention remains uncertain. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

TI  - Efficacy of smartphone active and passive virtual reality distraction vs standard care on burn pain among pediatric patients a randomized clinical trial
IS  - 6
VL  - 4
AB  - IMPORTANCE It is unknown whether smartphone-based virtual reality (VR) games are effective in reducing pain among pediatric patients in real-world burn clinics. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of a smartphone VR game on dressing pain among pediatric patients with burns. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial included children aged 6 to 17 years who seen in the outpatient clinic of a large American Burn Association verified pediatric burn center and level I pediatric trauma center between December 30, 2016, and January 23, 2019. Speaking English as their primary language was an inclusion criterion. Intention-To-Treat data analyses were conducted from December 2019 to March 2020. INTERVENTIONS Active VR participants played a VR game; passive VR participants were immersed in the same VR environment without interactions. Both groupswere compared with a standard care group. One researcher administered VR and observed pain while another researcher administered a posttrial survey that measured the childs perceived pain and VR experience. Nurses were asked to report the clinical utility. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patients self-reported pain using a visual analog scale (VAS; range, 0-100). A researcher observed patient pain based on the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability Revised (FLACC-R) scale. Nurses were asked to report VR helpfulness (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate more helpful) and ease of use (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate easier to use). RESULTS A total of 90 children (45 [50%] girls, mean age, 11.3 years [95%CI, 10.6-12.0 years]; 51 [57%] White children) participated. Most children had second-degree burns (81 [90%]). Participants in the active VR group had significantly lower reported overall pain (VAS score, 24.9 [95%CI, 12.2-37.6]) compared with participants in the standard care control group (VAS score, 47.1 [95%CI, 32.1-62.2]; P = .02). The active VR group also had a lower worst pain score (VAS score, 27.4 [95%CI, 14.7-40.1]) than both the passive VR group (VAS score, 47.9 [95%CI, 31.8-63.9]; P = .04) and the standard care group (VAS score, 48.8 [95%CI, 31.1-64.4]; P = .03). Simulator sickness scores (range, 0-60; lower scores indicate less sickness) were similar for active VR (19.3 [95%CI, 17.5-21.1]) and passive VR groups (19.5 [95%CI, 17.6-21.5]). Nurses also reported that the VR games could be easily implemented in clinics (helpfulness, active VR: 84.2; 95%CI, 74.5-93.8; passive VR: 76.9; 95%CI, 65.2-88.7; ease of use, active VR: 94.8, 95%CI, 91.8-97.8; passive VR: 96.0, 95%CI, 92.9-99.1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, a smartphone VR game was effective in reducing patient self-reported pain during burn dressing changes, suggesting that VR may be an effective method for managing pediatric burn pain. © 2021 American Medical Association.

TI  - Ehealth technologies to support nutrition and physical activity behaviors in diabetes self-management
VL  - 9
AB  - Diabetes is a chronic, complex condition requiring sound knowledge and self-management skills to optimize glycemic control and health outcomes. Dietary intake and physical activity are key diabetes self-management (DSM) behaviors that require tailored education and support. Electronic health (eHealth) technologies have a demonstrated potential for assisting individuals with DSM behaviors. This review provides examples of technologies used to support nutrition and physical activity behaviors in the context of DSM. Technologies covered include those widely used for DSM, such as web-based programs and mobile phone and smartphone applications. In addition, examples of novel tools such as virtual and augmented reality, video games, computer vision for dietary carbohydrate monitoring, and wearable devices are provided. The challenges to, and facilitators for, the use of eHealth technologies in DSM are discussed. Strategies to support the implementation of eHealth technologies within practice and suggestions for future research to enhance nutrition and physical activity behaviors as a part of broader DSM are provided. © 2016 Rollo et al.

TI  - Embedded Game Design as a Method for Addressing Social Determinants of Health
IS  - 3
VL  - 13
AB  - This paper, describes the design, development, and evaluation of The Test, a theory-based mobile game prototype designed to promote HIV testing by providing information and influencing motivations, and behavioral intentions among YMSM. The Test was designed using embedded design, first described by Kaufman & Flanagan (2015), which diverges from traditional “educational game” design strategies by mixing on-message content with nonfocal content, in an attempt to make the overall experience more approachable and engaging. One challenge of embedded design is that it targets attitudes and actions that are not always proximate to a particular behavior. Games with embedded content forgo explicit takeaways, and their possible distal effects present a challenge to traditional tests of efficacy. The benefit of embedded design, however, is that its holistic or ecological design approach (which considers feelings, emotions, affects, social relations, and connections to broader communities) stands in close alignment with the social-ecological model. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Empowerment and Well-Being Through Participatory Action Research and Accessible Gaming: A Case Study With Adults With Intellectual Disability
VL  - 7
AB  - Although the potential of games to foster learning, representation, empowerment, well-being, and social inclusion is already documented, some groups seem to remain underrepresented. In the field of disability, this potential is still immersed in a set of barriers and hindrances, arising from the lack of accessibility of this medium and the lack of representation of voices in research and development processes. This problem seems to be exponentiated in the field of Intellectual Disability (ID). The present study describes insights from a case study developed with 14 institutionalized adults with severe ID, with two complementary aims: (a) explore the effectiveness of a PAR gaming approach in the empowerment and well-being of adults with ID living in an institutional setting; and (b) explore the feasibility of promoting accessibility in games through PAR. The proposed intervention included the development of games by higher education students for these individuals, with their active participation in all phases – conceptual definition, game design, game development, and playtesting. A total of 38 playtesting sessions and 162 gaming sessions were conducted, where systematic observation grids were filled, and pre and post-process assessments were conducted, targeting variables related to empowerment and well-being. The obtained results sustain this type of action-research design as a feasible strategy to empower people with ID and foster their well-being, through games as a form of expression and not only therapy. It also reflects on accessibility improvement through the presence of underrepresented groups (people with ID particularly) in the media creation processes that can, per se, be considered a form of empowerment. These insights also open a discussion about a potential paradigm shift toward a social model of accessibility aligned with the current views on the field of disability studies. Future studies should replicate this methodology with larger samples and in a context not aligned with the pandemic isolation. Furthermore, PAR must also be explored from a more general perspective, as a strategy to promote accessibility and participation in other media and cultural products as a whole.

TI  - Empower to connect and connect to empower: Experience in using a humanistic approach to improve patients' access to, and experience of, care in isolation wards during the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore
IS  - 1
VL  - 10
AB  - Patients admitted to the isolation ward during the COVID-19 outbreak face multiple psychosocial stressors including the disruptive experience of being in quarantine, anxiety over contracting a newly emerging infectious disease and limited access to their healthcare team. This quality improvement project aims to leverage on technology to improve patients' access to, and experience of, care while in isolation. Patients admitted to two isolation wards in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) between 28 February and 19 March 2020 were each provided an iPad loaded with the MyCare application (app), curated materials and mobile games. During this period, 83 of them accessed the device and the app. MyCare app is an app developed by the nursing team in SGH as part of an existing interprofessional collaboration to help patients navigate their care during their inpatient stay. In response to COVID-19, MyCare app was supplemented with materials to address affected patients' informational and psychosocial needs. These materials included an information sheet on COVID-19, interviews with previous severe acute respiratory syndrome survivors, psychosocial support materials, and uplifting literature, illustrated storybooks and artwork. This paper describes the process of planning for, and executing, the intervention and reports the initial results of its effect. Initial feedback indicated a positive response to the intervention. 9 out of 10 respondents (90%) rated their hospital experience with a maximum of five stars and all 10 respondents (100%) rated the psychosocial support materials with five stars. Doctors managing the patients also observed a reduction in the number of commonly asked questions following the deployment of the iPad. This quality improvement project is ongoing with plans for further research to determine how to better support the psychosocial needs of patients in isolation during a novel disease outbreak.

TI  - Engaging adolescents in a computer-based weight management program: Avatars and virtual coaches could help
IS  - 1
VL  - 23
AB  - Objective This research focuses on the potential ability of animated avatars (a digital representation of the user) and virtual agents (a digital representation of a coach, buddy, or teacher) to deliver computer-based interventions for adolescents' chronic weight management. An exploration of the acceptance and desire of teens to interact with avatars and virtual agents for self-management and behavioral modification was undertaken. Materials and Methods The utilized approach was inspired by community-based participatory research. Data was collected from 2 phases: Phase 1) focus groups with teens, provider interviews, parent interviews; and Phase 2) mid-range prototype assessment by teens and providers. Results Data from all stakeholder groups expressed great interest in avatars and virtual agents assisting self-management efforts. Adolescents felt the avatars and virtual agents could: 1) reinforce guidance and support, 2) fit within their lifestyle, and 3) help set future goals, particularly after witnessing the effect of their current behavior(s) on the projected physical appearance (external and internal organs) of avatars. Teens wanted 2 virtual characters: A virtual agent to act as a coach or teacher and an avatar (extension of themselves) to serve as a "buddy" for empathic support and guidance and as a surrogate for rewards. Preferred modalities for use include both mobile devices to accommodate access and desktop to accommodate preferences for maximum screen real estate to support virtualization of functions that are more contemplative and complex (e.g., goal setting). Adolescents expressed a desire for limited co-user access, which they could regulate. Data revealed certain barriers and facilitators that could affect adoption and use. Discussion The current study extends the support of teens, parents, and providers for adding avatars or virtual agents to traditional computerbased interactions. Data supports the desire for a personal relationship with a virtual character in support of previous studies. The study provides a foundation for further work in the area of avatar-driven motivational interviewing. Conclusions This study provides evidence supporting the use of avatars and virtual agents, designed using participatory approaches, to be included in the continuum of care. Increased probability of engagement and long-term retention of overweight, obese adolescent users and suggests expanding current chronic care models toward more comprehensive, socio-technical representations. © The Author 2015.

TI  - Engaging African American Youth in the Development of a Serious Mobile
Game for Sexual Health Education: Mixed Methods Study
IS  - 1
VL  - 8
AB  - Background: Although teen pregnancy rates decreased dramatically in the
United States over the past decade, the rates of sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) among adolescents and young adults increased. STI
rates disproportionately affect African American youth and young adults.
Innovative, accessible, and culturally relevant sexual health
interventions are urgently needed.
Objective: This study aimed to identify the optimal modality for a
game-based sexual health intervention; develop the educational,
entertainment, and technological aspects of the serious game; and
demonstrate its usability and acceptance by the target population.
Methods: This project was grounded in formative data collection with
community-based participatory research principles and practices combined
with a user-centered design and development approach. Sexually Active
Adolescent-Focused Education (SAAFE) was developed using input and
feedback from African American youths aged 15 to 21 years who
participated in a youth advisory board and focus group discussions to
inform the co-design and cocreation of the serious game. The process was
highly iterative with multiple sessions for user input following design
changes. It proceeded in 3 stages. Social cognitive theory and
problem-solving theory were leveraged to provide evidence-based,
trauma-informed education through a serious game. Usability testing
assessed the quality of user experience with the prototype.
Results: Across all 3 stages, a total of 86 self-identified African
American males and females aged 15 to 21 years from the District of
Columbia and Birmingham, Alabama, participated. Participants requested a
dating simulation game. They wanted SAAFE to be customizable, realistic,
entertaining, educational, modern, and experiential, linking
consequences to their gameplay decisions. Usability testing resulted in
an initial System Usability Survey score of 77.7, placing the game in
the 82nd percentile and above average for usability.
Conclusions: Initial results suggest that the SAAFE prototype is a
promising intervention to engage African American youth in sexual health
education using a role-playing game. If proven efficacious, the game has
the potential to meet the need for sex education, counterbalance
unhealthy portrayals of sex in popular media, and respond to the
disparities in the STI epidemic.

TI  - Engaging Victims of Child Sex Trafficking: Training for Child Welfare Workers
IS  - 3
VL  - 47
AB  - Child sex trafficking (CST) is the exploitation through commercial sex of a minor under 18. Federal law requires state child welfare agencies to respond and provide services to victims of CST. Social workers report lacking an understanding of state and federal law related to human trafficking, as well as resources for victims, and are often inadequately trained for identifying and serving survivors. As part of a CST awareness training including lecture, discussion, and game-based learning, child welfare workers were surveyed on their knowledge about CST and their self-efficacy in serving and engaging with survivors. Regression analyses showed that the training was associated with a positive change from pre- to posttest, on both knowledge (R2 =. 472) and self-efficacy (R2 =.381), even when controlling for gender, race, experience, pretest knowledge, and position. Interactive trainings for child welfare workers on child trafficking survivor engagement that use a victim-centered, strengths-based lens are a promising practice. © 2023 National Association of Social Workers.

TI  - Engaging young people in the co-design of a brand and online platform for a public health organization
IS  - 2
VL  - 6
AB  - This article explores how co-design was used to engage young people in the design of a new brand identity and online platform for the Auckland District Health Board’s Peer Sexuality Support Programme (PSSP). Unlike conventional branding practices that do not generally engage users as co-creators in the early discovery stages of the design process, in this research young people were brought into the design process as informants and co-designers. This drove both brand strategy and touchpoint design, positioning the brand to be better accepted by the young people involved in the programme. A series of discovery and evaluation co-design workshops, with a diverse range of PSSP youth leaders, offered game-like interactive activities and the opportunity for open discussions. Engaging young people in fun and meaningful ways helped them uncover and share insights that could only be possible by directly involving them in the design process. The outputs of this co-designed brand – FRANK – incorporated a full visual identity and a proposal for an online platform. The final brand design elicited strong positive responses from PSSP youth leaders, highlighting the importance of involving young people in the design of products and services that address issues affecting them. © 2020, Intellect Ltd..

TI  - Enhancing instructional outcomes with a serious gamified system: a
qualitative investigation of student perceptions
IS  - 5-6
VL  - 122
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to evaluate the students' perception of their
learning experiences concerning serious gaming and gamification
instructions and determines whether they were motivated enough and
engaged during the educative process in a resource-poor context.
Moreover, the study evaluated the impact of interactive instructional
environment outcomes in terms of students' perceptions of the learning
catalysed by gamified systems, particularly in enhancing attitude change
coupled with knowledge acquisition.
Design/methodology/approach - This study used a qualitative research
design technique to collect the data. A total of 108 first year
secondary school students participated in a sexual health literacy
course that lasted for a five-week learning period. Using a
Cluster-sampling technique, three classes were randomly ` assigned to
serious gaming, gamification and teacher-centred instructions.
Individual face-to-face interviews were used to assess students'
perceives required satisfaction with three instructions. Data were
audio-recorded, and coding analysis was used using NVivo software
facilitated qualitative data analysis.
Findings - The results show that serious gaming and gamification
instructions trumped the traditional teacher-centred instruction method.
While intervention students were all positive about the serious gaming
and gamification instructions, non-intervention students were negative
about conservative teacher-centered learning whose limited interactivity
also undermined learning relative to the two innovative interventions.
Research limitations/implications - As a justification to limit
face-to-face classes. this study may be useful during an emergency
phenomenon, including the current situation of amid COVID-19. The
implementation of serious gaming and gamilication as remotely
instructional options could be among the measures to protect educational
communities through reducing close-proximity, and eventually, control
contamination and the spread of viruses.
Originality/value - The application of serious gaming and game elements
should not be conceptualised as universal but context-specific. This
study shows that particularism is essential to optimise the results in
terms of coming up with a specific design based on the scope of
evaluation for positive results and develop an intervention that will
work, especially in the resource-poor context of the developing world.

TI  - Enhancing Men's Awareness of Testicular Diseases (E-MAT) using virtual
reality: A randomised pilot feasibility study and mixed method process
evaluation
IS  - 7
VL  - 19
AB  - Introduction Testicular cancer is among the most common malignancies in
men under the age of 50 years. Most testicular symptoms are linked to
benign diseases. Men's awareness of testicular diseases and testicular
self-examination behaviours are suboptimal. In this pilot feasibility
study and process evaluation we examine the feasibility of conducting a
future definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the effect
of the Enhancing Men's Awareness of Testicular Diseases using Virtual
Reality intervention (E-MATVR) compared to the Enhancing Men's Awareness
of Testicular Diseases using Electric information control (E-MATE). The
study protocol is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05146466).Methods
Male athletes, engaged in Gaelic games, and aged 18 to 50 years were
included. Recruitment was via FacebookTM, XTM (formerly TwitterTM), and
posters. Participants were individually randomised to either E-MATVR or
E-MATE. Data were collected at baseline (T0), immediately post-test
(T1), and three months post-test (T2) using surveys. Qualitative
interviews were conducted with participants and researchers.Results Data
were collected from 74 participants. Of those, 66 were retained. All
E-MATVR participants and most E-MATE participants (n = 33, 89.2\%)
agreed/strongly agreed that the device was easy to use and that they
were engaged to learn by the device. Most E-MATVR participants (n = 34,
91.9\%) and all E-MATE participants agreed/strongly agreed that the time
it took them to complete the intervention was reasonable. All 74
participants were extremely satisfied/somewhat satisfied with their
overall participation in the study. E-MATVR was described as
interactive, easy, fun, and close to real life. Initial difficulty using
VR equipment, nausea, and technical issues were identified as challenges
to engaging with E-MATVR. Recommendations were made to make VR more
accessible, shorten the survey, and incorporate more interactivity.
Across all participants, mean testicular knowledge scores (range 0-1)
increased from 0.4 (SD 0.2) at T0 to 0.8 (SD 0.2) at T1. At T2, overall
mean scores for participants were 0.7 (SD 0.2). Mean knowledge scores
did not differ by trial arm at any timepoint. At T2, all E-MATVR
participants and 29/32 E-MATE participants (90.6\%) reported
purposefully examining their testes within the past three
months.Conclusion Findings are promising, highlighting the feasibility
of using VR to promote young athletes' awareness of testicular diseases.
Considering the strengths, limitations, and lessons learned from this
study, some modifications are required prior to conducing an RCT. These
include but are not limited to shortening survey questions,
incorporating more interactivity and visual content, and targeting more
heterogenous male-dominated environments.

TI  - Enhancing relationships through technology: Directions in parenting, caregiving, romantic partnerships, and clinical practice
IS  - 2
VL  - 22
AB  - Media coverage of research on phones and social media over the last decade has prompted widespread concern and one-size-fits-all guidance to limit screen time. Recognizing the limitations of screen time as a metric, researchers are now studying technology use in terms of affordances, individual differences, and longitudinal patterns. The current review examines technology use by parents, caregivers, couples, and clinicians. Individuals in these roles navigate risks, such as privacy violations, with benefits such as improved communication, empathy, and progress toward shared goals. Successful approaches vary by relationship type but have commonalities such as engaging with the technologies used by the other person to open up sensitive conversations, negotiate conflict, and illuminate patterns that would otherwise be hard to detect. To enhance relationships, some individuals depart from the intended use of technologies, for example, adapting connected devices for emotional communication or drawing on games to cope with social anxiety. One promising way in which individuals adapt technology to improve communication involves sharing technologies that were designed for personal use. This review highlights the importance of context, motivation, and the nuances of use to understand how technologies can be optimally used in personal and clinical relationships.  © 2019, AICH - Servier Group.

TI  - Enrichment effects on adult cognitive development: Can the functional capacity of older adults be preserved and enhanced?
IS  - 1
VL  - 9
AB  - In this monograph, we ask whether various kinds of intellectual, physical, and social activities produce cognitive enrichment effects - that is, whether they improve cognitive performance at different points of the adult life span, with a particular emphasis on old age. We begin with a theoretical framework that emphasizes the potential of behavior to influence levels of cognitive functioning. According to this framework, the undeniable presence of age-related decline in cognition does not invalidate the view that behavior can enhance cognitive functioning. Instead, the course of normal aging shapes a zone of possible functioning, which reflects person-specific endowments and age-related constraints. Individuals influence whether they function in the higher or lower ranges of this zone by engaging in or refraining from beneficial intellectual, physical, and social activities. From this point of view, the potential for positive change, or plasticity, is maintained in adult cognition. It is an argument that is supported by newer research in neuroscience showing neural plasticity in various aspects of central nervous system functioning, neurochemistry, and architecture. This view of human potential contrasts with static conceptions of cognition in old age, according to which decline in abilities is fixed and individuals cannot slow its course. Furthermore, any understanding of cognition as it occurs in everyday life must make a distinction between basic cognitive mechanisms and skills (such as working-memory capacity) and the functional use of cognition to achieve goals in specific situations. In practice, knowledge and expertise are critical for effective functioning, and the available evidence suggests that older adults effectively employ specific knowledge and expertise and can gain new knowledge when it is required. We conclude that, on balance, the available evidence favors the hypothesis that maintaining an intellectually engaged and physically active lifestyle promotes successful cognitive aging. First, cognitive-training studies have demonstrated that older adults can improve cognitive functioning when provided with intensive training in strategies that promote thinking and remembering. The early training literature suggested little transfer of function from specifically trained skills to new cognitive tasks; learning was highly specific to the cognitive processes targeted by training. Recently, however, a new generation of studies suggests that providing structured experience in situations demanding executive coordination of skills - such as complex video games, task-switching paradigms, and divided attention tasks-train strategic control over cognition that does show transfer to different task environments. These studies suggest that there is considerable reserve potential in older adults' cognition that can be enhanced through training. Second, a considerable number of studies indicate that maintaining a lifestyle that is intellectually stimulating predicts better maintenance of cognitive skills and is associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in late life. Our review focuses on longitudinal evidence of a connection between an active lifestyle and enhanced cognition, because such evidence admits fewer rival explanations of observed effects (or lack of effects) than does cross-sectional evidence. The longitudinal evidence consistently shows that engaging in intellectually stimulating activities is associated with better cognitive functioning at later points in time. Other studies show that meaningful social engagement is also predictive of better maintenance of cognitive functioning in old age. These longitudinal findings are also open to important rival explanations, but overall, the available evidence suggests that activities can postpone decline, attenuate decline, or provide prosthetic benefit in the face of normative cognitive decline, while at the same time indicating that late-life cognitive changes can result in curtailment of activities. Given the complexity of the dynamic reciprocal relationships between stimulating activities and cognitive function in old age, additional research will be needed to address the extent to which observed effects validate a causal influence of an intellectually engaged lifestyle on cognition. Nevertheless, the hypothesis that an active lifestyle that requires cognitive effort has long-term benefits for older adults' cognition is at least consistent with the available data. Furthermore, new intervention research that involves multimodal interventions focusing on goal-directed action requiring cognition (such as reading to children) and social interaction will help to address whether an active lifestyle enhances cognitive function. Third, there is a parallel literature suggesting that physical activity, and aerobic exercise in particular, enhances older adults' cognitive function. Unlike the literature on an active lifestyle, there is already an impressive array of work with humans and animal populations showing that exercise interventions have substantial benefits for cognitive function, particularly for aspects of fluid intelligence and executive function. Recent neuroscience research on this topic indicates that exercise has substantial effects on brain morphology and function, representing a plausible brain substrate for the observed effects of aerobic exercise and other activities on cognition. Our review identifies a number of areas where additional research is needed to address critical questions. For example, there is considerable epidemiological evidence that stress and chronic psychological distress are negatively associated with changes in cognition. In contrast, less is known about how positive attributes, such as selfefficacy, a sense of control, and a sense of meaning in life, might contribute to preservation of cognitive function in old age. It is well known that certain personality characteristics such as conscientiousness predict adherence to an exercise regimen, but we do not know whether these attributes are also relevant to predicting maintenance of cognitive function or effective compensation for cognitive decline when it occurs. Likewise, more information is needed on the factors that encourage maintenance of an active lifestyle in old age in the face of elevated risk for physiological decline, mechanical wear and tear on the body, and incidence of diseases with disabling consequences, and whether efforts to maintain an active lifestyle are associated with successful aging, both in terms of cognitive function and psychological and emotional well-being. We also discuss briefly some interesting issues for society and public policy regarding cognitive-enrichment effects. For example, should efforts to enhance cognitive function be included as part of a general prevention model for enhancing health and vitality in old age?We also comment on the recent trend of business marketing interventions claimed to build brain power and prevent age-related cognitive decline, and the desirability of direct research evidence to back claims of effectiveness for specific products. © 2009 Association for Psychological Science.

TI  - Epic Allies: Development of a Gaming App to Improve Antiretroviral
Therapy Adherence Among Young HIV-Positive Men Who Have Sex With Men
IS  - 1
VL  - 4
AB  - Background: In the United States, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
disproportionately affects young men who have sex with men (YMSM). For
HIV-positive individuals, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is
critical for achieving optimal health outcomes and reducing secondary
transmission of HIV. However, YMSM often struggle with ART adherence.
Novel mobile phone apps that incorporate game-based mechanics and social
networking elements represent a promising intervention approach for
improving ART adherence among YMSM.
Objective: This study used a multiphase, iterative development process
to create an ART adherence app for YMSM.
Methods: The three-phase development process included: (1) theory-based
concept development jointly by public health researchers and the
technology team, (2) assessment of the target population's ART adherence
needs and app preferences and development and testing of a clickable app
prototype, and (3) development and usability testing of the final app
prototype.
Results: The initial theory-based app concept developed in Phase One
included medication reminders, daily ART adherence tracking and
visualization, ART educational modules, limited virtual interactions
with other app users, and gamification elements. In Phase Two, adherence
needs, including those related to information, motivation, and
behavioral skills, were identified. Participants expressed preferences
for an ART adherence app that was informational, interactive, social,
and customizable. Based on the findings from Phase Two, additional
gaming features were added in Phase Three, including an interactive
battle, superhero app theme, and app storyline. Other features were
modified to increase interactivity and customization options and
integrate the game theme. During usability testing of the final
prototype, participants were able to understand and navigate the app
successfully and rated the app favorably.
Conclusions: An iterative development process was critical for the
development of an ART adherence game app that was viewed as highly
acceptable, relevant, and useful by YMSM.

TI  - Evaluation of a Novel Step Training Mobile App Intervention in Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation: A Single-Arm Prospective Cohort Study
IS  - 5
VL  - 11
AB  - Objective: To establish the usability, acceptability, safety, and exercise adherence of a step training mobile app. Design: A single-arm prospective cohort study. Setting: Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Australia. Subjects: Twenty-six cardiopulmonary rehabilitation participants. Intervention: Twelve weeks of step training using the mobile app Clock Yourself. Participants used Clock Yourself at home and during cardiopulmonary rehabilitation sessions, prescribed for a total of 15-20 minutes three times a week. Main Measures: The primary outcomes of interest were usability and acceptability and were measured using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Attitudes to Falls-Related Interventions Scale (AFRIS) questionnaire, respectively. Safety and adherence were measured by self-report and participant diary, respectively. Secondary outcomes measuring changes in stepping, gait, balance, and physical performance included Manual test of Choice Stepping Reaction Time (CSRT-M), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Gait speed with and without a cognitive dual task (DT) and Timed Up and Go with and without a cognitive DT (TUG and TUGcog). Results: Twenty-one participants completed the study. Clock Yourself was considered highly useable (SUS [median] = 82.5/100; interquartile range [IQR, 67.5-95], equating to an "A"rating [A-F scale]) and acceptable (AFRIS [median] = 38/42 [IQR, 31-41]). Participants practiced Clock Yourself for a median of 18.29 minutes per week and no adverse events were reported. At 12 weeks, mean change in CSRT-M, SPPB, gait speed, DT gait speed, TUG, and TUGcog were all statistically significant (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Twelve weeks of mobile app-based step training was safe and considered usable and acceptable by participants. On average, participants did not meet the prescribed practice dosage. Statistically significant changes were observed in all physical measures; however, results are confounded by participation in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and lack of control group.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

TI  - Evaluation of Recombinase Polymerase Amplification assay for monitoring
parasite load in patients with kala-azar and post kala-azar dermal
leishmaniasis
IS  - 4
VL  - 17
AB  - Author summaryVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar caused by the
digenetic parasite Leishmania donovani is a fatal form of leishmaniasis,
unless treated. In South Asia, approximately 10-20\% of apparently cured
cases of VL develop a dermal sequela termed post kala-azar dermal
leishmaniasis (PKDL). It presents with macular or papulonodular lesions
that harbour Leishmania parasites. Importantly, these cases of PKDL in
addition to asymptomatic and relapsed VL cases serve as mobile disease
reservoirs and sustain disease transmission. In macular PKDL, that
presently comprise over 50\% of cases, the diagnosis is particularly
challenging as parasites are often not detectable by microscopy.
Accordingly, development of strategies for molecular diagnosis is one of
the major foci of the ongoing leishmaniasis elimination programme
targeted for 2023, that aims to decrease the burden to <1/10,000 cases
of VL at the block/zilla level. Serological tests have limited
applicability when it is necessary to distinguish present from past
infection of VL, and in cases of PKDL when the positivity maybe due to a
past history of VL. An excellent option is the quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR) but limitations for its wider field applicability
include the high cost, technical expertise and time factor. Accordingly,
an urgent need exists for availability of field applicable molecular
tests. The RPA tested in this study could well be the desired
game-changer as it provided accurate diagnosis of VL and PKDL, can be
performed in a primary health centre, and demonstrated the potential to
be a monitoring tool for parasite load after treatment, that eventually
can accelerate achieving the end-goal of elimination of leishmaniasis.
BackgroundThe potential reservoirs of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in
South Asia include asymptomatic and relapsed cases of VL, along with
patients with post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). Accordingly,
accurate estimation of their parasite load is pivotal for ensuring
disease elimination, presently targeted for 2023. Serological tests
cannot accurately detect relapses and/or monitor treatment
effectiveness, and therefore, parasite antigen/nucleic acid based
detection assays remain the only viable option. An excellent option is
the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) but the high cost,
technical expertise and time involved precludes its wider acceptability.
Accordingly, the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay
operated in a mobile suitcase laboratory has emerged not simply as a
diagnostic tool for leishmaniasis but also to monitor the disease
burden. Methodology/Principal findingsUsing total genomic DNA isolated
from peripheral blood of confirmed VL cases (n = 40) and lesional
biopsies of PKDL cases (n = 64), the kinetoplast-DNA based qPCR and RPA
assay was performed and parasite load expressed as Cycle threshold (Ct)
and Time threshold (Tt) respectively. Using qPCR as the gold standard,
the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of RPA in naive cases of VL
and PKDL was reiterated. To assess the prognostic potential of the RPA,
samples were analyzed immediately at the end of treatment or >= 6 months
following completion of treatment. In cases of VL, the RPA assay in
terms of cure and detection of a relapse case showed 100\% concordance
with qPCR. In PKDL following completion of treatment, the overall
detection concordance between RPA and qPCR was 92.7\% (38/41). At the
end of treatment for PKDL, 7 cases remained qPCR positive, whereas RPA
was positive in only 4/7 cases, perhaps attributable to their low
parasite load. Conclusions/SignificanceThis study endorsed the potential
of RPA to evolve as a field applicable, molecular tool for monitoring
parasite load, possibly at a point of care level and is worthy of
consideration in resource limited settings.

TI  - Everyday, everywhere: Alcohol marketing and social media-current trends
IS  - 4
VL  - 47
AB  - Aims: To provide a snapshot content analysis of social media marketing among leading alcohol brands in the UK, and to outline the implications for both regulatory policies and further research. Methods: Using screengrab technology, the complete Facebook walls and Twitter timelines for 12 leading UK alcohol brands in November 2011 were captured and archived. A total of 701 brand-authored posts were identified and categorized using a thematic coding frame. Key strategic trends were identified and analysed in the light of contextual research into recent developments in marketing practice within the alcohol industry. Results: A number of dominating trends were identified. These included the use of real-world tie-ins, interactive games, competitions and timespecific suggestions to drink. These methods reflect a strategy of branded conversation-stimulus which is favoured by social media marketing agencies. Conclusion: A number of distinct marketing methods are deployed by alcohol brands when using social media. These may undermine policies which seek to change social norms around drinking, especially the normalization of daily consumption. Social media marketing also raises questions regarding the efficacy of reactive regulatory frameworks. Further research into both the nature and impact of alcohol marketing on social media is needed.© The Author 2012. Medical Council on Alcohol and Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - EVOLUTIONARY GAME MODEL ANALYSIS OF COUNTY-LEVEL INTEGRATED HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS IN CHINA
IS  - 5
VL  - 30
AB  - China is actively encouraging the development of County-level Integrated Health Organizations. This study's goal is to evaluate a balanced approach to patient, government, and county-level hospital involvement in the development of County-level Integrated Health Organizations. To encourage tripartite collaboration, a tripartite evolutionary game model of CIHOs is created, and behavioral tactics and important parameters of the three stakeholders are carefully examined and introduced. Simulation experiments and sensitivity analysis reveal that under government and county-level hospital decisions, patients' choice of graded access is a dominant strategy for themselves. However, the presence of this equilibrium is influenced by the strength of government incentives and the level of county-level hospital participation. It is possible, in certain circumstances, to build CIHOs with the active support of the government, patients who follow graded access, and county-level hospitals who actively participate in the building of CIHOs. However, this requires the interaction of several variables, including the volume of government subsidies, the prestige gain of the government, the benefit of patients who follow graded access, and the cost of labor and financial resources of county-level hospitals. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING.

TI  - Evolution of friendship network and daily activities of high school students
AB  - The goal of the present study is to analyze the evolution of adolescent friendship network and daily activities. The research question is that what kinds of activity and network variables explain the changes over time within a friendship network? At what stages are these variables important? A network survey was carried out in a classroom of a high school. The subjects were 45 high school students of 28 boys and 17 girls. Sociometric data were collected by having each student nominate up to 16 intimate classmates. These nominations were measured their gender and common activities including chatting, participating students' club, going to cram, having dinner, discussing homework, playing game, heart to heart talking, going to movie, shopping, and outdoor sport. Panel data was collected 10 times across 3 semesters from Sep. 2008 to Jan. 2010. The program SIENA was applied to estimate the models for the evolution of social networks and daily activities. Results showed that heart to heart talk had effect on friendship formation in the beginning of the first 2 semesters, going to cram and sporting had effects on keeping friendship between 2 semesters, and going to cram, club, and sporting had effects at the end of observations. It is concluded that each daily activity has specific effect on friendship initiation, maintaining, and continue at different stage for adolescents, and the mechanism is discussed.

TI  - Exercising with Baxter: Preliminary support for assistive social-physical human-robot interaction
IS  - 1
VL  - 17
AB  - Background: The worldwide population of older adults will soon exceed the capacity of assisted living facilities. Accordingly, we aim to understand whether appropriately designed robots could help older adults stay active at home. Methods: Building on related literature as well as guidance from experts in game design, rehabilitation, and physical and occupational therapy, we developed eight human-robot exercise games for the Baxter Research Robot, six of which involve physical human-robot contact. After extensive iteration, these games were tested in an exploratory user study including 20 younger adult and 20 older adult users. Results: Only socially and physically interactive games fell in the highest ranges for pleasantness, enjoyment, engagement, cognitive challenge, and energy level. Our games successfully spanned three different physical, cognitive, and temporal challenge levels. User trust and confidence in Baxter increased significantly between pre- and post-study assessments. Older adults experienced higher exercise, energy, and engagement levels than younger adults, and women rated the robot more highly than men on several survey questions. Conclusions: The results indicate that social-physical exercise with a robot is more pleasant, enjoyable, engaging, cognitively challenging, and energetic than similar interactions that lack physical touch. In addition to this main finding, researchers working in similar areas can build on our design practices, our open-source resources, and the age-group and gender differences that we found. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Experiential avoidance and technological addictions in adolescents
IS  - 2
VL  - 5
AB  - Background and aims: This study focuses on the use of popular information and communication technologies (ICTs) by adolescents: the Internet, mobile phones, and video games. The relationship of ICT use and experiential avoidance (EA), a construct that has emerged as underlying and transdiagnostic to a wide variety of psychological problems, including behavioral addictions, is examined. EA refers to a self-regulatory strategy involving efforts to control or escape from negative stimuli such as thoughts, feelings, or sensations that generate strong distress. This strategy, which may be adaptive in the short term, is problematic if it becomes an inflexible pattern. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore whether EA patterns were associated with addictive or problematic use of ICT in adolescents. Methods: A total of 317 students of the Spanish southeast between 12 and 18 years old were recruited to complete a questionnaire that included questions about general use of each ICTs, an experiential avoidance questionnaire, a brief inventory of the Big Five personality traits, and specific questionnaires on problematic use of the Internet, mobile phones, and video games. Results: Correlation analysis and linear regression showed that EA largely explained results regarding the addictive use of the Internet, mobile phones, and video games, but not in the same way. As regards gender, boys showed a more problematic use of video games than girls. Concerning personality factors, conscientiousness was related to all addictive behaviors. Discussion and conclusions: We conclude that EA is an important construct that should be considered in future models that attempt to explain addictive behaviors. © 2016 The Author(s).

TI  - Exploratory evaluations of a computer game supporting cognitive behavioural therapy for adolescents
AB  - The need to provide effective mental health treatments for adolescents has been described as a global public health challenge [27]. In this paper we discuss the exploratory evaluations of the first adolescent intervention to fully integrate a computer game implementing Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Three distinct studies are presented: a detailed evaluation in which therapists independent of the design team used the game with 6 adolescents experiencing clinical anxiety disorders; a study in which a member of the design team used the game with 15 adolescents; and finally a study assessing the acceptability of the game and intervention with 216 practicing therapists. Findings are presented within the context of a framework for the design and evaluation of complex health interventions. The paper provides an in-depth insight into the use of therapeutic games to support adolescent interventions and provides stronger evidence than previously available for both their effectiveness and acceptability to stakeholders.

TI  - Exploring 3D User Interface Technologies for Improving the Gaming Experience
AB  - We present the results of a comprehensive video game study which explores how the gaming experience is effected when several 3D user interface technologies are used simultaneously. We custom designed an air-combat game integrating several 3DUI technologies (stereoscopic 3D, head tracking, and finger-count gestures) and studied the combined effect of these technologies on the gaming experience. Our game design was based on existing design principles for optimizing the usage of these technologies in isolation. Additionally, to enhance depth perception and minimize visual discomfort, the game dynamically optimizes stereoscopic 3D parameters (convergence and separation) based on the user's look direction. We conducted a within subjects experiment where we examined performance data and self-reported data on users perception of the game. Our results indicate that participants performed significantly better when all the 3DUI technologies (stereoscopic 3D, head-tracking and finger-count gestures) were available simultaneously with head tracking as a dominant factor. We explore the individual contribution of each of these technologies to the overall gaming experience and discuss the reasons behind our findings.

TI  - Exploring and Promoting Diagnostic Transparency and Explainability in Online Symptom Checkers
AB  - Online symptom checkers (OSC) are widely used intelligent systems in health contexts such as primary care, remote healthcare, and epidemic control. OSCs use algorithms such as machine learning to facilitate self-diagnosis and triage based on symptoms input by healthcare consumers. However, intelligent systems’ lack of transparency and comprehensibility could lead to unintended consequences such as misleading users, especially in high-stakes areas such as healthcare. In this paper, we attempt to enhance diagnostic transparency by augmenting OSCs with explanations. We first conducted an interview study (N=25) to specify user needs for explanations from users of existing OSCs. Then, we designed a COVID-19 OSC that was enhanced with three types of explanations. Our lab-controlled user study (N=20) found that explanations can significantly improve user experience in multiple aspects. We discuss how explanations are interwoven into conversation flow and present implications for future OSC designs.

TI  - Exploring efficacy of a serious game (tobbstop) for smoking cessation during pregnancy: Randomized controlled trial
IS  - 1
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: Tobacco use during pregnancy entails a serious risk to the mother and harmful effects on the development of the child. Europe has the highest tobacco smoking prevalence (19.3%) compared with the 6.8% global mean. Between 20% to 30% of pregnant women used tobacco during pregnancy worldwide. These data emphasize the urgent need for community education and implementation of prevention strategies focused on the risks associated with tobacco use during pregnancy. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an intervention that incorporates a serious game (Tobbstop) to help pregnant smokers quit smoking. Methods: A two-arm randomized controlled trial enrolled 42 women who visited 2 primary care centers in Catalonia, Spain, between March 2015 and November 2016. All participants were pregnant smokers, above 18 years old, attending consultation with a midwife during the first trimester of pregnancy, and had expressed their desire to stop smoking. Participants were randomized to the intervention (n=21) or control group (n=21). The intervention group was instructed to install the game on their mobile phone or tablet and use it for 3 months. Until delivery, all the participants were assessed on their stage of smoking cessation during their follow-up midwife consultations. The primary outcome was continuous tobacco abstinence until delivery confirmed by the amount of carbon monoxide at each visit, measured with a carboxymeter. Results: Continuous abstinence until delivery outcome was 57% (12/21) in the intervention group versus 14% (3/21) in the control group (hazard ratio=4.31; 95% CI 1.87-9.97; P=.001). The mean of total days without smoking until delivery was higher in the intervention group (mean 139.75, SD 21.76) compared with the control group (mean 33.28, SD 13.27; P<.001). In addition, a Kapplan-Meier survival analysis showed that intervention group has a higher abstinence rate compared with the control group (log-rank test, χ2 1=13.91; P<.001). Conclusions: Serious game use is associated with an increased likelihood to maintain abstinence during the intervention period if compared with those not using the game. Pregnancy is an ideal opportunity to intervene and control tobacco use among future mothers. On the other hand, serious games are an emerging technology, growing in importance, which are shown to be a good tool to help quitting smoking during pregnancy and also to maintain this abstinent behavior. However, because of the study design limitations, these outcomes should be interpreted with caution. More research, using larger samples and longer follow-up periods, is needed to replicate the findings of this study. © JMIR Serious Games.All right reserved.

TI  - Exploring smartphone addiction: Insights from long-term telemetric behavioral measures
IS  - 2
VL  - 9
AB  - This study examined smartphone user behaviors and their relation to self-reported smartphone addiction. Thirty-four users who did not own smartphones were given instrumented iPhones that logged all phone use over the course of the year-long study. At the conclusion of the study, users were asked to rate their level of addiction to the device. Sixty-two percent agreed or strongly agreed that they were addicted to their iPhones. These users showed differentiated smartphone use as compared to those users who did not indicate an addiction. Addicted users spent twice as much time on their phone and launched applications much more frequently (nearly twice as often) as compared to the non-addicted user. Mail, Messaging, Facebook and the Web drove this use. Surprisingly, Games did not show any difference between addicted and nonaddicted users. Addicted users showed significantly lower time-per-interaction than did non-addicted users for Mail, Facebook and Messaging applications. One addicted user reported that his addiction was problematic, and his use data was beyond three standard deviations from the upper hinge. The implications of the relationship between the logged and self-report data are discussed.

TI  - Exploring the influence of game design on learning and voluntary use in an online vascular anatomy study aid
VL  - 87
AB  - This research explores the educational impact of an online study aid-game for studying human vascular anatomy (n = 24) versus a similar non-game study aid (n = 22) and how it relates to medical students' demographic traits and voluntary use over a 35-day period. Hierarchical linear regression models revealed that study aid success rate (a metric for assessing performance through the study aids) was a significant predictor of anatomy test improvement with the game (β = 0.41, p = 0.05), but not for the non-game (β = 0.14, p = 0.56). Our analyses suggest that game mechanics encouraged more specific problem-solving strategies than did the control study aid, leading to greater predictability of learning outcomes. There was a non-significant trend among game treatment participants, who were more likely to complete study tasks than those assigned to the control treatment (p = 0.11). It would appear that students' studying habits had the greatest influence (though opposite in both tools) on level of engagement in study aid use. However, contrary to expectations, self-reported gaming habits did not impact participation. Overall, these findings support the integration of game design into undergraduate study aids as a means of increasing use of supplementary educational tools and assessing knowledge. © 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Exploring the specific needs of persons with multiple sclerosis for mhealth solutions for physical activity: Mixed-methods study
IS  - 2
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the world’s most common neurologic disorders, with symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive problems, and issues with mobility. Evidence suggests that physical activity (PA) helps people with MS reduce fatigue and improve quality of life. The use of mobile technologies for health has grown in recent years with little involvement from relevant stakeholders. User-centered design (UCD) is a design philosophy with the goal of creating solutions specific to the needs and tasks of the intended users. UCD involves stakeholders early and often in the design process. In a preliminary study, we assessed the landscape of commercially available MS mobile health (mHealth) apps; to our knowledge, no study has explored what persons with MS and their formal care providers think of mHealth solutions for PA. Objective: The aim of this study was to (1) explore MS-specific needs for MS mHealth solutions for PA, (2) detect perceived obstacles and facilitators for mHealth solutions from persons with MS and health care professionals, and (3) understand the motivational aspects behind adoption of mHealth solutions for MS. Methods: A mixed-methods design study was conducted in Kliniken Valens, Switzerland, a clinic specializing in neurological rehabilitation. We explored persons with MS and health care professionals who work with them separately. The study had a qualitative part comprising focus groups and interviews, and a quantitative part with standardized tools such as satisfaction with life scale and electronic health (eHealth) literacy. Results: A total of 12 persons with relapsing-remitting MS and 12 health care professionals from different backgrounds participated in the study. Participants were well-educated with an even distribution between genders. Themes identified during analysis were MS-related barriers and facilitators, mHealth design considerations, and general motivational aspects. The insights generated were used to create MS personas for design purposes. Desired mHealth features were as follows: (1) activity tracking, (2) incentives for completing tasks and objectives, (3) customizable goal setting, (4) optional sociability, and (5) game-like attitude among others. Potential barriers to mHealth apps adoption were as follows: (1) rough on-boarding experiences, (2) lack of clear use benefits, and (3) disruption of the health care provider-patient relationship. Potential facilitators were identified: (1) endorsements from experts, (2) playfulness, and (3) tailored to specific persons with MS needs. A total of 4 MS personas were developed to provide designers and computer scientists means to help in the creation of future mHealth solutions for MS.Conclusions: mHealth solutions for increasing PA in persons with MS hold promise. Allowing for realistic goal setting and positive feedback, while minimizing usability burdens, seems to be critical for the adoption of such apps. Fatigue management is especially important in this population; more attention should be brought to this area. © Guido Giunti, Jan Kool, Octavio Rivera Romero, Enrique Dorronzoro Zubiete.

TI  - Face Work: A Human-Centered Investigation into Facial Verification in Gig Work
IS  - CSCW1
VL  - 7
AB  - Through intensive research on datasets, benchmarks, and models, the computer-vision community has taken great strides to identify the societal biases intrinsic to these technologies. Less is known about the last mile of the computer-vision machine-learning pipeline: on-the-ground integration into the real world. In this paper, I&nbsp;analyze facial verification technology (FVT) through its use as account verification in ride-hail work. Using a sociotechnical framework combined with empirical qualitative research methods, including interviews and analysis of an online community of workers, this research is a deep dive into recognition technologies at the level of local practice.&nbsp;Findings reveal the high-stakes articulation labor demanded of workers to be recognized by these systems, including maintaining multiple mobile devices, repeatedly uploading requisite images, spending time and resources visiting customer-service centers, and making physical changes to their bodies and environments. These strategies constitute repairs to the failures of computer vision in dynamic environments and are required to successfully engage in the sociotechnical interaction protocols demanded by FVT. Drawing on Erving Goffman's terminology around social interaction rituals, I term these cognitive and behavioral negotiations "face work." Drivers' dynamic, responsive, and ad-hoc attempts to become machine-readable have significant implications for relations between identity and power in spaces of security and work, as well as for the integration of machine-learning systems into safety-critical infrastructures. Ultimately, this research emphasizes the crucial role of end users who create and maintain the conditions required for computer vision to produce judgment.

TI  - Facial Features of Non-player Creatures Can Influence Moral Decisions in Video Games
IS  - 1
VL  - 15
AB  - With the development of increasingly sophisticated computer graphics, there is a continuous growth of the variety and originality of virtual characters used in movies and games. So far, however, their design has mostly been led by the artist’s preferences, not by perceptual studies. In this article, we explored how effective non-player character design can be used to influence gameplay. In particular, we focused on abstract virtual characters with few facial features. In experiment 1, we sought to find rules for how to use a character’s facial features to elicit the perception of certain personality traits, using prior findings for human face perception as a basis. In experiment 2, we then tested how perceived personality traits of a non-player character could influence a player’s moral decisions in a video game. We found that the appearance of the character interacting with the subject modulated aggressive behavior towards a non-present individual. Our results provide us with a better understanding of the perception of abstract virtual characters, their employment in video games, as well as giving us some insights about the factors underlying aggressive behavior in video games.

TI  - Feasibility and Efficacy of an mHealth Game for Managing Anxiety: "Flowy" Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial and Design Evaluation
IS  - 1
VL  - 5
AB  - Objective: Meeting the complex needs of patients with chronic common mental health disorders (CMHDs) may be the greatest challenge facing organized medical practice. On the basis of a well-established and proven theoretical foundation for controlled respiration as a behavioral intervention for CMHDs, as well as preliminary evidence that gamification can improve health outcomes through increasing patient engagement, this randomized controlled pilot study evaluated the feasibility and clinical efficacy of a mobile health game called "Flowy" (www.flowygame.com) that digitally delivered breathing retraining exercises for anxiety, panic, and hyperventilation symptom management. Materials and Methods: We designed an unblinded, Web-based, parallel-group randomized controlled trial focusing on feasibility, clinical efficacy, and design proof of concept. In the intervention condition (n = 31), participants received free access to "Flowy" for 4 weeks. In the control condition (n = 32), participants were placed on a waitlist for 4 weeks before being offered free access to "Flowy." Online measurements using psychological self-report questionnaires were made at 2 and 4 weeks post-baseline. Results: At trial conclusion, participants found "Flowy" acceptable as an anxiety management intervention. "Flowy" engaged participants sufficiently to endorse proactive gameplay. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed a reduction in anxiety, panic, and self-report hyperventilation scores in both trial arms, with the intervention arm experiencing greater quality of life. Participants perceived "Flowy" as a fun and useful intervention, proactively used "Flowy" as part of their care, and would recommend "Flowy" to family and friends. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a digital delivery of breathing retraining exercises through a mobile health game can manage anxiety, panic, and hyperventilation symptoms associated with CMHDs.

TI  - Feasibility of an Online and Mobile Videogame Curriculum for Teaching Children Safe and Healthy Cellphone and Internet Behaviors
IS  - 4
VL  - 3
AB  - Objective: Increased prevalence and penetration of cellphone and mobile Internet use have raised significant concerns about children's health and safety by offering new spaces for cyberbullying, harassment, and sexual misconduct. "Cyberhero Mobile Safety" is a videogame-based education program designed using tenets of the capacity model with the goal of instilling the knowledge and skills necessary to safely and productively navigate the mobile online environment. This study evaluates its usability, appeal, and perceived impact and usefulness. Materials and Methods: Six educational videogames were part of a program delivered to 3rd-6th grade students (n=108) across six public schools in Upstate NY. Videogame play was electronically captured to evaluate usability. Likeability, acceptability, and perceived usefulness of videogame content were evaluated through postgame questionnaires. Results: Videogame usability criteria were achieved on 82.7 percent of the students' gameplays. On a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high), mean ratings were 4.09 (standard deviation [SD]=1.28) for likeability, 3.54 (SD=1.61) for acceptability, and 4.16 (SD=1.33) for perceived message usefulness. Conclusions: The "Cyberhero Mobile Safety" program is a feasible and potentially effective platform for delivering information about safe and healthy cellphone and Internet use to children. Results support the use of the capacity model to design educational videogames because games that aligned with theory principles were reported as having the most impact and being the most useful at shifting children's online behaviors. Future research should directly test the individual components of the capacity model to inform educational game design. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.

TI  - Feasibility of implementing intervention methods in an adolescent worksite tobacco control study
IS  - SUPPL. 4
VL  - 12
AB  - Objective: To present feasibility data on SMART, the first teen worksite behavioural tobacco control intervention. Design: This phase II study was designed to estimate the efficacy and feasibility of a small scale, randomised, controlled intervention. Setting and subjects: This study, addressing youths aged 15-18 years, was implemented in four intervention and five control grocery stores that had an average of 44 eligible teens. Interventions: The tobacco use cessation and prevention interventions were based on social influences and peer leader models. Employee break rooms served as centres both for interactive activities including open houses, teen advisory boards, peer leader interviews, games and contests; and non-interactive interventions including bulletin boards and table tents with health messages and home mailings. Main process measures: Project staff collected process data on the extent of implementation of intervention activities, participation rates in activities, and contacts with peer leaders. On the final survey, teens reported on awareness of, participation in, and motivation for participating in project activities. Results: Indicators of feasibility were identified and discussed, including the number of activities implemented, teen participation, management support, cost, and barriers to and facilitators of implementation. During the 12 month intervention, a mean of 24.1 interactive activities and 55.3 non-interactive activities were implemented, and a mean 14.2% participation rate per activity per site was achieved. Eighty four per cent of teens reported being aware of SMART, and 39% reported participating in interactive and 67% in non-interactive activities. Conclusions: Teen smoking cessation rates in worksite programmes might be improved if they are conducted in companies where there is job stability and if teen programmes are part of worksite-wide tobacco control programmes that include both teens and adults.

TI  - Feasibility of Repeated Assessment of Cognitive Function in Older Adults Using a Wireless, Mobile, Dry-EEG Headset and Tablet-Based Games
VL  - 12
AB  - Access to affordable, objective and scalable biomarkers of brain function is needed to transform the healthcare burden of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, both resting and in combination with targeted cognitive tasks, have demonstrated utility in tracking disease state and therapy response in a range of conditions from schizophrenia to Alzheimer's disease. But conventional methods of recording this data involve burdensome clinic visits, and behavioural tasks that are not effective in frequent repeated use. This paper aims to evaluate the technical and human-factors feasibility of gathering large-scale EEG using novel technology in the home environment with healthy adult users. In a large field study, 89 healthy adults aged 40–79 years volunteered to use the system at home for 12 weeks, 5 times/week, for 30 min/session. A 16-channel, dry-sensor, portable wireless headset recorded EEG while users played gamified cognitive and passive tasks through a tablet application, including tests of decision making, executive function and memory. Data was uploaded to cloud servers and remotely monitored via web-based dashboards. Seventy-eight participants completed the study, and high levels of adherence were maintained throughout across all age groups, with mean compliance over the 12-week period of 82% (4.1 sessions per week). Reported ease of use was also high with mean System Usability Scale scores of 78.7. Behavioural response measures (reaction time and accuracy) and EEG components elicited by gamified stimuli (P300, ERN, Pe and changes in power spectral density) were extracted from the data collected in home, across a wide range of ages, including older adult participants. Findings replicated well-known patterns of age-related change and demonstrated the feasibility of using low-burden, large-scale, longitudinal EEG measurement in community-based cohorts. This technology enables clinically relevant data to be recorded outside the lab/clinic, from which metrics underlying cognitive ageing could be extracted, opening the door to potential new ways of developing digital cognitive biomarkers for disorders affecting the brain. © Copyright © 2021 McWilliams, Barbey, Dyer, Islam, McGuinness, Murphy, Nolan, Passmore, Rueda-Delgado and Buick.

TI  - Feasibility Study of Interactive Game Technologies to Improve Experience with Inhaler Spacer Devices in Young Children
IS  - 2
VL  - 2
AB  - Introduction: The correct use of inhaler devices with facemasks and spacers in young children can be difficult for both children and parents, resulting in distress for both, poor adherence and ineffective drug delivery. The aim of this study was to develop and assess the utility and impact of an interactive electronic game designed to improve the experience of spacer devices in young asthmatic children. Methods: The Respiratory Aid For Inhaler (RAFIhaler) technology consists of a smartphone mounted on a metered dose inhaler with a valved holding chamber device (spacer) and connected to an electronic sensor adjacent to the outflow valve of the spacer. A custom-designed android application on the smartphone derives the child’s breathing patterns from the sensor, translating this information into visible effects on on-screen cartoon characters. After a period of iterative development, the final structure and software design was tested on children at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital who had been admitted with acute wheeze. A survey, including open-ended questions, was administered to assess the parent and child’s reaction to the RAFIhaler. Results: A total of 14 children (age range 2–7 years; 7 boys) participated in the study and used the RAFIhaler, of whom 13 completed the final survey; all 14 parents completed the survey. All 13 children reported they enjoyed playing the game. Ten of these children (91%) felt that the RAFIhaler helped them in taking their medication, and 13 of the 14 parents felt that RAFIhaler helped their children use their spacer. The one parent who felt that the RAFIhaler was not of any benefit felt his/her child already used the inhaler well. Some of the benefits of the RAFIhaler specifically voiced by parents were “enjoyable” (n = 3), “good distraction” (n = 3), “made child calmer” (n = 2), “helped in breathing/inhalation technique” (n = 3) and “would be useful in home setting” (n = 1). Conclusion: Young children may benefit from the incorporation of devices and game applications with use of their inhalers. Feedback from children and parents suggests potential benefits to children may include learning correct use, reducing distress and anxiety and improving overall adherence. © 2016, The Author(s).

TI  - Fertility and sexuality issues in congenital lifelong urology patients: male aspects
IS  - 4
VL  - 39
AB  - Purpose: To review existing literature about fertility and sexuality of boys born with complex congenital genitourinary anomalies. Methods: A Pubmed review was performed in December 2018 to identify the most relevant original manuscripts regarding male complex congenital conditions affecting the urogenital system in male patients including spina bifida (SB), bladder exstrophy–epispadias complex (BEEC) and hypospadias. A comprehensive review was drafted exploring sexual dysfunction from a medical, psychosexual, surgical and reproductive point of view during transition from childhood (or adolescence) to adulthood. Results: About 75% of men with SB have erectile dysfunction (ED) (Gamé et al. in Urology 67(3):566–570, 2006; Diamond et al. in 58(4):434–435, 1986). Most SB patients have impaired sexual development mainly due to diminished self-esteem, dependence on caregivers and lack of privacy (Blum et al. in Pediatrics 88(2):280–285, 1991). Men with BEEC have fewer intimate relationships than women because of the greater difficulties with issues regarding their genitalia and sexual activities (Deans et al. in Am J Obstet Gynecol 206(6):496.e1–496.e6, 2012). However, a good quality of life is achievable with the effective use of coping strategies (Deng et al. in Transl Androl Urol 7:941, 2018; Rikken et al. in BMC Womens Health 18(1):163, 2018; Friedler et al. in Reprod Biomed Online 32(1):54–61, 2016). Chordee occurs in 25% of all hypospadias patients. More severe hypospadias is related to a greater risk for complications. The long-term sexual quality of life (QoL) in men who underwent hypospadias surgery is influenced by a lot of factors. Therefore, an interactive and dynamic biopsychosocial model of sexual QoL was proposed. Conclusions: The care of patients with congenital urologic conditions becomes a challenge especially in the period of ‘transition’. The goal of follow-up is a holistic management viewed from a medical, psychosexual, surgical end reproductive point. All patients should be asked for specific urinary, fecal or sexual concerns. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Fighthpv: Design and evaluation of a mobile game to raise awareness about human papillomavirus and nudge people to take action against cervical cancer
IS  - 2
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection globally. High-risk HPV types can cause cervical cancer, other anogenital cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer; low-risk HPV types can cause genital warts. Cervical cancer is highly preventable through HPV vaccination and screening; however, a lack of awareness and knowledge of HPV and these preventive strategies represents an important barrier to reducing the burden of the disease. The rapid development and widespread use of mobile technologies in the last few years present an opportunity to overcome this lack of knowledge and create new, effective, and modern health communication strategies. Objective: This study aimed to describe the development of a mobile app called FightHPV, a game-based learning tool that educates mobile technology users about HPV, the disease risks associated with HPV infection, and existing preventive methods. Methods: The first version of FightHPV was improved in a design-development-evaluation loop, which incorporated feedback from a beta testing study of 40 participants, a first focus group of 6 participants aged between 40 and 50 years and a second focus group of 23 participants aged between 16 and 18 years. Gameplay data from the beta testing study were collected using Google Analytics (Google), whereas feedback from focus groups was evaluated qualitatively. Of the 29 focus group participants, 26 returned self-administered questionnaires. HPV knowledge before and after playing the game was evaluated in the 22 participants from the second focus group who returned a questionnaire. Results: FightHPV communicates concepts about HPV, associated diseases and their prevention by representing relationships among 14 characters in 6 episodes of 10 levels each, with each level being represented by a puzzle. Main concepts were reinforced with text explanations. Beta testing revealed that many players either failed or had to retry several times before succeeding at the more difficult levels in the game. It also revealed that players gave up at around level 47 of 60, which prompted the redesign of FightHPV to increase accessibility to all episodes. Focus group discussions led to several improvements in the user experience and dissemination of health information in the game, such as making all episodes available from the beginning of the game and rewriting the information in a more appealing way. Among the 26 focus group participants who returned a questionnaire, all stated that FightHPV is an appealing educational tool, 69% (18/26) reported that they liked the game, and 81% (21/26) stated that the game was challenging. We observed an increase in HPV knowledge after playing the game (P=.001). Conclusions: FightHPV was easy to access, use, and it increased awareness about HPV infection, its consequences, and preventive measures. FightHPV can be used to educate people to take action against HPV and cervical cancer. © 2019 JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fighting strategies in crayfish Orconectes rusticus (Decapoda, Cambaridae) differ with hunger state and the presence of food cues
IS  - 8
VL  - 107
AB  - Crayfish, bearing dangerous weapons in the form of chelae, resolve intraspecific conflicts using stereotyped behaviors and structured, escalated encounters. According to predictions of game theory models, any decision to resort to unrestrained combat without prior careful behavioral assessment of the opponent's fighting abilities carries great risks. The present study examines the significance of internal hunger states and the presence of chemical food cues in this decision process using a 2 × 2 factorial design. Hungry crayfish escalated more rapidly, and thus took greater risks, during agonistic encounters, while the presence of a food source reduced the rate at which fights increased in intensity. However, there were no significant differences in fighting behavior as a result of the interaction between these two variables. We then address the complex trade-offs that individuals face in fighting with respect to increased risks of injury, appetitive states, and opportunities for resource access.

TI  - First record of <i>Trichinella</i> in <i>Leopardus</i> <i>guigna</i>
(Carnivora, Felidae) and <i>Galictis</i> <i>cuja</i> (Carnivora,
Mustelidae): new hosts in Chile
VL  - 9
AB  - Background. Trichinellosis is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide
distribution. It is caused by several species of nematodes in the genus
Trichinella. Trichinella spp. are transmitted through predation or
carrion consumption and occur in domestic and sylvatic cycles. In humans
trichinellosis occurs due to the consumption of raw or undercooked,
infected meat and is mainly associated with the household slaughter of
pigs or the consumption of game animals without veterinary inspection, a
cultural practice that is difficult to resolve. Therefore, knowledge of
this parasite's reservoir is relevant for better implementing public
health strategies. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of
Trichinella sp. in several carnivore and omnivore vertebrates in
central-southern Chile.
Methods. We collected muscle tissue from a total of 53 animals from 15
species and were digested to detect Trichinella larvae which were
further identified to species level using molecular techniques.
Results. We detected Trichinella larvae in Leopardus guigna (Felidae)
and Galictis cuja (Mustelidae). We identified the larvae collected from
L. guigna as Trichinella spiralis, but we were unable to molecularly
characterize the larvae from G. cuja. This is the first record of
Trichinella in a native mustelid of South America and the first record
of T. spiralis in L. guigna. This study identified two novel hosts;
however, further work is needed to identify the role that these and
other hosts play in the cycle of Trichinella in Chile.

TI  - First Report of <i>Echinococcus ortleppi</i> in Free-Living Wild Boar
(<i>Sus scrofa</i>) from Portugal
IS  - 6
VL  - 9
AB  - Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonosis that is prevalent worldwide. It
is considered endemic in Portugal but few studies have been performed on
Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato and their hosts. In this study, CE
cysts are reported for the first time in a free-living wild boar (Sus
scrofa) in Portugal. The presence of the metacestodes in the liver of
the wild boar was identified by morphological features, microscopic
examination and molecular analysis. The sequencing of part of the DNA
nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS-1) region revealed
a G5 genotype that presently corresponds to Echinococcus ortleppi. This
is the first report of E. ortleppi in Portugal and to the best of the
authors' knowledge, in Europe. These results suggest that wild boar may
be a host of CE, namely, crossing the livestock-wildlife interface,
which has important public health implications. Wildlife reservoirs must
be taken into account as CE hosts and surveillance of game as well as
health education for hunters should be implemented using a One Health
approach, with implementation of feasible and tailor-made control
strategies, namely, proper elimination of byproducts in the field.

TI  - Food safety and young consumers: Testing a serious game as a risk communication tool
VL  - 62
AB  - Raising consumers' awareness about food safety issues is one of the primary objectives of Italian public health organizations. New dynamic and interactive tools, based on web applications, are already playing a leading role in health promotion campaigns targeted at adolescents. Among the web-based tools specifically designed for young people, educational videogames have proved especially effective in furthering learning and disseminating information, as they arouse adolescents' interest and curiosity. When a number of cases of Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) were reported in 2010, particularly among children, the Italian Ministry of Health stressed the need to implement communication initiatives aimed at raising consumers' awareness of the potential risks associated with raw milk consumption at home. The pilot study described in the article is a relevant example of educational projects implemented in Italy, oriented to transmit knowledge about food risks to young consumers (aged 16-18). To provide correct information on safe milk handling practices and to reduce health issues, including serious ones, the videogame "A mysterious poisoning" was developed. This tool was administered online to 359 upper secondary school students from four different provinces in Italy. The videogame covered all stages of the milk supply chain, from stable to table, and enabled players to identify the crucial moments when milk can be contaminated and to discover safe milk handling practices. By completing a series of tasks, students helped a detective discover the cause of a food poisoning outbreak. This videogame provided an opportunity for students to test their knowledge of the product and to receive more detailed and accurate information. Data collected through two structured questionnaires that were administered before and after the controlled use of the videogame showed that this serious game was capable of changing players' perception of risk exposure and their cognitive associations, particularly increasing their levels of knowledge about the risks associated with raw milk consumption. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Fostering Engagement in Health Behavior Change: Iterative Development of an Interactive Narrative Environment to Enhance Adolescent Preventive Health Services
IS  - 2
VL  - 67
AB  - Purpose: Accidents and unintentional injuries account for the greatest number of adolescent deaths, often involving use of alcohol and other substances. This article describes the iterative design and development of Interactive Narrative System for Patient-Individualized Reflective Exploration (INSPIRE), a narrative-centered behavior change environment for adolescents focused on reducing alcohol use. INSPIRE is designed to serve as an extension to clinical preventive care, engaging adolescents in a theoretically grounded intervention for health behavior change by leveraging 3D game engine and interactive narrative technologies. Methods: Adolescents were engaged in all aspects of the iterative, multiyear development process of INSPIRE through over 20 focus groups and iterative pilot testing involving more than 145 adolescents. Qualitative findings from focus groups are reported, as well as quantitative findings from small-scale pilot sessions investigating adolescent engagement with a prototype version of INSPIRE using a combination of questionnaire and interaction trace log data. Results: Adolescents reported that they found INSPIRE to be engaging, believable, and relevant to their lives. The majority of participants indicated that the narrative's protagonist character was like them (84%) and that the narrative featured virtual characters that they could relate to (79%). In the interactive narrative, the goals most frequently chosen by adolescents were “stay in control” (60%) and “do not get in trouble” (55%). Conclusions: With a strong theoretical framework (social-cognitive behavior change theory) and technology advances (narrative-centered learning environments), the field is well positioned to design health behavior change systems that can realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

TI  - Frequency of and Factors Associated with the Presence of a History of Probable Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in a Population of Patients with Sex Addiction
IS  - 3
VL  - 29
AB  - Introduction: Since the first description of sex addiction (SA) by Carnes, research on this problematic behaviour has continued to grow, and the association with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) appears to be frequent. This study aimed to estimate the frequency of a history of probable ADHD in a population of patients with SA and to explore the factors associated with it. Methods: One hundred 85 patients referred to the Nantes University Hospital for SA between 2011 and 2020 were included. Patients completed the Sexual Addiction Screening Test (SAST) or its revised version (SAST-R) to establish the presence of SA. As the SAST-R was not validated in French, we conducted a validation study for the French version. ADHD was screened using the Wender-Utah Rating Scale in childhood and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale in adulthood. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the presence of a history of probable ADHD. Results: Childhood ADHD was identified in 36% of patients with SA. Factors associated with the presence of a history of probable ADHD were a low education level, an earlier age of onset of problematic sexual behaviour, another addictive disorder, an anxiety disorder, impulsivity (high negative urgency score), and high scores on harm avoidance and novelty-seeking temperament scales. Furthermore, the French version of the SAST-R displayed good psychometric properties, especially excellent sensitivity. Conclusion: The frequency of a history of probable ADHD among patients with SA is consistent with the literature and close to the highest range. Specific personality traits in patients with both SA and a history of probable ADHD could induce lasting problems of adaptation, which may precipitate the development of SA or maintain it.  © 2023 S.

TI  - Friendship characteristics and activity patterns of adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder
IS  - 4
VL  - 17
AB  - This study compared perceptions of adolescents' friendships between adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their parents, examined factors associated with friendship qualities, and investigated the adolescents' reports on the activities they did with friends and how activity patterns differed by gender. Ninety-one adolescents with an ASD and their parents completed mail-based surveys during the summer months. Adolescents with an ASD identified more friends than did their parents, but they agreed on the friends' characteristics. About half of the adolescents spent an average of 4 hours per day with friends during the summer months. Male adolescents with an ASD most frequently played video games with friends, whereas females most frequently had conversations with friends. The findings suggest that adolescents with an ASD and their parents identify different peers as the adolescent's friends. The findings also reveal similarities and differences in friendships between adolescents with an ASD and typically developing adolescents. © The Author(s) 2011.

TI  - Friends or Foes? Socioemotional Support and Gaze Behaviors in Mixed Groups of Humans and Robots
AB  - This study investigated non-verbal behavior and socioemotional interactions in small-groups of humans and robots. Sixty-participants were involved in a group setting in which they were required to play a card game with another human and two robots (playing as partners or as opponents). The two robots displayed different goal orientations: a competitive robot (named Emys-) and a relationship-driven cooperative robot (named Glin+). Video recordings of the interactions were analyzed in three game play sessions. Eye gaze and socioemotional support behaviors were coded based on Bales» Interaction Process Analysis. Results indicated that gaze behavior towards partners was more frequently displayed to the relationship-driven robot than to the competitive robot and the human partners. In contrast, gaze towards opponents occurred more often towards the competitive robot than to the relationship-driven robot and the human opponents. Socioemotional support occurred more frequently towards partners than opponents, and was also displayed more often towards humans than towards robots. Moreover, in the sessions where the robots were opponents, participants provided more support to the competitive robot. This investigation in small groups of humans and robots provided evidence of different interaction patterns towards robots displaying distinct orientation goals, which can be useful in guiding the successful design of social robots.

TI  - From 1 year to the next: Video gaming life-style predicts subsequent
psychosocial risk in adolescent boys and girls
IS  - 9
VL  - 58
AB  - Aim The ubiquitous societal presence of screens and gaming software is
ever growing in popularity. However, can this recreational life-style
pose risks for children's psychosocial adjustment? We thus examine
associations between gaming life-style and later psychosocial
development. Methods The study sample originates from the 2120 boys and
girls from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development birth
cohort. At age 12, 625 boys and 702 girls from the original sample
self-reported the number of hours engaged in video gaming per week and 1
year later, they self-reported psychosocial outcomes. Results Among
boys, higher weekly video gaming frequency at age 12 forecasted
increases in subsequent reactive aggression, emotional distress and ADHD
symptoms at age 13. For girls, higher weekly video gaming frequency at
age 12 predicted increases in subsequent reactive aggression and ADHD
symptoms at age 13. No association between video game use and emotional
distress was found for girls. Conclusion In both boys and girls, a more
intense video gaming life-style predicted subsequent risks for reactive
aggression and ADHD symptoms, compared with their same sex counterparts
reporting less intensity. For boys only, video gaming was associated
with subsequent reactive emotional distress, likely due to the gender
differences in violent content. Our data were collected at a time when
there were less versatile screen-based technologies; therefore, our
findings can be interpreted as very conservative compared to current
estimates. Paediatric professionals and allied disciplines must take
preventive measures to ensure that parents are aware of the risks
associated with excessive use by their sons and daughters.

TI  - From P0 to P6 medicine, a model of highly participatory, narrative, interactive, and "augmented" medicine: Some considerations on Salvatore Iaconesi's clinical story
VL  - 7
AB  - Salvatore Iaconesi was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor. He decided to share his clinical records not only with doctors but with everybody who wishes to find him a cure. "Because cure is not unique," he emphasizes "there are cures for the body and cures for the soul, and everyone, from a painter to a musician, can find me a cure. Please, feel free to take my clinical history for example and let it become a game, a video, a music, a picture, whatever you like." The emblematic hallmark of the changing times, Salvatore Iaconesi's case is an example of how many profound revolutions and steps medicine has undertaken during the past few centuries. Stemming from a form of remote medical paternalism and arriving at the concept of a therapeutic alliance, medicine nowadays faces challenges and opportunities at a level before unforeseeable and unimaginable. The new concept of P6 medicine (personalized, predictive, preventive, participatory, psychocognitive, and public) is discussed, together with its profound implications. © 2013 Bragazzi, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

TI  - From Virtual Strangers to IRL Friends: Relationship Development in Livestreaming Communities on Twitch
IS  - CSCW2
VL  - 4
AB  - Accounts of the social experience within livestreaming channels vary widely, from the frenetic "crowdroar" offered in some channels to the close-knit, "participatory communities" within others. What kinds of livestreaming communities enable the types of meaningful conversation and connection that support relationship development, and how? In this paper, we explore how personal relationships develop within Twitch, a popular livestreaming service. Interviews with 21 pairs who met initially within Twitch channels illustrate how interactions originating in Twitch's text-based, pseudonymous chat environment can evolve into close relationships, marked by substantial trust and support. Consistent with Walther's hyperpersonal model, these environments facilitate self-disclosure and conversation by reducing physical cues and emphasizing common ground, while frequent, low-stakes interaction allow relationships to deepen over time. Our findings also highlight boundaries of the hyperpersonal model. As group size increases, participants leverage affordances for elevated visibility to spark interactions; as relationships deepen, they incorporate complementary media channels to increase intimacy. Often, relationships become so deep through purely computer-mediated channels that face-to-face meetings become yet another step in a continuum of relationship development. Findings from a survey of 1,367 members of Twitch communities demonstrate how the suitability of these spaces as venues for relational interaction decreases as communities increase in size. Together, these findings illustrate vividly how hyperpersonal interaction functions in the context of real online communities. We consider implications for the design and management of online communities, including their potential for supporting "strong bridges," relationships which combine the benefits of strong ties and network bridges.

TI  - Frustration and Violence in Mobile Video Games: An Experimental Evaluation of Their Effect on Implicit Aggression
IS  - 2
VL  - 79
AB  - This study tests two competing hypotheses, one based on the general aggression model (GAM), the other on the self-determination theory (SDT). GAM suggests that the crucial factor in video games leading to increased aggressiveness is their violent content; SDT contends that gaming is associated with aggression because of the frustration of basic psychological needs. We used a 2×2 between-subject experimental design with a sample of 128 undergraduates. We assigned each participant randomly to one experimental condition defined by a particular video game, using four mobile video games differing in the degree of violence and in the level of their frustration-invoking gameplay. Aggressiveness was measured using the implicit association test (IAT), administered before and after the playing of a video game. We found no evidence of an association between implicit aggressiveness and violent content or frustrating gameplay. © 2020 Hogrefe Verlag GmbH & Co. KG. All rights reserved.

TI  - Gallery Game: Smartphone-based assessment of long-term memory in adults at risk of Alzheimer’s disease
IS  - 4
VL  - 42
AB  - Introduction: Gallery Game, deployed within the Mezurio smartphone app, targets the processes of episodic memory hypothesized to be first vulnerable to neurofibrillary tau-related degeneration in Alzheimer’s Disease, prioritizing both perirhinal and entorhinal cortex/hippocampal demands. Methods: Thirty-five healthy adults (aged 40–59 years), biased toward those at elevated familial risk of dementia, completed daily Gallery Game tasks for a month. Assessments consisted of cross-modal paired-associate learning, with subsequent tests of recognition and free recall following delays ranging from one to 13 days. Results: Retention intervals of at least three days were needed to evidence significant forgetting at both recognition and paired-associate recall test. The association between Gallery Game outcomes and established in-clinic memory assessments were small but numerically in the anticipated direction. In addition, there was preliminary support for utilizing the perirhinal-dependent pattern of semantic false alarms during object recognition as a marker of early impairment. Conclusions: These results support the need for tests of longer-term memory to sensitively record behavioral differences in adults with no diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Aggregate behavioral outcomes promote Gallery Game’s utility as a digital assessment of episodic memory, aligning with established theoretical models of object memory and showing small yet uniform associations with existing in-clinic tests. Initial support for the discriminatory value of perirhinal-targeted outcomes justifies ongoing large-sample validation against traditional biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - GAME-BASED STUDENT RESPONSE SYSTEM: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF KAHOOT! ON
JUNIOR AND SENIOR INFORMATION SCIENCE STUDENTS' LEARNING
VL  - 19
AB  - Aim/Purpose We aimed to investigate the circumstances under which
Kahoot! (a Game-based Student Response System (GSRS)) increases junior
and senior Information Science university students' learning and
knowledge retention beyond that of traditional teaching methods. We also
explored whether the positive learning impacts of Kahoot! vary as a
function of student subject-knowledge (i.e., junior vs senior students).
Background The effectiveness of game-based student response systems
(GSRSs) as learning tools in the classroom remains unclear, given
inconsistent findings across educational research. Kahoot! enhances
secondary and tertiary students' attention and motivation during class,
but its effectiveness on learning and retention of course knowledge may
vary depending on situational and individual factors. In New Zealand
universities, students spend three years studying towards a Bachelor's
degree, majoring in subject(s) of their choice. By the end of their
third year of study, students are eligible to graduate with a sound
knowledge of their chosen major. Thus, first-year students (referred to
as ``junior students{''}) and third-year students ({''}senior
students{''}) may differ in terms of their learning styles and their
ability and willingness to integrate Kahoot! use into their course work
and revision. It is hypothesised that differences in subject knowledge
between junior versus senior students will influence the perceived
effectiveness of Kahoot!.
Methodology Thirteen first-year (junior) and fourteen third-year
(senior) Information Science students (total n = 27), who used Kahoot!
in seven lectures (for 30 minutes per lecture) were interviewed about
their perception of Kahoot!'s effectiveness. We conducted a
mixed-methods case study of students' interview transcripts, demographic
records and student scores, where thematic (content) analysis was used
to analyse interview responses. Then, we quantified themes for a one-way
ANCOVA, with student subject knowledge predicting Kahoot!'s
effectiveness, when controlling for students' duration of tertiary study
and study habits (i.e., hours dedicated to course work per week) as
potential confounders.
Contribution This study addresses the conflict in existing literature
around whether GSRSs improve student learning beyond traditional
teaching methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows
GSRSs (namely Kahoot!) use improves, or at least, supplements tertiary
students' learning and knowledge retention of lecture content. This
study also reveals how student characteristics (i.e., accumulated
tertiary experience) and their subject knowledge influence the
effectiveness of Kahoot! as a learning tool.
Findings Kahoot!'s use increased students' learning and knowledge
retention, among other positive impacts (e.g., attention and
engagement). However, the perceived learning impact of Kahoot! was
greater for senior students. Senior students found Kahoot! more useful
for learning new knowledge and revising previously acquired knowledge.
On the other hand, while junior students also experienced positive
learning impacts using Kahoot!, they reported concerns regarding limited
and shallow content coverage, and the time-consuming and distracting
nature of the platform.
Recommendations for Practitioners Educators should take care to ensure
GSRSs are appropriately implemented to support rather than replace
traditional teaching methods (e.g., ``chalk and talk{''} style
presentations, PowerPoint use). In addition, lecturers using GSRSs
should clearly inform students about the examinable content and their
expectations for performance in formal assessments.
Recommendations for Researchers The positive impact of Kahoot! use on
students' learning and knowledge retention may be due to stronger
interactions and engagement during class. Researchers should more
closely explore how student-lecturer interactions and in-depth
discussions following GSRS use influence learning. Thus, there is a need
to reevaluate Malone's (1980) intrinsic motivation theory in relation to
the ``interactive{''} or ``enjoyability{''} components experienced
during Kahoot! use.
Impact on Society The positive impacts of Kahoot! use on student
learning vary for junior and senior students. However, our findings
indicate that both cohorts of students benefit from 15-minute Kahoot!
sessions at the end of a lecture or course unit, allowing them to test
their knowledge and revise{*} previously taught material. Kahoot!
provides a comfortable platform that allows students to ask and answer
questions without embarrassment. More experienced students can also
evaluate their learning by creating their own Kahoot! quizzes and
providing feedback to the lecturers. Overall, Kahoot! use could have a
positive impact on teaching and learning globally.
Future Research Beyond the recommendation for researchers above, future
research should explore how differences in lecturers' teaching styles
and students' self-regulation of learning impact Kahoot!'s effectiveness
as a learning tool.

TI  - Game-like interactive environment using BIM-based virtual reality for the timber frame self-build housing sector
VL  - 142
AB  - BIM, gamification, and Virtual Reality applications are more often used to serve the interests of Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA). This paper presents a comprehensive study to exploit these technologies' innovative approaches and capabilities. The study is specifically adopted to implement small and medium-size architectural and construction practices with a limited budget and time dedicated to visualisation creation. The collected evidence proved that a game-like platform combined with BIM could provide simplified data delivery to a client, leading to customer satisfaction, confidence and increased sales. The designed workflow and templates were tested in the case study of a small self-build construction company. The staff was trained to provide BIM data correctly and use supplied game templates. The case study demonstrated that automation of the VR House Configurator creation is achievable. The study's outcome is an integrated solution to regenerate BIM models in the game environment and utilise the house configurator's organised furniture library and costing interface. Furthermore, the usability tests confirmed the applicability, practicability, and validity of the developed framework and tools to deal with the revealed challenges in the self-build sector. Finally, the research provided a fresh approach for the companies in the sector, a step-by-step guide for implementing the innovative changes, and detailed descriptions of the methodologies and workflows. © 2022

TI  - Game on for gender equality: an evaluation of ultimate team in primary physical education
IS  - 9
VL  - 23
AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a pedagogical model that utilized the game of Ultimate Team to promote gender equality among primary school students. This study's goals aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3, 4, 5, and 10, aiming to enhance the students' understanding of equality and the necessity of sustainable development. Previous research has indicated the presence of persistent gender stereotypes and sexist notions in education, thereby necessitating new methods of teaching to foster an environment of inclusivity and equality. Methodology: A quantitative, comparative study design was employed, with 50 primary school students comprising the study sample. The students were divided into an experimental group, which received the intervention, and a control group, which did not. The intervention was a didactic proposal based on the game of Ultimate Team, conducted over seven sessions. The evaluation tool was a self-developed questionnaire, which gauged students' attitudes and perceptions toward gender equality before and after the intervention. This questionnaire consisted of items that were directly related to gender stereotypes and equality. Results: The data analysis showed no significant changes in the overall egalitarian attitudes of students between the pre-and post-intervention stages. Both the experimental and control groups exhibited similar attitudes toward gender equality. However, there were some notable changes observed in certain items (2, 4, and 9). Discussion: Although the intervention did not significantly change the students' overall attitudes towards gender equality, the study yielded interesting insights. The intervention brought to the forefront some persistent stereotypes and sexist notions in the students' responses. Additionally, it was observed that the students struggled to connect their experiences in the game with the broader concept of gender equality. This observation could potentially be attributed to a variety of factors, such as maturity levels, socio-familial influences, or the short duration of the intervention. The need for a more extended and in-depth intervention is highlighted by these results. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the necessity of more extensive and interdisciplinary interventions to instill a deeper understanding of gender equality among students. It suggests that games like Ultimate Team could be leveraged as powerful tools to foster an egalitarian society, particularly within the context of Physical Education. Future research might consider these factors to ensure the efficacy of gender equality interventions. There is a need for longitudinal studies that can monitor the long-term effects of such interventions on students' attitudes and behaviors. © JPES.

TI  - Game On, Hate Off: A Study of Toxicity in Online Multiplayer Environments
AB  - The advent of online spaces, particularly social media platforms and video games, has brought forth a significant challenge: the detection and mitigation of toxic and harmful speech. This issue is not only pervasive but also detrimental to the overall user experience. In this study, we leverage small language models to reliably detect toxicity, achieving an average precision of 0.95. Analyzing eight months of chat data from two Ubisoft games, we uncover patterns and trends in toxic behavior. The insights derived from our research will contribute to the development of healthier online communities and inform preventive measures against toxicity.

TI  - Game Plan—a Brief Web-Based Intervention to Improve Uptake and Use of HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and Reduce Alcohol Use Among Gay and Bisexual Men: Content Analysis
IS  - 1
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has considerable potential for reducing incidence among high-risk groups, such as gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM). However, PrEP’s effectiveness is closely linked with consistent use, and a variety of individual-level barriers, including alcohol use, could impede optimal uptake and use. Web-based interventions can encourage medication adherence, HIV prevention behaviors, and responsible drinking and may help support PrEP care, particularly in resource-limited settings. Objective: We previously developed a web application called Game Plan that was designed to encourage heavy drinking GBM to use HIV prevention methods and reduce their alcohol use and was inspired by brief motivational interventions. This paper aims to describe the web-based content we designed for integration into Game Plan to help encourage PrEP uptake and consistent use among GBM. In this paper, we also aim to describe this content and its rationale. Methods: Similar to the original site, these components were developed iteratively, guided by a thorough user-centered design process involving consultation with subject-matter experts, usability interviews and surveys, and user experience surveys. Results: In addition to Game Plan’s pre-existing content, the additional PrEP components provide specific, personal, and digestible feedback to users about their level of risk for HIV without PrEP and illustrate how much consistent PrEP use could reduce it; personal feedback about their risk for common sexually transmitted infections to address low-risk perceptions; content challenging common beliefs and misconceptions about PrEP to reduce stigma; content confronting familiar PrEP and alcohol beliefs; and a change planning module that allows users to select specific goals for starting and strategies for consistent PrEP use. Users can opt into a weekly 2-way SMS text messaging program that provides similar feedback over a 12-week period after using Game Plan and follows up on the goals they set. Conclusions: Research preliminarily testing the efficacy of these components in improving PrEP outcomes, including uptake, adherence, sexually transmitted infection rates, and alcohol use, is currently ongoing. If supported, these components could provide a scalable tool that can be used in resource-limited settings in which face-to-face intervention is difficult. © Tyler B Wray, Philip A Chan, John P Guigayoma, Christopher W Kahler.

TI  - Game plan, a web-based intervention to improve adherence and persistence to hiv pre-exposure prophylaxis and reduce heavy drinking in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men: Usability and user experience testing
IS  - 11
VL  - 5
AB  - Background: Encouraging consistent use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is essential for reducing HIV incidence, particularly among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), and especially those who engage in heavy drinking. Although practice guidelines recommend providing adherence counseling to PrEP patients, clinics and providers may not have the resources or expertise to provide it. Internet-facilitated interventions have been shown to improve HIV prevention outcomes, including medication and care adherence. Game Plan is a website we created to help users make a tangible plan for reducing their HIV risk. We designed additional components of Game Plan to address key individual level barriers to PrEP use. Objective: The aim of this mixed methods research is to test the usability and user experience of these components with intended users: GBM who drink heavily and are on PrEP. Methods: In study 1 (usability), we completed a detailed individual interview in which participants (n=10) walked through a prototype of the website, thinking aloud as they did, and completed a follow-up interview and web-based survey afterward. Study 2 (user experience) involved providing participants (n=40) with a link to the prototype website to explore on their own and asking them to complete the same follow-up survey afterward. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze quantitative data. Results: Users in both studies gave the website excellent ratings for usability, overall satisfaction, and quality, and most often described the site as informative, helpful, and supportive. Users also rated the site's content and feel as respectful of them and their autonomy, empathetic, and they stated that it conveyed confidence in their ability to change. The study 1 interviews highlighted the importance of the website's esthetics to the participants' engagement with it and its credibility in prompting genuine reflection. Conclusions: GBM who reported heavy drinking and used PrEP generally found a website focused on helping them to create a plan to use PrEP consistently to be helpful. Adopting user-centered design methods and attending to the esthetics of mobile health interventions are important steps toward encouraging engagement and reducing at-risk behaviors. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc..

TI  - Game plan: Development of a web app designed to help men who have sex with men reduce their HIV risk and alcohol use
IS  - 2
VL  - 2
AB  - Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for HIV, and alcohol use is a major risk factor for HIV infection. Internet-facilitated brief interventions have been shown to reduce alcohol use and HIV-risk behavior in other at-risk populations, but have so far incorporated limited content and have not been tested among MSM. Objective: This manuscript describes Game Plan, an interactive, tablet-optimized web application designed to help heavy drinking, high-risk MSM consider reducing their alcohol use and sexual risk behavior. In this paper, we discuss the rationale, goals, and flow for each of Game Plan's components, which were modelled after common in-person and web-based brief motivational interventions for these behaviors. Methods: The development of Game Plan was informed by a thorough user-focused design research process that included (1) audits of existing interventions, (2) focus groups with stakeholders and (3) intended users (high-risk, heavy drinking MSM), and (4) usability testing. The aesthetic, features, and content of the app were designed iteratively throughout this process Results: The fully-functional Game Plan app provides (1) specific and personal feedback to users about their level of risk, (2) exercises to help prompt users to reflect on whether their current behavior aligns with other important life goals and values, and for those open to change, (3) exercises to help users understand factors that contribute to risk, and (4) a change planning module. In general, this flow was constructed to roughly align with the two phases described in early accounts of motivational interviewing (MI): (1) Content intended to elicit intrinsic motivation for change, and when/if sufficient motivation is present, (2) content intended to translate that motivation into specific goals and plans for change. This sequence first focuses on the user's HIV risk behavior, followed by their alcohol use and the connection between the two. The app's overall aesthetic (eg, branding, color palettes, icons/graphics) and its onboarding sequence was also designed to align with the "spirit" of MI by conveying respect for autonomy, open-mindedness (ie, avoiding judgment), and empathy. Conclusions: Should future research support its efficacy in facilitating behavior change, Game Plan could represent a wide-reaching and scalable tool that is well-suited for use in settings where delivering evidence-based, in-person interventions would be difficult or cost-prohibitive. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

TI  - Game playbooks: Tools to guide multidisciplinary teams in developing videogame-based behavior change interventions
IS  - 1
VL  - 4
AB  - As mobile technologies and videogaming platforms are becoming increasingly prevalent in the realm of health and healthcare, so are the opportunities to use these resources to conduct behavioral interventions. The creation and empirical testing of game style interventions, however, is challenged by the requisite collaboration of multidisciplinary teams, including researchers and game developers who have different cultures, terminologies, and standards of evidence. Thus, traditional intervention development tools such as logic models and intervention manuals may need to be augmented by creating what we have termed "Game Playbooks" which are intervention guidebooks that are created by, understood by, and acceptable to all members of the multidisciplinary game development team. The purpose of this paper is to describe the importance and content of a Game Playbook created to aide in the development of a videogame intervention designed specifically for health behavior change in young teens as well as the process for creating such a tool. We draw on the experience of our research and game design team to describe the critical components of the Game Playbook and the necessity of creating such a tool. © 2013 Society of Behavioral Medicine.

VL  - 30
AB  - Objective: to describe the meaning attributed to the use of a game as an educational technology for the involvement of companions in pediatric patient safety. Method: a qualitative study carried out with 16 companions of children admitted to the Pediatric Unit of the public hospital in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Data collection took place from October to December 2019, through semi-structured interviews, after using the game as an educational technology. Symbolic Interactionism was used as the theoretical framework and Inductive Content Analysis, as the method. Results: playing the game in search of patient safety was an important strategy for sharing knowledge and co-responsibility for the companions to engage in the pediatric patient safety actions, in addition to a relevant contribution to the prevention of adverse events. On the other hand, the professionals’ overload and communication problems stood out as barriers to the establishment of a bond among the health team members and, consequently, the involvement of the companions in patient safety. Conclusion: the companions recognized themselves as partners in the prevention of adverse events and highlighted some behavioral changes in favor of patient safety after participating in the playful intervention. Thus, it is considered that the game can be an important and interactive strategy for disseminating information to companions and family members and, consequently, favoring the increased participation of these actors in patient safety actions. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

TI  - Games for Fairness and Interpretability
AB  - As Machine Learning (ML) systems becomes more ubiquitous, ensuring the fair and equitable application of their underlying algorithms is of paramount importance. We argue that one way to achieve this is to proactively cultivate public pressure for ML developers to design and develop fairer algorithms — and that one way to cultivate public pressure while simultaneously serving the interests and objectives of algorithm developers is through gameplay. We propose a new class of games — “games for fairness and interpretability” — as one example of an incentive-aligned approach for producing fairer and more equitable algorithms. Games for fairness and interpretability are carefully-designed games with mass appeal. They are inherently engaging, provide insights into how machine learning models work, and ultimately produce data that helps researchers and developers improve their algorithms. We highlight several possible examples of games, their implications for fairness and interpretability, how their proliferation could creative positive public pressure by narrowing the gap between algorithm developers and the general public, and why the machine learning community could benefit from them.

TI  - Games for Health for Children - Current Status and Needed Research
IS  - 1
VL  - 5
AB  - Videogames for health (G4H) offer exciting, innovative, potentially highly effective methods for increasing knowledge, delivering persuasive messages, changing behaviors, and influencing health outcomes. Although early outcome results are promising, additional research is needed to determine the game design and behavior change procedures that best promote G4H effectiveness and to identify and minimize possible adverse effects. Guidelines for ideal use of different types of G4H by children and adolescents should be elucidated to enhance effectiveness and minimize adverse effects. G4H stakeholders include organizational implementers, policy makers, players and their families, researchers, designers, retailers, and publishers. All stakeholders should be involved in G4H development and have a voice in setting goals to capitalize on their insights to enhance effectiveness and use of the game. In the future, multiple targeted G4H should be available to meet a population's diverse health needs in developmentally appropriate ways. Substantial, consistent, and sophisticated research with appropriate levels of funding is needed to realize the benefits of G4H. Copyright © 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

TI  - Gamification and neurotraining to engage men in behavioral weight loss: Protocol for a factorial randomized controlled trial
VL  - 124
AB  - Over 70% of men are overweight, and most desire weight loss; however, men are profoundly underrepresented in weight loss programs. Gamification represents a novel approach to engaging men and may enhance efficacy through two means: (1) game-based elements (e.g., streaks, badges, team-based competition) to motivate weight control behaviors and (2) arcade-style “neurotraining” to enhance neurocognitive capacities to resist the temptation of unhealthy foods and more automatically select healthy foods. This study will use a 2 × 2 factorial design to examine the independent and combinatory efficacy of gamification and inhibitory control training (ICT). Men with overweight/obesity (N = 228) will receive a 12-month mobile weight loss program that incorporates behavioral weight loss strategies (e.g., self-monitoring, goal setting, stimulus control). Men will be randomly assigned to a non-gamified or gamified version, and an active or sham ICT. A game design company will create the program, with input from a male advisory panel. Aims of the project are to test whether a gamified (versus non-gamified) weight loss program and/or ICT (versus sham) promotes greater improvements in weight, diet, and physical activity; whether these treatment factors have combinatory or synergistic effects; to test whether postulated mechanisms of action (increased engagement, for gamification, and inhibitory control, for ICT) mediate treatment effects; and whether baseline gameplay frequency and implicit preferences for ICT-targeted foods moderate effects. It is hoped this study will contribute to improved mHealth programs for men and enhance our understanding of the impact of gamified elements and neurocognitive training on weight control. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Gamified antimicrobial decision support app (GADSA) changes antibiotics
prescription behaviour in surgeons in Nigeria: a hospital-based pilot
study
IS  - 1
VL  - 12
AB  - Aims Surgical Antibiotic Prophylaxis (SAP) in Nigeria is often not
evidence based. The aim of this study is to test if the GADSA
application can change prescription behaviour of surgeons in Nigeria. In
addition, the study aims to identify AMS strategies and policies for the
future.Methods The GADSA gamified decision support app uses WHO and
Sanford prescribing guidelines to deliver real-time persuasive
technology feedback to surgeons through an interactive mentor. The app
can advise on whether clinician's decisions align with SAP
recommendations and provides the opportunity for clinicians to make
adjustments. Twenty surgeons actively participated in a 6-month pilot
study in three hospitals in Nigeria. The surgeons determined the risk of
infection of a surgical procedure, and the need, type and duration of
SAP. The study used a longitudinal approach to test whether the GADSA
app significantly changed prescribing behaviour of participating
surgeons by analysing the reported prescription decisions within the
app.Results 321 SAP prescriptions were recorded. Concerning the surgical
risk decision, 12\% of surgeons changed their decision to be in line
with guidelines after app feedback (p < 0.001) and 10\% of surgeons
changed their decision about the need for SAP (p = 0.0035) to align with
guidelines. The change in decision making for SAP use in terms of
``type{''} and ``duration{''} to align with guidelines was similar with
6\% and 5\% respectively (both p-values < 0.001).Conclusion This study
suggests that the GADSA app, with its game based and feedback feature,
could significantly change prescribing behaviour at the point of care in
an African setting, which could help tackle the global challenge of
antibiotic resistance.

TI  - Gaming disorder: A summary of its characteristics and aetiology
VL  - 122
AB  - The emergence, development, and maintenance of gaming disorder (GD) is the result of an interplay between gaming-related factors, individual factors, and environmental factors. None of these alone are sufficient to cause a disordered state, but it is the interactive co-occurrence of all these factors, which in some cases leads to GD. The goal of the present paper is to discuss in detail these three factors based on relevant and recent findings of the literature. Among gaming-related factors, we discuss online vs. offline videogames, the role of game genres, structural characteristics, game design elements, as well as some important monetization techniques. Among individual factors demographic risk factors, personality traits, motivational factors, comorbid psychopathology, genetic predisposition, and neurobiological processes are considered. Finally, among environmental factors we discuss family factors, early life experiences, the role of peers and school-related factors, as well as the broader context of culture including the popularity of esports. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - Gaming for Safer Sex: Young German and Turkish People Report No Specific
Culture-Related Preferences Toward Educational Games Promoting Safer Sex
IS  - 6
VL  - 5
AB  - Objective: Comprehensive sex education programs specifically designed
for adolescents and young adults that take into account gender norms and
cultural background have shown promise as a means of countering the high
sexually transmitted infection rate in young people. Recently, digital
gaming interventions delivered on computers or mobile devices have
emerged as another way to promote safer sex behavior in a young
population. Tailoring these computer-based interventions to their target
population has been recognized to increase positive behavior outcomes.
In this qualitative study, we investigated whether young female and male
adults from two different cultural backgrounds (all living in Germany)
would have different preferences and needs in relation to an educational
game promoting safer sex. Materials and Methods: We conducted four
semistructured focus group interviews comprising open-ended questions
with male and female participants who had either a German or a Turkish
background. In total, 20 individuals, aged between 18 and 22 years, from
two socially diverse and ethnically mixed vocational schools in Germany
participated. Results: Independent of cultural background and gender,
participants preferred a real-world design with a first-person visual
perspective over a fantasy-like third-person perspective. Furthermore,
they preferred highly customizable avatars. All participants mentioned
the importance of including an alcohol-intoxicated avatar and most
participants wanted there to be additional information available about
various safer sex approaches and about the use of different barrier
protection methods. Males and females reported similar preferences for
the design of an educational game promoting safer sex, with the only
difference being exactly how the topic of having sexual intercourse
should be addressed in the game. Males preferred a direct approach,
whereas females had a preference for treating this subject more
sympathetically. Conclusion: Educational games offer anonymity and can
provide young people across different cultural backgrounds with
gender-tailored opportunities to experiment with specific safer sex
precautions in a nonthreatening virtual environment, free from unwanted
parental control and peer monitoring.

TI  - Gender Differences in Committee Decision-Making: Process and Outputs in an Experimental Setting
IS  - 3
VL  - 25
AB  - Theories of gender difference suggest that women and men are motivated by different concerns when participating in allocative decision-making processes such as those engaged in by legislative committees. Using a game theoretic experimental design which simulates an allocative decision-making process, this study seeks to identify how women's distinctiveness affects both the process and outputs of committee decision-making. In this design, participants negotiate an outcome with other members of a group and, through majority rule, arrive at a group decision. Following the experiment, participants complete a brief survey instrument. The results show that women are more likely than men to report being motivated by altruistic concerns and to have a preference for a universalistic solution. Men are more likely than women to report being motivated by self-interest and to have a preference for a competitive solution. The increased presence of women in decision-making groups results in a significant impact on both the process and outputs of committee decision-making. © 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

TI  - Gender Differences when Adopting Avatars for Educational Games
AB  - Avatars act as digital representations of players or non-playing characters in games and other online environments, and also play a key role key in educational games. This study looks at gender differences that may impact on human avatar interactions, exploring the impact of player gender differences and avatar gender differences that might impact on acceptance of game technology for education. We also consider gender preferences for avatars across a range of subject areas. We survey 332 participants and examine general acceptance of educational games using the UTAUT framework. We find both males (n=202) and females (n=131) rank performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and hedonic motivation, along with their behavioural intention to use the technology favourably, although female rankings on all scales are significantly lower than male ratings. This suggests less confidence in females for adopting game technology for use in education. Participants also ranked a series of 5 male and 5 female avatars on how well they might be applied to various educational domains. In most cases, the male and female participants rank avatars consistently, although there are a few exceptions. Most evident is the way the female avatars and male avatars are ranked for use in educational games, indicating clear preferences by users for how avatar gender should be selected.

AB  - As we live in a culture where "everything can be commodified, measured and calculated and can be put in the competitive market for sale, detached from its roots and purpose," there is need to redefine our humanness in terms of the changing nature of science, technology, and their deeper impact on human life. More than anything else, it is Information Technology that now has tremendous influence on all spheres of our life, and in a sense, IT has become the destiny of our life. And this is where the real trauma lies. On the one hand, our being in the cyberspace opens up new and exciting horizons before us; on the other hand, we ourselves are changed and transformed in the process. The virtual world transforms human users to a problem-solver technocrat. The speed at which Information Technology is changing the way that youth around the world are socializing, playing, and researching, it is the common practice now for a 15-year old to go home and update their MySpace page, followed by playing online games, or looking up the new trendy YouTube video. These forms of technology are often the topic of adolescent conversations as YouTube, blogs, e-magazines, Face book, MySpace, iPhones, and iPods dominate the commercial and social networking market. Some researchers refer to this phenomenon as ubiquitous technology drawing attention to the fact that ubiquitous technology acknowledges the speedy adoption of day-to-day use of technology as a global phenomenon. In this background, this article aims at revisiting the question, "What is to be human in the era of Ubiquitous Technology?" From a feminist perspective, one can still redefine the boundaries between femininity and masculinity in the context of IT and its impact on our lifestyle and thought style. While examining the ways in which our definitions of "woman" and "man" are shifting in this new communication environment, Elizabeth Lane Lawley observes that we cannot fix a single center from which the experiences of women with computer and communication systems can be viewed and that such fixity would only serve to deepen inequities rather than exposing and removing them. She finally submits, "It is possible to use new theoretical perspectives on the shifting boundaries of gender definitions to rethink a previously deterministic view of the effect of new technologies on society, and particularly the effect of those technologies on women. While the gradual absence of the subject from the field of Artificial Intelligence leads to the invisibility of feminine care along with social and relational nature of man, some feminists dismiss the biological sex distinction on such issues and encourage females to 'imitate man' and to become more aggressive, assertive and dominating" (Lawley 1993). What are the possible impacts of this new technology on the so-called feminine traits of our human nature? How far our definitions of "woman" and "man" are shifting in this new communication environment? This is what this article seeks to explore. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

TI  - Gender-specific effects of depression and suicidal ideation in prosocial behaviors
IS  - 9
VL  - 9
AB  - Background: Prosocial behaviors are essential to the ability to relate to others. Women typically display greater prosocial behavior than men. The impact of depression on prosocial behaviors and how gender interacts with those effects are not fully understood. We explored the role of gender in the potential effects of depression on prosocial behavior. Methods: We examined prosocial behaviors using a modified version of the Trust Game in a clinical population and community controls. Study participants were characterized on the severity of depression and anxiety, presence of suicidal ideation, history of childhood trauma, recent stressful life events, and impulsivity. We correlated behavioral outcomes with gender and clinical variables using analysis of variance and multiple regression analysis. Results: The 89 participants comprised four study groups: depressed women, depressed men, healthy women and healthy men (n = 16-36). Depressed men exhibited reciprocity more frequently than healthy men. Depression induced an inversion of the gender-specific pattern of self-centered behavior. Suicidal ideation was associated with increased reciprocity behavior in both genders, and enhancement of the effect of depression on gender-specific self-centered behavior. Conclusions: Depression, particularly suicidal ideation, is associated with reversal of gender-specific patterns of prosocial behavior, suggesting abnormalities in sexual hormones regulation. This explanation is supported by known abnormalities in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axes found in depression. © 2014 Cáceda et al.

TI  - Gotta catch'em all! Pokémon GO and physical activity among young adults: Difference in differences study
VL  - 355
AB  - Objective To estimate the effect of playing Pokémon GO on the number of steps taken daily up to six weeks after installation of the game. Design Cohort study using online survey data. Participants Survey participants of Amazon Mechanical Turk (n=1182) residing in the United States, aged 18 to 35 years and using iPhone 6 series smartphones. Main outcom e measures Number of daily steps taken each of the four weeks before and six weeks after installation of Pokémon GO, automatically recorded in the "Health" application of the iPhone 6 series smartphones and reported by the participants. A difference in difference regression model was used to estimate the change in daily steps in players of Pokémon GO compared with non-players. Results 560 (47.4%) of the survey participants reported playing Pokémon GO and walked on average 4256 steps (SD 2697) each day in the four weeks before installation of the game. The difference in difference analysis showed that the daily average steps for Pokémon GO players during the first week of installation increased by 955 additional steps (95% confidence interval 697 to 1213), and then this increase gradually attenuated over the subsequent five weeks. By the sixth week after installation, the number of daily steps had gone back to pre-installation levels. No significant effect modification of Pokémon GO was found by sex, age, race group, bodyweight status, urbanity, or walkability of the area of residence. Conclusions Pokémon GO was associated with an increase in the daily number of steps after installation of the game. The association was, however, moderate and no longer observed after six weeks.

TI  - Health and Fitness App Use in College Students: A Qualitative Study
IS  - 4
VL  - 46
AB  - Background: College students experience weight gain that can contribute to serious health issues. Health education efforts with college students are increasingly utilizing new technologies. Smartphone applications (apps) in particular are growing in popularity and use in all young adults. Purpose: Formative research was conducted to describe how college students in the southwestern United States use health/fitness apps to change behavior. Method: College students (n = 27) ages 18-30 reporting use of health/fitness apps were recruited on a large public university campus and participated in interviews about app choice, behavioral goals, features, and reasons for continued use. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes using a 4-person coding team and the qualitative research software NVivo. Results: Most participants downloaded an app to meet a goal and felt that the app helped them meet it. Two distinct groups emerged, those who used apps to support an established behavior and those who used them to adopt a new behavior. The majority of participants reported that acceptable apps were free, easy to use, provided visual/auditory cues, and had game-like rewards. Most participants strongly opposed linking their social media with apps and did not use those features. Discussion: College students use apps to meet different goals such as developing an exercise routine or improving eating habits. Examining what influences health/fitness app choices among college students may provide important insights for future interventions developed to promote app use over long periods of time. Translation to Health Education Practice: Health education programming may benefit from the use of apps, because college students are already adopting these technologies. Features that are important such as ease of use and game-like rewards can help health educators choose appropriate apps for college student programs. © 2015, Copyright © SHAPE America.

TI  - Health Care Gamification: A Study of Game Mechanics and Elements
IS  - 3
VL  - 24
AB  - Internet users are searching for healthcare-related information at unprecedented rates. However, health researchers and providers have only just begun to utilize new technologies to deliver medical education online and through smartphone-based applications. Gamification, an increasingly popular method to produce positive behavioral change, has become a source of interest for private industry as well as academic researchers. In this review, we conducted literature searches to provide an initial framework for researchers to classify gamification studies. We provide a short list of popular gamification elements to help develop a definition for gamification in healthcare. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Health Information and Monitoring of Sexually Transmitted Infections (SIM study): a single-center, parallel, three-arm randomized controlled trial protocol for enhancing adherence to syphilis treatment and follow-up
IS  - 1
VL  - 23
AB  - Background: Syphilis has recently resurfaced as a significant public health problem. Since the 2000s, isolated syphilis outbreaks have increasingly occurred in North America, Europe, and Australia; in Brazil, there have been progressive increases in both congenital and acquired syphilis. There are several possible explanations, such as misdiagnosis of acquired syphilis, which could increase the number of untreated transmitters in the population; failure to initiate or complete treatment; and nontreatment of sexual partners (leading to reinfection). Mobile technologies have been successfully used to promote behavior changes and can positively impact treatment and follow-up adherence in patients with infectious diseases. The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate treatment and monitoring methods in patients with syphilis, including follow-up by telephone, via a game in a smartphone app, and at public health centers. Methods: The SIM study is a single-center, randomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up period. The aim is to identify the most effective method of follow-up regarding patient compliance with treatment. The tests will be performed in a mobile unit in easily accessible locations. The goal is to perform 10,000 rapid tests for syphilis. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis according to VDRL tests will be randomized to one of three arms: telephone, smartphone game, or conventional in-person follow-up. All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Conclusion: If we find differences in effectiveness, a major change in the conventional approach for this patient population may be needed, potentially affecting current Brazilian health policy strategies.

TI  - Health-related internet usage and design feature preference for e-mental health programs among men and women
IS  - 3
VL  - 21
AB  - Background: Major depressive episodes (MDEs) are prevalent in the workplace and affect workers’ health and productivity. Therefore, there is a pressing need for innovation in the prevention of MDEs in the workplace. Electronic mental (e-mental) health programs are a cost-effective approach toward the self-management of stress and emotional issues. E-mental health dropout rate, MDE prevalence, and symptoms greatly vary by sex and age. Thus, the development and implementation of e-mental health programs for the prevention of MDEs need to be examined through a sex and age lens to enhance program use and effectiveness. Objective: This study aimed to examine design feature preferences based on sex and age for an e-mental health program targeted toward depression prevention. Methods: Household residents across Canada were contacted using the random digit dialing method. 500 women and 511 men who were 18 years and older and who were at high risk of having MDEs were interviewed. Internet use was assessed using questions from the 2012 Canadian Internet Use Survey conducted by Statistics Canada, and preferred design features of e-mental health program questions were developed by the BroMatters team members. The proportions of likely use of specific features of e-mental health programs in women were estimated and compared with those in men using chi-square tests. The comparisons were made overall and by age groups. Results: Men (181/511, 35.4%) and women (211/500, 42.2%) differed significantly in their likelihood of using an e-mental health program. Compared with men (307/489, 62.8%), women (408/479, 85.2%) were more likely to use the internet for medical or health-related information. Women were more likely to use the following design features: practices and exercises to help reduce symptoms of stress and depression (350/500, 70.7%), a self-help interactive program that provides information about stress and work problems (302/500, 61.8%), the ability to ask questions and receive answers from mental health professionals via email or text message (294/500, 59.9%), and to receive printed materials by mail (215/500, 43.4%). Men preferred to receive information in a video game format (156/511, 30.7%). Younger men (46/73, 63%) and younger women (49/60, 81%) were more likely to access a program through a mobile phone or an app, and younger men preferred having access to information in a video game format. Conclusions: Factors such as sex and age influenced design feature preferences for an e-mental health program. Working women who are at high risk for MDEs preferred interactive programs incorporating practice and exercise for reducing stress, quality information about work stress, and some guidance from professionals. This suggests that sex and age should be taken into account when designing e-mental health programs to meet the needs of individuals seeking help via Web-based mental health programs and to enhance their use. ©Rachel Smail-Crevier, Gabrielle Powers, Chelsea Noel, JianLi Wang.

TI  - Health self-advocacy training for persons with intellectual disabilities
IS  - 11
VL  - 56
AB  - Background: People with intellectual disabilities (ID) have unequal access to health care. While systemic efforts are addressing health inequalities, there remains a need to demonstrate that persons with ID can increase their health self-advocacy skills. Method: A randomised control design with up to 6-month follow-up was used to evaluate the 3Rs (Rights, Respect and Responsibility) health self-advocacy training program for persons with ID (n=31). Training involved teaching participants to recognise and redress health rights violations in the context of respect and responsibility. Training materials included PowerPoint slides and interactive video scenarios illustrating health rights, respect and responsibility problem and non-problems. Two-hour training sessions were conducted twice a week in a group format where participants played a game and answered questions. Results: The health rights training group made significantly more correct responses on post training and follow-up tests than the control group. Training effects generalised to untrained scenarios and in situ health interviews. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that persons with ID can learn complex skills related to health self-advocacy. More research is needed to improve in situ generalisation. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Healthy Jeart. Developing an app to promote health among young people
IS  - 3
VL  - 25
AB  - Healthy Jeart is a free app targeted to young people. It is especially designed to foster a healthy lifestyle. Young people can find in it practical recommendations about seven areas of health and a game through which they can consolidate the acquired knowledge on different healthy and beneficial elements. Healthy Jeart is also useful for healthcare professionals and educators. The latter can find in it educational proposals in the subject that can be implemented in schools and challenges in which they can get students to participate and compete. Healthy Jeart has been awarded the distinction of Health App by the Andalusian Agency for Health Quality and is supported by the Community Nursing Association (CNA) at the national level. Healthy Jeart is a health promotion tool that was created with a low cost; however, the impact on the physical, psychological and social well-being of young people is expected to be high. The present article describes its design, production, revision and evaluation process. The design of this tool required knowing how young people perceived it and determining the contents that should be included in it. Such information was gathered through eight nominal groups. Once the first prototype was available, this was tested with a sample of adolescent students. With the accreditation procedure, given the attended improvements to pass it, the current version of the application was reached. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Herbopolis – A mobile serious game to educate players on herbal medicines
VL  - 39
AB  - Background: Use of herbal medicines is common. There is a need for education in this area. Mobile games are useful educational tools for motivating learning. A mobile game on herbal medicines can potentially enhance players’ herb-related knowledge. Our objective was to develop a mobile game to motivate players to learn more about herbal medicines. Methods: Game development comprised of storyboarding, user interface design, database development, server development and distribution. A pilot usability study was conducted for the game prototype. Data was gathered through user registration, background data collection and a post-game survey containing a quiz on herbs encountered in the game. Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used for data analysis. Results: “Herbopolis” is an in-house developed mobile game of the simulation genre. Players are tasked to manage a city specializing in the production and sale of herbal products. Nineteen out of 24 participants downloaded and played the game, and completed the post-game survey. Heuristic evaluations for usability, playability and educability were generally positive. Strong positive associations were observed between player level (r = 0.810, p < 0.001) and gameplay time (r = 0.757, p < 0.001) with quiz scores. Female players scored higher in the quiz (p =.044), played for more days (p =.010) and attained higher levels (p =.010) than male players. Conclusion: Players are motivated to learn about herb-related information through playing “Herbopolis”. Our results support its use for improving knowledge on herbal medicines. Future game iterations to improve robustness and performance will likely to improve its reception and effectiveness in learning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 educational assessment of young adults in rural southwest Virginia
IS  - 6
VL  - 12
AB  - Purpose: Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) causes genital herpes, one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the U.S. HSV-1, commonly associated with cold sores, is increasing as a cause of genital herpes. Abstinence-only sexual health classes, commonly taught in Virginia, generate young adults who are under-educated in sexual health, increasing STI risks. College students in southwest Virginia were surveyed to assess comprehensiveness of high school health education regarding HSV-1 and HSV-2 and to identify students' preferred methods for STI education. Methods: To obtain data on knowledge of HSV, comprehensiveness of sexual health education in high school, and preferred learning methods, 237 college students participated in an online questionnaire and 28 students were interviewed using structured interviews. Results: Questionnaire and interview data indicated that Family Life Education classes need to include more comprehensive information on prevention, viral transmission, and differences between HSV-1 and HSV-2. The majority of total respondents (both the questionnaire and interview) (65%) reported non-comprehensive high school sexual health education. The majority of interview (79%) and questionnaire (55%) respondents wished they had learned more about herpes and other STIs in high school. Education preferences of both interviewed and surveyed respondents included interactive internet programs or games, more realistic lectures, and learning about STIs later in high school when students reported greater sexual activity. Conclusion: Our results indicate that more comprehensive sexual health education is needed and wanted by students in southwest Virginia. More relevant educational programs should be implemented for VA high school students utilizing technology and interactive methods to improve student engagement in sexual health education. Implications and contribution: These studies provide information on knowledge of herpes simplex viruses among college students, comprehensiveness of sexual health education received in high schools, and preferred methods to learn about HSV and other STIs. These studies inform the facilitation of improved health education practices and programs for high school and college students. © 2017 Hover, Bertke.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

TI  - HIV/AIDS: Preliminary health promotion activity based on service-learning principles in Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South Africa
IS  - 1
VL  - 47
AB  - Objectives To investigate the effects of a service-learning based health promotion elective on knowledge of HIV & AIDS and ways to prevent them. Method A computer-based quiz, an information poster, an interactive board game and a take-home information leaflet on HIV/AIDS were developed by final year pharmacy students under supervision, as part of an exhibit during the 2009 National Festival of Science and Technology (SciFest) held in Grahamstown, South Africa. Predominantly school learners took part in the quiz and other educational activities. Results The majority (53.1%) of the 179 junior quiz participants were male learners and the majority (63.6%) of the 253 senior quiz participants were female learners. Results of the pre-intervention scores demonstrate fair knowledge of HIV/AIDS with 64.5% and 71.3% for the junior and senior school participants, respectively. Educational interventions resulted in improvement in the number of correct answers to some of the questions. The results showed significant gender differences for the pre- and post-intervention mean percentage scores among the junior quiz participants and only in the pre-intervention scores of the senior quiz participants. Conclusion The health promotion elective was successful in raising awareness of HIV/AIDS but continuous, concerted health promotion activities and advocacy by all health care professionals is needed to address the prevention of HIV/AIDS.

TI  - Holistic darwinism
IS  - 1
VL  - 27
AB  - Holistic Darwinism is a candidate name for a major paradigm shift that is currently underway in evolutionary biology and related disciplines. Important developments include (1) a growing appreciation for the fact that evolution is a multilevel process, from genes to ecosystems, and that interdependent coevolution is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature; (2) a revitalization of group selection theory, which was banned (prematurely) from evolutionary biology over 30 years ago (groups may in fact be important evolutionary units); (3) a growing respect for the fact that the genome is not a "bean bag" (in biologist Ernst Mayr's caricature), much less a gladiatorial arena for competing selfish genes, but a complex, interdependent, cooperating system; (4) an increased recognition that symbiosis is an important phenomenon in nature and that symbiogenesis is a major source of innovation in evolution; (5) an array of new, more advanced game theory models, which support the growing evidence that cooperation is commonplace in nature and not a rare exception; (6) new research and theoretical work that stresses the role of nurture in evolution, including developmental processes, phenotypic plasticity, social information transfer (culture), and especially the role of behavioral innovations as pacemakers of evolutionary change (e.g., niche construction theory, which is concerned with the active role of organisms in shaping the evolutionary process, and gene-culture coevolution theory, which relates especially to the dynamics of human evolution); (7) and, not least, a broad effort to account for the evolution of biological complexity from major transition theory to the "Synergism Hypothesis." Here I will briefly review these developments and will present a case for the proposition that this paradigm shift has profound implications for the social sciences, including specifi cally political theory, economic theory, and political science as a discipline. Interdependent superorganisms, it turns out, have played a major role in evolution from eukaryotes to complex human societies.

TI  - Home-Based Intelligent Exercise System for Seniors’ Healthcare: The Example of Golf Croquet
IS  - 11
VL  - 11
AB  - In 2020, the world experienced the threat of the COVID-19 epidemic, and seniors and chronic disease patients generally reduced their exercise and social activities to avoid increasing the risk of infection, which could lead to increased loneliness and even many diseases. Combining golf croquet games with a mobile application (App) and AIoT companion robots, this research constructs a home-based intelligent exercise system, uses the technology acceptance model (TAM), deduces users’ intention to use this system based on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and adds the needs of love and belonging, esteem, cognitive, aesthetic, and self-actualization in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory (HNT) to conduct an analysis of system needs. This study collected empirical data, totaling 320 participants including seniors and their caregivers, from elderly care centers in northern Taiwan using a cross-sectional survey and purposive sampling. Based on regression and variance analysis, the results show that participants have a high level of acceptance of this system, believing that it is easy to learn and operate and can increase interaction with others, improve self-confirmation, satisfy the thirst for knowledge, increase the feeling of happiness, and fulfill self-actualization needs. In the future, by collecting and recording the process of seniors using the App, so as to find out their health problems as soon as possible, expand their daily life through this exercise, and achieve the goal of happy living and better healthcare. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Home-based screen time behaviors amongst youth and their parents:
familial typologies and their modifiable correlates
IS  - 1
VL  - 20
AB  - Background: Excessive screen time behaviors performed by children and
parents at home is a major public health concern. Identifying whether
child and parent screen time behaviors cluster and understanding
correlates of these familial clusters can help inform interventions for
the whole family. This study characterized familial typologies of screen
time behaviors and identified key modifiable correlates of these
typologies.
Methods: Parents participating in the cross-sectional Sitting in the
Home (SIT) study reported the duration (mins/day) they and their child
(aged 11.2 +/- 2.62 years) spent in six screen time behaviors at home
(computer/laptop for home/work, computer/laptop for leisure,
TV/videos/DVDs, tablet/smart phone for home/work, tablet/smart phone for
leisure, and electronic games) and completed items related to 21
potential correlates framed by an adapted Social Cognitive Theory,
Family Perspective. Latent Class Analysis was used to identify
typologies based on parent and child data for the six behaviors.
Multinomial logistic regression analysis assessed the relative risk of
typology membership for each potential correlate, adjusting for child
and parent age and sex.
Results: The sample comprised 542 parent-child dyads (parents: 40.7 +/-
6.3 yrs., 94\% female; children: 11.2 +/- 2.6 yrs., 46\% female). Three
typologies were identified: 1) high computer/moderate TV (n = 197); 2)
high TV/tablet/smartphone, low computer (n = 135); and 3) low-screen
users (n = 210). `Low-screen users' spent the least amount of time in
all screen time behaviors (assigned as reference category). Greater
child preference for screen time behaviors, parental support for screen
time behaviors and frequency of homework requiring a tablet/laptop were
associated with higher odds of being in the `high computer/moderate TV
typology. The odds of being in the `high TV/tablet/smartphone, low
computer' typology were greater amongst children with a higher
preference for screen time behaviors, and lower among more active
parents.
Conclusions: Three familial typologies of screen time behaviors were
identified. The findings highlight that screen time in the home can be
influenced by the home environment, parental behaviours and role
modelling, child preferences as well as school policies. Findings can
inform the development of family screen time interventions, however more
research exploring the influence of factors outside of the home is
warranted.

TI  - Hot, horny and healthy-online intervention to incentivize HIV and
sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing among young Mexican MSM: a
feasibility study
IS  - 3
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: Encouraging Mexican men who have sex with men (MSM) to learn
about and get tested for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) is
essential not only to initiate early treatment and reduce complications
related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) but also to avoid
new infections. HIV testing for MSM in Mexico remains a challenge, in
part because of the stigma and discrimination they face in their daily
lives and perceived discrimination in health care services. Thus,
innovative approaches are needed to increase the uptake of health
prevention services among this population. Games for health and
gamification are now established approaches to achieving desired
behavior change. Gamified interventions have been successfully deployed
in various health domains, including HIV awareness, treatment, and
prevention. The aim of this 2015 study was to develop a phone-based game
and linked online platform with gamification elements to incentivize HIV
and sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing, normalize asking
partners about serostatus, and increase HIV and STI knowledge among
young Mexican MSM. This paper describes its implementation process and
feasibility assessment.
Methods: The study consisted of three phases. The first phase was the
formative research, which consisted of 6 focus groups and rapid
prototyping to determine the most effective and appropriate design for
the intervention. The second phase consisted of piloting and
implementing the intervention over five weeks among 62 MSM, aged between
18 and 35 years old. Lastly, we assessed the feasibility of the
intervention over three dimensions: acceptability, demand, and
implementation. We conducted ten semi-structured interviews with
participants and used a mixed-methods approach, including qualitative
and quantitative evaluation methods.
Results: Overall, the conceptual components of the intervention were
perceived as acceptable, which leads us to believe that the formative
phase captured our participants' needs and perceptions. However, we
underestimated the complexity of the technical challenges involved.
Participants' high standards and expectations of an interactive product
based on their experience with industrially produced games impacted
their patterns of use. Nevertheless, they perceived the platform as a
good-quality information source. Gamification elements such as badges,
points, and prizes were perceived as fun, exciting, and motivating, and
71\% of participants engaged in at least one activity to earn points.
Conclusions: A game-based intervention, coupled with an online platform
that incorporates gamification elements to motivate HIV and STI testing
in young Mexican MSM is feasible. Successfully scaling such an
intervention to a broader audience would require reducing the complexity
of the intervention, working with a local technical partner to develop
and implement a more efficient platform, improving the quality of the
graphics, and a re-design of the point system.

TI  - How players value their characters in world of warcraft
AB  - Characters in games such as World of Warcraft allow players to act in the game world and to interact with others. Game characters and avatars are a mediated form of self-representation for the player, but some research suggests that players also view characters in other ways that have to do with the kinds of value that the characters provide. To better understand the ways that players value their characters in an online environment, we carried out a semi-structured interview study of twenty World of Warcraft players. From our data we identify ten kinds of value that characters can provide -- including utility, investment, communication, memory, enjoyment, and representations of relationships, as well as value as an opportunity for experience, creativity, sociability, and self-expression. The analytical lens of value provides a new understanding of the ways that players appreciate characters in online multi-user worlds. Our results can help developers understand and enhance an element of multi-player games that contributes greatly to player experience and satisfaction.

TI  - How Self-Esteem Shapes our Interactions with Play Technologies
AB  - The experience that results from video game play is shaped by the play environment, but also by various characteristics of the person playing. We investigated how player self-esteem predicts post-game motivation (enjoyment, effort, and tension), and conducted mediated regressions to show that players' self-esteem alters post-play motivation by affecting how needs are satisfied during play. We also explored how self-esteem predicts post-play positive and negative affect and conducted mediated regressions to show how motivation partially mediates those effects. Our work suggests that players with different levels of self-esteem experience games differently; but more importantly, we provide an explanation of how these differences form by examining the mechanisms during games that ultimately contribute to player experience. Situating our results within theories of self, we discuss the importance of self-esteem for understanding player experience, describe the implications for games research, and consider how self-esteem shapes our interactions with play technologies.

TI  - How to facilitate self-regulated learning? A case study on open educational resources
IS  - 1
VL  - 7
AB  - This paper investigates the students’ self-regulated learning in elementary education when traditional teaching method, which is teacher centered in a classroom, is replaced with a blended approach enriched with open educational resources. Various open educational resources such as videos, simulations, and learning games are readily available on the Web. In addition, mobile and classroom technologies, such as portable devices can be considered as teaching tools in education. The good use of these educational resources and technologies can not only assist students’ formal classroom learning but also cultivate the self-regulated learning of students. The i-Classroom implemented in an elementary school adopted a new teaching method, which made use of the online educational resources and information technology, to achieve this goal. Three surveys (Sample size N = 149, N = 168, N = 150) were conducted to investigate the effectiveness of promoting three key aspects of self-regulated learning: learning motivation, planning and management, and self-monitoring. Focus group interviewed was also carried out to collect the feedback in i-classroom learning. The results show that i-Classroom can help students to enhance their ability in self-regulated learning. © 2019, Beijing Normal University.

TI  - Hybrid type 1 randomized controlled trial of a tablet-based application to improve quality of care in child mental health treatment
VL  - 94
AB  - The quality of child mental health care is highly variable in community practice settings. Innovative technology-based solutions may be leveraged to improve quality of care and, in turn, treatment outcomes. This is a protocol paper that describes an innovative study design in which we rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of a tablet-assisted intervention, Supporting Providers and Reaching Kids (SPARK). SPARK consists of a collection of interactive games and activities that are designed to improve provider fidelity and child engagement in evidence-based psychotherapies. The methodology also allows us to explore the implementation and sustainability of a technology-enhanced intervention in more than two dozen community practice settings. This paper includes a description and justification for sample selection and recruitment procedures, selection of assessment measures and methods, design of the intervention, and statistical evaluation of critical outcomes. Novel features of the design include the tablet-based toolkit approach that has strong applicability to a range of child mental health interventions and the use of a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial that allows for the simultaneous investigation of the effectiveness of the intervention and the implementation context. Challenges related to the implementation of a technology-enhanced intervention in existing mental health clinics are discussed, as well as implications for future research and practice. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

IS  - 1
VL  - 55
AB  - Driven by theories of flow and presence, three studies examined the antecedents and consequences of flow across three different video game genres. Structural equation modeling analyses reveal the roles of (1) physical presence in medical simulation games; (2) spatial presence in driving games; and (3) self-presence in avatar-based narrative-driven games. A 3 (skill: low, medium, high) × 3 (challenge: low, medium, high) between-subjects ANOVA indicates that a balance between skill and challenge induces greater flow. Theoretical contributions regarding the relevance of flow to electronic games and practical implications for the design of diverse game genres are discussed. © 2011 Broadcast Education Association.

TI  - If We Build It, Will They Come? A Qualitative Study of Key Stakeholder
Opinions on the Implementation of a Videogame Intervention for Risk
Reduction in Adolescents
IS  - 4
VL  - 5
AB  - Objective: Serious games are emerging as important tools that offer an
innovative approach to teach adolescents behavioral skills to avoid
risky situations. PlayForward: Elm City Stories, an interactive
videogame targeting risk reduction, is currently undergoing evaluation.
Collecting stakeholder data on its acceptability and real-life
implementation strategies is critical for successful dissemination.
Materials and Methods: We collected interview data from four stakeholder
groups regarding incorporating PlayForward into settings with
adolescents. Transcripts were coded, creating a comprehensive code
structure for each stakeholder group. Results: We conducted 40
semi-structured interviews that included 14 adolescents (aged 12-15
years; 10 boys), eight parents/guardians (all women), 12
after-school/school coordinators (nine women), and 14 community partners
(13 women). We identified four themes that reflected stakeholders'
perceptions about how the videogame might be implemented in real-world
settings. (1) Stakeholder groups expressed that the topics of sex,
alcohol, and drugs were not being taught in an educational setting. (2)
Stakeholder groups saw a videogame as a viable option to teach about
sex, alcohol, and drugs. (3) Stakeholder groups thought that the
videogame would fit well into other settings, such as after-school
programs or community organizations. (4) Some stakeholder groups
highlighted additional tools that could help with implementation, such
as manuals, homework assignments, and group discussion questions.
Conclusion: Stakeholder groups supported the game as a delivery vehicle
for targeted content, indicating high acceptability but highlighting
additional tools that would aid in implementation.

TI  - "I'm just here to play games": social dynamics and sociality in an online game site
AB  - There are many web sites that allow people to play board or card games against other human players. These sites offer tools and opportunities for social interaction, but little is known about how people really interact on these sites. To learn more about social dynamics on game sites, we analysed three months of log files from a large site to explore three themes: permanence (whether people formed a long-term association with the site); social interaction (in terms of shared activity and verbal communication); and formation of ties (whether people made contacts with others). Our analyses showed that while the site seems very social when we consider gameplay, the population was highly transient, and people talked very little. To explain these behaviours, we suggest that games and game-based activity should be considered as a legitimate form of human interaction. Our analysis provides new information and new ways of thinking about how game environments can be designed to support many kinds of sociability.

TI  - Immersive Virtual Reality Exergames to Promote the Well-being of Community-Dwelling Older Adults: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Pilot Study
IS  - 6
VL  - 11
AB  - Background: Despite the proven benefits of exercise in older adults, challenges such as access and motivation can deter their engagement. Interactive virtual reality (VR) games combined with exercise (exergames) are a plausible strategy to encourage physical activity among this population. However, there has been little research on the feasibility, acceptability, and potential benefits of deploying at-home VR exergames among community-dwelling older adults. Objective: The objectives of this study are to estimate the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of a co-designed VR exergame in community-dwelling older adults; examine intervention feasibility and assessment protocols for a future large-scale trial; and provide pilot data on outcomes of interest (physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, mood, cognition, perception, and gameplay metrics). Methods: The study will be a remote, 6-week intervention comprising an experimental and a control group. A sample of at least 12 community-dwelling older adults (with no or mild cognitive impairment) will be recruited for each group. Both groups will follow the same study procedures and assessment methods. However, the experimental group will engage with a co-designed VR exergame (Seas The Day) thrice weekly for approximately 20 minutes using the Oculus Quest 2 (Facebook Reality Labs) VR headset. The control group will read (instead of playing Seas The Day) thrice weekly for approximately 20 minutes over the 6-week period. A mixed methods evaluation will be used. Changes in physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, mood, cognition, and perception will be compared before and after acute data as well as before and after the 6 weeks between the experimental (exergaming) and control (reading) groups. Qualitative data from postintervention focus groups or interviews and informal notes and reports from all participants will be analyzed to assess the feasibility of the study protocol. Qualitative data from the experimental group will also be analyzed to assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of at-home VR exergames and explore perceived facilitators of and barriers to uptaking VR systems among community-dwelling older adults. Results: The screening and recruitment process for the experimental group started in May 2021, and the data collection process will be completed by September 2021. The timeline of the recruitment process for the control group is September 2021 to December 2021. We anticipate an estimated adherence rate of ≥80%. Challenges associated with VR technology and the complexity of remote assessments are expected. Conclusions: This pilot study will provide important information on the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a custom-made VR exergaming intervention to promote older adults’ well-being. Findings from this study will be useful to inform the methodology, design, study procedures, and assessment protocol for future large-scale trials of VR exergames with older adults as well as deepen the understanding of remote deployment and at-home use of VR for exercise in older adults. ©Samira Mehrabi, John E Muñoz, Aysha Basharat, Jennifer Boger, Shi Cao, Michael Barnett-Cowan, Laura E Middleton.

TI  - Impact of a multifaceted educational intervention including serious games to improve the management of invasive candidiasis in critically ill patients; [Impacto de una intervención educacional múltiple incluyendo juegos interactivos para la mejora del manejo de la candidiasis invasiva en pacientes críticos]
IS  - 1
VL  - 41
AB  - Objectives Infections caused by Candida species are common in critically ill patients and contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. The EPICO Project (Epico 1 and Epico 2.0 studies) recently used a Delphi approach to elaborate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of this condition in critically ill adult patients. We aimed to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted educational intervention based on the Epico 1 and Epico 2.0 recommendations. Design Specialists anonymously responded to two online surveys before and after a multifaceted educational intervention consisting of 60-min educational sessions, the distribution of slide kits and pocket guides with the recommendations, and an interactive virtual case presented at a teleconference and available for online consultation. Setting A total of 74 Spanish hospitals. Participants Specialists of the Intensive Care Units in the participating hospitals. Variables of interest Specialist knowledge and reported practices evaluated using a survey. The McNemar test was used to compare the responses in the pre- and post-intervention surveys. Results A total of 255 and 248 specialists completed both surveys, in both periods, respectively. The pre-intervention surveys showed many specialists to be unaware of the best approach for managing invasive candidiasis. After both educational interventions, specialist knowledge and reported practices were found to be more in line with nearly all the recommendations of the Epico 1 and Epico 2.0 guidelines, except as regards de-escalation from echinocandins to fluconazole in Candida glabrata infections (p = 0.055), and the duration of antifungal treatment in both candidemia and peritoneal candidiasis. Conclusions This multifaceted educational intervention based on the Epico Project recommendations improved specialist knowledge of the management of invasive candidiasis in critically ill patients. © 2016 Elsevier España, S.L.U. y SEMICYUC

TI  - Impact of an online course on infection control and prevention
competencies
IS  - 2
VL  - 63
AB  - Aim. This paper is a report of a study to examine the impact of an
online course on nurses' and allied healthcare professionals' competency
in infection prevention and control and the influence of organizational
climate on knowledge transfer.
Background. Nosocomial infection, globalization, international travel
and bacterial resistance are among the factors contributing to
heightened awareness of the importance of infection prevention and
control in today's healthcare environment. An online course in infection
control was developed to facilitate the delivery of standardized
training to large numbers of health providers.
Method. A quasi-experimental, pre-and post-test study using
questionnaires and open-ended questions was conducted in 2006 with a
convenience sample of 76 healthcare professionals, the majority of whom
were Registered Nurses.
Findings. Participants made statistically significant increases in their
perceptions of competency in infection control following the course. The
majority were very satisfied with the course and reported that what they
had learned was useful and relevant to their practice. Participants who
worked in supportive organizations that were open to change reported a
higher incidence of knowledge transfer activities. Two course design
features in particular, video and interactive quizzes and games,
motivated learners and enhanced the learning experience.
Conclusion. Online learning can provide ongoing, convenient and
effective access to up-to-date information on best practices in
infection control and prevention. This standardized delivery approach
minimizes demand on limited training resources which are under strain
and gives learners the opportunity to refresh `rusty' infection control
and prevention skills.

TI  - Impact of a Serious Game on the Intention to Change Infection Prevention
and Control Practices in Nursing Homes During the COVID-19 Pandemic:
Protocol for a Web-Based Randomized Controlled Trial
IS  - 12
VL  - 9
AB  - Background: Nursing home residents are at high risk of complications and
death due to COVID-19. Lack of resources, both human and material,
amplifies the likelihood of contamination in these facilities where a
single employee can contaminate dozens of residents and colleagues.
Improving the dissemination of and adhesion to infection prevention and
control (IPC) guidelines is therefore essential. Serious games have been
shown to be effective in developing knowledge and in increasing
engagement, and could motivate nursing home employees to change their
IPC practices.
Objective: Our aim is to assess the impact of ``Escape COVID-19,{''} a
serious game designed to enhance knowledge and application of IPC
procedures, on the intention of nursing home employees to change their
IPC practices.
Methods: We will carry out a web-based randomized controlled trial
following the CONSORT-EHEALTH (Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials of Electronic and Mobile Health Applications and Online
Telehealth) guidelines and incorporating relevant elements of CHERRIES
(Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys). Participants
will be randomized to either the control or the serious game
(intervention) group. First, both groups will be asked to answer a
questionnaire designed to gather demographic data and assess baseline
knowledge. The control group will then receive a quick reminder of the
current national guidelines and links to IPC guidelines for health care
professionals, while the other group will play the game. Both groups
will then have to answer a second questionnaire designed to assess their
willingness to change their IPC practices after having followed their
respective material. After completing this questionnaire, they will be
granted access to the material presented to the group they were not
assigned to and receive a course completion certificate. The primary
outcome will be the proportion of participants willing to change their
IPC practices according to group. Secondary outcomes will include the
analysis of specific questions detailing the exact changes considered by
the participants. Factors associated with participant willingness or
reluctance to change behavior will also be assessed. Attrition will also
be assessed at each stage of the study.
Results: The study protocol has been presented to our regional ethics
committee (Req-2020-01262), which issued a declaration of no objection
as such projects do not fall within the scope of the Swiss federal law
on human research. Data collection began on November 5, 2020, and should
be completed by December 4, 2020.
Conclusions: This study should determine whether ``Escape COVID-19,{''}
a serious game designed to improve compliance with COVID-19 safe
practices, modifies the intention to follow IPC guidelines among nursing
home employees.

TI  - Impact of gamification on green consumption behavior integrating technological awareness, motivation, enjoyment and virtual CSR
IS  - 1
VL  - 13
AB  - Gamification entails integrating game design elements, including rewards, points, competition, and interactive challenges, into non-game contexts to engage and motivate individuals. In the context of green consumption, gamification can encourage individuals to acquire more sustainable consumption behaviors. The proposed study aims to examine the influence of gamification on green consumption behavior among Chinese university students. However, university students are considered an important target group for such interventions due to their technological savvy and high interest in environmental issues. A self-determination theory (SDT) was used to measure the motivating factors of gamification for adopting green consumption behavior—a convenience sampling technique in which survey-based research designs were used to collect the data. A survey was conducted on a sample of 332 university students in China, using a questionnaire with structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the hypotheses and assess the proposed relationships between the variables. The finding of this study reveals that gamification has a significant negative relation with green consumption behavior. Further, technological awareness, hedonic motivation, and perceived enjoyment significantly mediate the relationship between gamification and green consumption behavior. Additionally, virtual CSR significantly moderates the relationship between gamification and technological awareness, hedonic motivation, and perceived enjoyment. The findings of this study could have implications for the development of more effective interventions for policy makers and industrialists aimed at promoting sustainable consumption behaviors in China. © 2023, The Author(s).

IS  - 3
VL  - 27
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between adaptive behaviors of 18- to 24-month-old infants and their parents’ use of technology. For this purpose, a survey research method was used. The sample consisted of 116 people who are 58 volunteering married couples with 18- to 24-month-old infants and were registered in family health centers in Turkey’s Eastern Anatolia Region. Comparison analyses were conducted between parents’ demographic variables (i.e., education background) and their use of technology (i.e., Internet, smartphone) and adaptive behaviors of their 18- to 24-month-old infants. Adaptive behaviors of infants were measured with ABAS-3 (Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Third Edition) and the profiles of parents using technology were measured with a survey developed by the researchers. The results showed that parents’ use of technology had an impact on adaptive behaviors of 18- to 24-month-old infants. Infants of mothers who did not engage in any Internet activity have higher adaptive behavior scores. The infants of mothers who engaged in activities such as games, videos, and music on the Internet together with their 18- to 24-month-old infants had low scores on adaptive behaviors in terms of concept, self-management, leisure, and communication. According to the findings, various suggestions are presented for parents, researchers, and practitioners. © The Author(s) 2019.

TI  - Impact of some types of mass gatherings on current suicide risk in an
urban population: statistical and negative binominal regression analysis
of time series
VL  - 14
AB  - Background: Many studies have investigated the impact of a wide range of
social events on suicide- related behaviour. However, these studies have
predominantly examined national events. The aim of this study is to
provide a statistical evaluation of the relationship between mass
gatherings in some relatively small urban sub- populations and the
general suicide rates of a major city.
Methods: The data were gathered in the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk,
with a population of 1 million people, in 2005-2010. Suicide attempts,
suicides, and the total amount of suicide- related behaviours were
registered daily for each sex. Bivariate and multivariate statistical
analysis, including negative binomial regression, were applied to assess
the risk of suicide- related behaviour in the city's general population
for 7 days before and after 427 mass gatherings, such as concerts,
football games, and non-regular mass events organized by the Orthodox
Church and new religious movements.
Results: The bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses found
significant changes in some suicide- related behaviour rates in the
city's population after certain kinds of mass gatherings. In particular,
we observed an increased relative risk (RR) of male suicide- related
behaviour after a home defeat of the local football team (RR = 1.32, p =
0.047; regression coefficient beta = 0.371, p = 0.002), and an increased
risk of male suicides (RR = 1.29, p = 0.006; beta = 0.255, p = 0.002),
male suicide-related behaviour (RR = 1.25, p = 0.019; beta = 0.251, p <
0.001), and total suicide- related behaviour (RR = 1.23 p < 0.001; beta
= 0.187, p < 0.001) after events organized by the new religious
movements.
Conclusions: Although football games and mass events organized by new
religious movements involved a relatively small part of an urban
population (1.6 and 0.3\%, respectively), we observed a significant
increase of the some suicide-related behaviour rates in the whole
population. It is likely that the observed effect on suicide-related
behaviour is related to one's personal presence at the event rather than
to its broadcast. Our findings can be explained largely in terms of
Gabennesch's theory of the `broken-promises effect'with regard to intra-
and interpersonal conflict and, in terms of crowd behaviour effects.

TI  - Implementation of a Family Intervention to Increase Fruit and Vegetable Intake: The Hi5+ Experience
IS  - 2
VL  - 6
AB  - Family is an important, yet challenging, target for dietary intervention. This article describes the implementation of Hi5+, a family fruit and vegetable (FV) promotion program. Complementing a fourth-grade school curriculum, the seven weekly Family Fun Nites were at-home family meal sharing and game evenings. A sample of families (N = 575; 69% consented) from schools in a southeastern U.S. urban area received tailored intervention materials based on their FV attitudes and family interaction styles. A pyramidal organizational design, using peer leaders, facilitated 71% of families to complete all seven sessions, whereas 84% completed at least one session. Significant independent predictors of program completion were attending an introductory Kick-Off Nite, interactive family style, additional adults in the household, married parents, being African American, earning more than $60,000, and additional children in the household. Familyspecific issues and initial program experience are important considerations for implementing a family intervention. © 2005, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improved functioning following computerized working memory training (COGMED®) in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and cognitive complaints: An exploratory study
VL  - 262
AB  - Background: Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) frequently have cognitive deficits even when euthymic. These deficits are considered one of the main drivers of functional disability in BD. This study investigated whether computerized working memory training using the COGMED® program in patients with BD can improve global functioning, therapeutic compliance, and subjective quality of life. Methods: For this naturalistic prospective study, 40 patients with BD and cognitive complaints were recruited. Sociodemographic, clinical, neurocognitive and functional data were collected before starting the remediation intervention (baseline). At home, patients used the web-based working memory training program COGMED® that included a battery of interactive games (daily sessions, five days per week for five weeks), supported by weekly phone-based feedback. The clinical, neurocognitive and functional assessment was repeated four weeks after the intervention end and compared with the baseline data. Results: Thirty-two patients completed the study. Compared with baseline, general functioning was improved after the working memory training program, as indicated by a mean reduction of 6.78 (SD 4.65) points in the Functioning Assessment Short Test (p<0.001). This result remained significant after controlling for depressive symptomatology improvement. Similarly, the scores of neuropsychological tests for cognitive complaints, as well as verbal and visuospatial working memory components were significantly different before and after the intervention (p<0.05). Conversely, the subjective quality of life and therapeutic compliance did not change. Limitations: The naturalistic open-label, non-controlled design of this study precludes the conclusion regarding causality. Conclusions: In patients with BD, global functioning is improved by computerized working memory remediation. © 2019

TI  - Improving Children's Mental Health with a Digital Social Skills Development Game: A Randomized Controlled Efficacy Trial of Adventures aboard the S.S. GRIN
IS  - 1
VL  - 6
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a computer-based game to improve social skills and mental health in children with social skills deficits would be efficacious. The program, Adventures aboard the S.S. GRIN, translates a proven in-person intervention into a nine-episode interactive online adventure game that provides opportunity for knowledge acquisition and skill practice. Materials and Methods: Participants (children aged 7-11 years with social skills challenges) were randomly assigned to immediate treatment group (n = 33) or waitlist control group (n = 36). Children in the immediate treatment condition completed the game at home over the course of 9 weeks. Before playing the game and again within 1 week of game completion, children completed surveys about social literacy, social anxiety, bullying, social self-efficacy, and social satisfaction. Results: Children who played Adventures improved significantly more from pretest to posttest than children who did not play the game in social literacy, social anxiety, bullying victimization, and social satisfaction. Conclusion: Online interactive games can be effective in improving mental health for children who struggle with social skills. For children who can access them, serious games have the potential to increase the reach of effective programs by overcoming the logistical and implementation barriers (such as cost, travel, and accessibility) that limit traditionally delivered mental health interventions. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.

TI  - Increasing middle school students’ awareness and interest in manufacturing through digital game-based learning (DGBL)
IS  - 5
VL  - 25
AB  - The change of the societal appeal of manufacturing among younger generations is a key element in order to address the talent shortage that is currently affecting the sector. In order to pursue this objective, the use of interactive learning environments such as digital games (DGs) can play an important role. Therefore, this paper presents the results of an exploratory study aimed at understanding the impact of digital gamebased learning (DGBL) on the awareness and interest of middle school students in manufacturing. In particular, the students had to deal with the management of EcoFactory, a simplified industrial plant where they had to take care of the main decisions that are typical in the modern manufacturing industry. The study was based on a pre-test–post-test quasi-experimental design conducted in a public middle school in Northern Italy. The research triangulated the results of different methodologies, namely drawings analysis and questionnaires. The results showed a significant impact of the DG both on the awareness and interest of participants, especially in the environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Thus, the outcomes revealed the high potential that DGs have in explaining the complex concepts that are typical of manufacturing and in enhancing students’ proactive motivation toward them. Finally, implications and suggestions for further research derived from these findings are discussed. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Increasing motivation for cancer treatment adherence in children through a mobile educational game: a pilot study
IS  - 30
VL  - 8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is crucial to educate childhood cancer patients (CCPs) about their illness and motivate them for cancer treatment and treatment side-effects management. OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the design, development and pilot evaluation of the proposed serious game intervention with CCPs in Malaysia. METHODS: A single-centre, single-arm intervention was conducted with CCPs (n=8). Surveys were done pre-test and post-test. RESULTS: The Protection Motivation Theory was used to measure the participants' motivation. Self-reported surveys with CCPs and caregiver dyads showed a significant increase in participants’ intention to use cancer treatment. Although the increase in the intention to use daily self-care and cancer knowledge survey scores was not substantial, the post-test caregivers' feedback revealed that the game was beneficial for their children. CONCLUSION: Early results of the study have shown the intervention’s potential to boost the knowledge and motivations of CCPs. © 2022 Carmen Chai Wang Er et al.,.

TI  - Increasing Nutrition Literacy: Testing the Effectiveness of Print, Web site, and Game Modalities
IS  - 1
VL  - 40
AB  - Objective: To examine the effectiveness of three modalities for delivery of nutrition education. Design: Between-subjects, repeated-measures design. Setting: Data were collected at community agencies or during home visits. Participants: Low-income, European American and African American mothers (N = 155). Intervention: Participants were exposed to nutrition education material in 1 of 3 modalities (a computer game, The Fantastic Food Challenge; Web site; or pamphlet). Likeability, nutrition knowledge, intention to use, and demographic measures followed the intervention at T1 and T2. Main Outcome Measures: 5-point Likert-type scales measured likeability (5 items), and 33 multiple-choice questions measured knowledge. Analysis: Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) procedures using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) software, P < .05. Results: Overall, the Web site was liked more than the other conditions with this audience of women. Significant differences in attention, understanding, and intent to use the information existed across modalities. The Web site performed better than other modalities on knowledge outcomes, with no differences in knowledge retention from T1 toT2. Conclusions and Implications: The Web site modality performed best with this audience of women, indicating that interactive computer games may not confer greater benefits than traditional modes of information delivery for all audiences, particularly those with low computer skills. © 2008 SOCIETY FOR NUTRITION EDUCATION.

TI  - Increasing the athletic group play of children with autism
IS  - 1
VL  - 44
AB  - A multiple baseline design across three children with autism and within child across activity was used to assess the effects of interventions designed to teach children with autism to play two common athletic group games, handball and 4-square. Treatment consisted of two phases. In Phase I, athletic skills training, the children participated in sessions designed facilitate their acquisition of the athletic skills required by the targeted games. During Phase II, rules training, the children were instructed on the rules of the targeted games. Mastering the athletic skills and participating in rules training resulted in increased athletic group play and concomitant increases in speech. These gains were maintained at 8-16 weeks follow-up. However, generalization to participation in school recess activities did not occur. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Individual preferences for voluntary vs. mandatory vaccination policies:
an experimental analysis
IS  - 1
VL  - 30
AB  - Background: More and more countries are discussing the introduction of
mandatory vaccination policies. Yet, little is known about individuals'
actual preferences for voluntary vs. mandatory vaccination policies, and
the psychological processes underlying such preferences. Objective of
the present research was to investigate the development of individual
preferences for voluntary and mandatory vaccination policies. Methods:
We conducted a controlled laboratory study (N = 168) using a repeated
interactive vaccination game with decision-contingent monetary
incentives. In each round, participants decided in favour of either a
voluntary or a mandatory vaccination policy, followed by the vaccination
decision (voluntary policy) or vaccination (mandatory policy) which both
resulted in actual (financial) consequences. Results: We observe large
heterogeneity in participants' preferences for the voluntary vs.
mandatory policy. Under voluntary vaccination, the preference for the
mandatory policy increased with decreasing vaccination rates (and
increasing risk of infection). In contrast, experiencing vaccine-adverse
events under mandatory vaccination increased the preference for the
voluntary policy. The latter effect was larger for individuals with a
negative (vs. positive) attitude toward vaccination. Overall, as
individuals gathered experiences under both the voluntary and the
mandatory policy, the preference for voluntary vaccination policy
increased over time. Conclusions: Individuals are more willing to accept
mandatory vaccination policies when vaccination rates are low. In the
long run, the occurrence of vaccine-adverse events may spark opposition
to mandatory vaccination.

TI  - Infants time their smiles to make their moms smile
IS  - 9
VL  - 10
AB  - One of the earliest forms of interaction between mothers and infants is smiling games. While the temporal dynamics of these games have been extensively studied, they are still not well understood. Why do mothers and infants time their smiles the way they do? To answer this question we applied methods from control theory, an approach frequently used in robotics, to analyze and synthesize goal-oriented behavior. The results of our analysis show that by the time infants reach 4 months of age both mothers and infants time their smiles in a purposeful, goal-oriented manner. In our study, mothers consistently attempted to maximize the time spent in mutual smiling, while infants tried to maximize mother-only smile time. To validate this finding, we ported the smile timing strategy used by infants to a sophisticated child-like robot that automatically perceived and produced smiles while interacting with adults. As predicted, this strategy proved successful at maximizing adult-only smile time. The results indicate that by 4 months of age infants interact with their mothers in a goal-oriented manner, utilizing a sophisticated understanding of timing in social interactions. Our work suggests that control theory is a promising technique for both analyzing complex interactive behavior and providing new insights into the development of social communication. © 2015 Ruvolo et al.

TI  - Influence of Pokémon Go Playing Style on Physical Activity and Its Effect on Kinanthropometry Variables and Body Composition in Adolescents
IS  - 10
VL  - 20
AB  - Background: Pokémon Go is a mobile app that offers both continuous and intermittent (gamified) gameplay, but no previous research in adolescents is known to have addressed changes in physical activity and body composition according to playing style. For this reason, the aims of the present investigation were (1) to establish the differences in the level of physical activity, and its influence on the kinanthropometric and body composition, of the adolescent population, considering their Pokémon Go playing style; and (2) to analyze whether the practice of previous physical activity has an influence on the effects of the use of Pokémon Go on the level of physical activity and changes in kinanthropometric and body composition variables. Methods: A total of 94 adolescents (50 males and 44 females; mean age: 13.66 [1.17] years-old; mean body mass index: 20.82 [4.03] kg/m2) whose physical activity level and body composition were measured, participated in the investigation. Two groups of adolescents completed a 10-week intervention using Pokémon Go continuously (n = 30) or intermittently (n = 31), while the control group (n = 33) did not use any after-school app. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), a multivariate analysis of variance, and 2 repeated-measures ANOVA were performed to analyze the data. Results: Inactive adolescents in the continuous use group increased their physical activity between the pretest and posttest (P = .038), but this did not occur in the active group. Regarding body composition variables, the increase in body mass (P < .001) and body mass index (P = .006) in the control group was significantly higher than in the continuous use group of adolescents who were inactive, but not in the active group, while the decrease in fat mass (P < .001–.036) and sum of 3 skinfolds (P < .001–.003) was significantly higher in both Pokémon Go use groups as compared to the control group, regardless of the previous physical activity level. Conclusions: The continuous style of play seems to be more effective in increasing physical activity in adolescents, but the changes in body composition and kinanthropometric variables occur similarly with continuous and intermittent gameplay. Therefore, the playful use of Pokémon Go can be used in educational and health fields to produce changes in body composition in this population. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.

AB  - Use/abuse of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) has in recent years become a topic of great interest. Current discussion addresses whether it must be considered addictive behaviour and if it is a problem that primarily affects adolescents and youth. This study aims to understand the problems that affect people of all ages in controlling the use of these ICTs and whether they are related to mental health problems, stress and difficulties in executive control of behaviour. A survey was administered through social networks and email, using the MULTICAGE-ICT, a questionnaire that explores problems in the use of Internet, mobile phones, video games, instant messaging and social networks. Additionally, the Prefrontal Symptom Inventory, General Health Questionnaire and Perceived Stress Scale were administered. The sample was comprised of 1,276 individuals of all ages from different Spanish-speaking countries. The results indicate that about 50% of the sample, regardless of age or other variables, presents significant problems with the use of these technologies, and that these problems are directly related to symptoms of poor prefrontal functioning, stress and mental health problems. The results reveal the need for reconsidering whether we are facing an addictive behaviour or a new problem demanding environmental, psychological, sociological and sociopolitical explanations, therefore, it is necessary to reformulate actions to be implemented to address and refocus our understanding of the problem. © 2018, Edita Socidrogalcohol.

TI  - Informing our own choices: A proposal for user-generated classification
IS  - 130
AB  - New media are distrusted media, and computer games are the contemporary currency in new media. Computer game content, like other popular media content, is regulated in different jurisdictions by one of three general models: the open market in which consumption decides the availability of product, industry self-regulation in which industry bodies decide, and government regulation in which government or quasi-governmental bodies decide. Arguably, these models represent the twentieth century state of the art and fail to keep pace with changes in the aesthetics and technologies associated with interactive entertainment. In a networked economy, alternative models exist to serve content gatekeeping functions, and they serve to close the lags and limitations that plague existing models. These alternatives include innovations such as user-generated classification and dynamic meta-tagging. This paper examines current classification approaches and their limitations, and presents alternative approaches with a hypothetical game title.

TI  - In pursuit of a self-sustaining college alcohol intervention: Deploying gamified PNF in the real world
VL  - 80
AB  - Our recent work (Boyle, Earle, LaBrie, & Smith, 2017) showed that the efficacy of personalized normative feedback-based (PNF) college alcohol interventions can be improved through the addition of gamified elements including points, chance, competition, and personal avatars. However, participants in that study were compensated with subject pool credit. In the current study, we piloted an upgraded, smartphone-based version of the game, which was designed to be truly self-sustaining (i.e., engaging enough that students play voluntarily without the presence of external motivators). First-year students were invited to play the game weekly for six rounds, with participants submitting and voting on their own questions each week and receiving a novel type of feedback in addition to standard descriptive PNF: opposite peers' judgments of participants' self-reported drinking behavior, or reflective norms. With no play-based incentives, 222 first-year college students voluntarily played the game, CampusGANDR. ANCOVA models revealed that, relative to participants randomized to receive feedback on control topics during the three intervention rounds, those who received both descriptive and reflective feedback on peer alcohol use had significantly reduced normative perceptions and reduced alcohol use two months post intervention. This was especially true among heavy drinkers. The results suggest that our gamified “GANDR” approach shows promise as a self-sustaining intervention and, further, that high-risk drinkers may benefit disproportionately from this methodology. Thus, self-sustaining interventions represent an encouraging avenue for future research and development and may hold the potential to impact risky college drinking on a large scale. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Interaction of reward seeking and self-regulation in the prediction of risk taking: A cross-national test of the dual systems model
IS  - 10
VL  - 52
AB  - In the present analysis, we test the dual systems model of adolescent risk taking in a cross-national sample of over 5,200 individuals aged 10 through 30 (M = 17.05 years, SD = 5.91) from 11 countries. We examine whether reward seeking and self-regulation make independent, additive, or interactive contributions to risk taking, and ask whether these relations differ as a function of age and culture. To compare across cultures, we conduct 2 sets of analyses: 1 comparing individuals from Asian and Western countries, and 1 comparing individuals from low- and high-GDP countries. Results indicate that reward seeking and self-regulation have largely independent associations with risk taking and that the influences of each variable on risk taking are not unique to adolescence, but that their link to risk taking varies across cultures. © 2016 American Psychological Association.

TI  - Interactive and Connected Tableware for Promoting Children's Vegetable-Eating and Family Interaction
AB  - In this paper, we present an interactive and connected tableware system for promoting children to eat vegetables more. Our system aims to encourage children to eat vegetables more and educate them to understand the benefits of those vegetables. Our system comprises a food tray, a spoon and a smartphone cradle, which named "Healthy Tray", "Healthy Spoon" and "Healthy Cradle" respectively. We also present a mobile application with education and gamification elements connected to our tableware. Healthy Cradle is particularly designed to enhance the interaction and communication between children and their parents while playing the game.We conducted a pilot study with two families. Through the study the child participants who used to hate eating vegetables (e.g., broccoli) changed their attitudes; they had vegetable on their own will while playing the presented education game. After the game ends, they also showed a good knowledge on the benefits of the vegetable that they just had. In addition, we could observe the children participants actively interact with mothers while eating vegetables and playing the game.

TI  - Interactive CovidCampus Simulation Game: Genesis, Design, and Outcomes
VL  - 6
AB  - We explore how an AR simulation created by a multidisciplinary team evolved into a more interactive, student-centered learning game. The CovidCampus experience was designed to help college students understand how their decisions can affect their probability of infection throughout a day on campus. There were eight decision points throughout the day. Within group comparisons of immediate learning gains and self-reported behavioral changes were analyzed. Results revealed a significant increase in confidence in asking safety-related questions. Post-play, a significant majority of players listed new actions they would take to increase their safety; players were more agentic in their choices. This game allowed players to go back and replay with different choices, but only 7% chose to replay. Short, interactive desktop games may be an effective method for disseminating information about how to stay safer during a pandemic. The game appeared to positively change most players' health behaviors related to mitigation of an infectious disease. Designers of interactive health games should strive to create multi-disciplinary teams, include constructs that allow players to agentically make decisions, and to compare outcomes overtime.  © Johnson-Glenberg, Jehn, Chung, Balanzat, Nieland Zavala, Apostol, Rayan, Taylor, Kapadia and Bartolomea.

TI  - Interactive Narrative in a Mobile Health Behavioral Intervention
(Tumaini): Theoretical Grounding and Structure of a Smartphone Game to
Prevent HIV Among Young Africans
IS  - 2
VL  - 7
AB  - The increasing availability of smartphones, including in low-income
countries, offers an unprecedented opportunity to reach individuals with
innovative health promotion interventions. Electronic games delivered
via smartphone offer promising avenues for sexual health promotion and
HIV prevention, especially for young people. By giving players real
agency in a virtual and safe environment, well-designed games can
provide a level of experiential learning unparalleled by many other
behavioral interventions. The design of effective games for health
relies on multidisciplinary insight and expertise. However, relatively
few studies discuss the theoretical understanding underlying their
intervention. Making explicit the theoretical grounding of a game-based
intervention allows articulation of assumptions and strategies,
anticipation of outcomes, and evaluation of impacts (including
intermediate effects), thereby increasing understanding of pathways to
change, with a view to contributing to the development of more effective
games. It also helps strengthen the credibility and improve the
accountability of games for health. We present the multidisciplinary
theoretical framework-integrating intervention design, mediators, and
behavioral outcomes-and the structure of an HIV prevention game for
young African adolescents that has shown promise in a randomized pilot
study in Western Kenya. The central component of Tumaini (hope for the
future in Kiswahili) is an interactive role-playing narrative in which
the player makes choices for characters that determine how their paths
unfold. In addition, a series of mini-games reinforce skills, and the
``My Story{''} component links the game world to the player's own life
and goals, and a reward system motivates continued play. With its
``choose-your-own-adventure{''} format, Tumaini is intended to be
replayed so that players can experience the consequences resulting from
different choices made in the role-playing narrative. Grounded in
theories of narrative and applied communication and in social behavioral
theories, especially Social Cognitive Theory, Tumaini is designed to
help young adolescents acquire the information, skills, and motivation
they need to avoid and reduce sexual risks. We close by situating
Tumaini within discussion of the theory and practice of using
interactive narrative in health promotion, with a view to furthering
theoretical elaboration.

TI  - Interactive videogame as rehabilitation tool of patients with chronic respiratory diseases: Preliminary results of a feasibility study
IS  - 10
VL  - 108
AB  - Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of an interactive videogame (IV) system in addition to a supervised pulmonary rehabilitation programme (PRP) in patients with chronic respiratory diseases.; Design Randomised Controlled Trial comparing standard PRP (20 patients, control group: CG), and PRP + sessions of interactive videogame-aided exercises (20 patients, experimental group: EG). Lung and respiratory muscle function, arterial blood gases, exercise capacity, dyspnoea, health status and health-related quality of life (HRQL) and emotional response were measured before and after PRP. A questionnaire on acceptability of the PRP was administered.; Conclusions The addition of IV training was more effective for improving some parameters of exercise tolerance and dyspnoea, although did not result in better psychological status nor it was better accepted than the standard PRP in patients with chronic respiratory diseases.; Results Exercise capacity, dyspnoea and HRQL significantly improved in both groups after the PRP, whereas the EG showed a greater improvement in six-minute walk test and transitional dyspnoea index than the CG. No difference in psychological status or acceptability of PRP was observed between the two groups. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intercultural perspective on impact of video games on players: Insights from a systematic review of recent literature
IS  - 1
VL  - 20
AB  - The video-game industry has become a significant force in the business and entertainment world. Video games have become so widespread and pervasive that they are now considered a part of the mass media, a common method of storytelling and representation. Despite the massive popularity of video games, their increasing variety, and the diversification of the player base, until very recently little attention was devoted to understanding how playing video games affects the way people think and collaborate across cultures. This paper examines the recent literature regarding the impact of video games on players from an intercultural perspective. Sixty-two studies are identified whose aim is to analyze behavioral-change, content understanding, knowledge acquisition, and perceptional impacts. Their findings suggest that video games have the potential to help to acquire cultural knowledge and develop intercultural literacy, socio-cultural literacy, cultural awareness, self-awareness, and the cultural understanding of different geopolitical spaces, to reinforce or weaken stereotypes, and to some extent also facilitate the development of intercultural skills. The paper provides valuable insights to the scholars, teachers, and practitioners of cultural studies, education, social studies, as well as to the researchers, pointing out areas for future research. © 2020 JESTP.

TI  - Internet addiction, smartphone addiction, and hikikomori trait in Japanese young adult: Social isolation and social network
IS  - JULY
VL  - 10
AB  - Background: As the number of internet users increases, problems related to internet overuse are becoming more and more serious. Adolescents and youth may be particularly attracted to and preoccupied with various online activities. In this study, we investigated the relationship of internet addiction, smartphone addiction, and the risk of hikikomori, severe social withdrawal, in Japanese young adult. Methods: The subjects were 478 college/university students in Japan. They were requested to complete the study questionnaire, which consisted of questions about demographics, internet use, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS)-Short Version (SV), the 25-item Hikikomori Questionnaire (HQ-25), etc. We investigated the difference and correlation of the results between two groups based on the purpose of internet use or the total score of each self-rating scale, such as screened positive or negative for the risk of internet addiction, smartphone addiction, or hikikomori. Results: There was a trend that males favored gaming in their internet use while females used the internet mainly for social networking via smartphone, and the mean SAS-SV score was higher in females. Two-group comparisons between gamers and social media users, according to the main purpose of internet use, showed that gamers used the internet longer and had significantly higher mean IAT and HQ-25 scores. Regarding hikikomori trait, the subjects at high risk for hikikomori on HQ-25 had longer internet usage time and higher scores on both IAT and SAS-SV. Correlation analyses revealed that HQ-25 and IAT scores had a relatively strong relationship, although HQ-25 and SAS-SV had a moderately weak one. Discussion: Internet technology has changed our daily lives dramatically and altered the way we communicate as well. As social media applications are becoming more popular, users are connected more tightly to the internet and their time spent with others in the real world continues to decrease. Males often isolate themselves from the social community in order to engage in online gaming while females use the internet as to not be excluded from their communications online. Mental health providers should be aware of the seriousness of internet addictions and hikikomori. Copyright © 2019 Tateno, Teo, Ukai, Kanazawa, Katsuki, Kubo and Kato.

TI  - Internet and the Smartphone: Really Generate Addiction to the Students? A Theoretical Reflection
IS  - 2
VL  - 6
AB  - Nowadays, communications have innovated with the emergence of the internet and mobile telephony (smartphone). Undoubtedly, this technological innovation has favored every sector of the worldwide population, thanks to the various forms of interaction in communication. Therefore, the aim of this essay focuses on the analysis of the literature about constructs of the internet and Smartphone addiction, and how this symptom has become present in the user population. For this purpose, a review of the literature on the subject is carried out, which allows us to identify some aspects that relate to both constructs. In the final reflections from the analyzed literature, we observe that some elements that most influence internet addiction are: leisure, online games, random games, cybersex, social networks to interact with other people, and sometimes to search for information. About this, it has already been reported in several studies, however, a question arises, has little been seen or at least it was not located, that the use of the internet is being the preferred channel of people to their academic training?, or just forced by the global health contingency? Today, the worldwide activity will no longer be the same after the COVID-19 pandemic that we are suffering from, and it is possible that the teaching-learning processes will frequently be taught through the different electronic media, hence this technology is emerging to be an agent of change in education worldwide. © 2021 The authors.

TI  - Internet and video Game use in relation to overweight in young adults
IS  - 5
VL  - 28
AB  - Purpose. To examine the relationship between interactive media use (Internet and video games) and overweight risk in young adults. Design. Prospective cohort study. Setting. France (TEMPO study). Subjects. Community sample of 674 young adults aged 22 to 35 in 2009 (response rate to the original mail out: 44.3%). Measures. Data were collected through mail-based questionnaires from study participants in 1999 (juvenile overweight, juvenile TV use) and 2009 (overweight, Internet and video game use, regular physical activity), and from their parents who participated in the GAZEL study from 1989 to 2009 (parental overweight). Analysis. Logistic regression. Results. Participants who engaged in regular video game use (>1 time/wk) were more likely to be overweight than those who did not (odds ratio [OR] 2.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-3.42). Adjusting for sex, regular athletic activity, juvenile overweight, juvenile TV use, and parental overweight, the OR associated with video game use decreased but remained statistically significant (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.15-3.28). We found no significant association between Internet use and overweight. Conclusion. Video game use may be a relevant target for interventions aiming to decrease the burden of overweight and associated consequences in young adults.(Am J Health Promot 2014; 28[5]:321-324.) © 2014 by American Journal of Health Promotion, Inc.

TI  - Internet-Based HIV prevention with at-home sexually transmitted infection testing for young men having sex with men: Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial of keep it up! 2.0
IS  - 1
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are increasing among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), yet few HIV prevention programs have studied this population. Keep It Up! (KIU!), an online HIV prevention program tailored to diverse YMSM, was developed to fill this gap. The KIU! 2.0 randomized controlled trial (RCT) was launched to establish intervention efficacy. Objective: The objective of the KIU! study is to advance scientific knowledge of technology-based behavioral HIV prevention, as well as improve public health by establishing the efficacy of an innovative electronic health (eHealth) prevention program for ethnically and racially diverse YMSM. The intervention is initiated upon receipt of a negative HIV test result, based on the theory that testing negative is a teachable moment for future prevention behaviors. Methods: This is a two-group, active-control RCT of the online KIU! intervention. The intervention condition includes modules that use videos, animation, games, and interactive exercises to address HIV knowledge, motivation for safer behaviors, self-efficacy, and behavioral skills. The control condition reflects HIV information that is readily available on many websites, with the aim to understand how the KIU! intervention improves upon information that is currently available online. Follow-up assessments are administered at 3, 6, and 12 months for each arm. Testing for urethral and rectal sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is completed at baseline and at 12-month follow-up for all participants, and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups for participants who test positive at baseline. The primary behavioral outcome is unprotected anal sex at all follow-up points, and the primary biomedical outcome is incident STIs at 12-month follow-up. Results: Consistent with study aims, the KIU! technology has been successfully integrated into a widely-used health technology platform. Baseline enrollment for the RCT was completed on December 30, 2015 (N=901), and assessment of intervention outcomes is ongoing at 3-, 6-, and 12-month time points. Upon collection of all data, and after the efficacy of the intervention has been evaluated, we will explore whether the KIU! intervention has differential efficacy across subgroups of YMSM based on ethnicity/race and relationship status. Conclusions: Our approach is innovative in linking an eHealth solution to HIV and STI home testing, as well as serving as a model for integrating scalable behavioral prevention into other biomedical prevention strategies. © Brian Mustanski, Krystal Madkins, George J Greene, Jeffrey T Parsons, Brent A Johnson, Patrick Sullivan, Michael Bass, Rebekah Abel.

TI  - Internet-based learning and applications for critical care medicine
IS  - 5
VL  - 27
AB  - Purpose: Recent changes in duty hour allowances and economic constraints are forcing a paradigm shift in graduate medical education in the United States. Internet-based learning is a rapidly growing component of postgraduate medical education, including the field of critical care medicine. Here, we define the key concepts of Internet-based learning, summarize the current literature, and describe how Internet-based learning may be uniquely suited for the critical care provider. Methods: A MEDLINE/ PubMed search from January 2000 to July 2011 using the search terms: "e-learning, "Web-based learning, " "computer-aided instruction,""adult learning, " "knowledge retention", "intensive care," and "critical care". Results: The growth of the Internet is marked by the development of new technologies, including more user-derived tools. Nonmedical fields have embraced Internet-based learning as a valuable teaching tool. A recent meta-analysis described Internet-based learning in the medical field as being more effective than no intervention and likely as efficacious as traditional teaching methods. Web sites containing interactive features are aptly suited for the adult learner, complementing the paradigm shift to more learner-centered education. Interactive cases, simulators, and games may allow for improvement in clinical care. The total time spent utilizing Internetbased resources, as well as the frequency of returning to those sites, may influence educational gains. Conclusion: Internet-based learning may provide an opportunity for assistance in the transformation of medical education. Many features ofWeb-based learning, including interactivity, make it advantageous for the adult medical learner, especially in the field of critical care medicine, and further work is necessary to develop a robust learning platform incorporating a variety of learning modalities for critical care providers. © The Author(s) 2012.

TI  - Internet gambling is a predictive factor of Internet addictive behavior
among Cypriot adolescents
IS  - 4
VL  - 2
AB  - Background and aims: Adolescent Internet gambling is associated with
concomitant addictive behaviors. This study aimed to assess the
prevalence of Internet gambling practices, its impact upon psychosocial
development and to evaluate the association between gambling practices
and Internet addictive behavior among Cypriot adolescents. Methods: A
cross-sectional study was conducted in a convenience sample (n = 805) of
adolescents attending selected public schools (9th and 10th grades) in
Cyprus. Anonymous self-completed questionnaires were used including the
Internet Addiction Test and the Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire. Results: Among the study population (n = 805),
approximately one third (n = 28; 34.9\%) reported Internet gambling.
Internet gamblers were twice as likely to utilize Internet caf portals
(adjusted odds ratio for gender and age, AOR: 2.13; 95\% confidence
interval, 95\% CI: 1.56-2.91) for interactive game-playing (AOR: 6.84;
95\% CI: 4.23-11.07), chat-rooms (AOR: 2.57; 95\% CI: 1.31-4.85), and
retrieval of sexual information (AOR: 1.99; 95\% CI: 1.42-2.81). Among
Internet gamblers 26.0\% (n = 73) reported borderline addictive Internet
use and 4.3\% (n = 12) addictive behavior. Internet gamblers more often
had comprehensive psychosocial and emotional maladjustment (AOR: 4.00;
95\% CI: 1.97-8.13), including Abnormal Conduct Problems (AOR: 3.26;
95\% CI: 2.00-5.32), Emotional Symptoms (AOR: 1.78; 95\% CI: 1.02-3.11),
and Peer Problems (AOR: 2.44; 95\% CI: 1.08-5.48) scores. The
multivariate regression analyses indicated that the single independent
predictor associated with Internet addictive behavior was Internet
gambling (AOR: 5.66; 95\% CI: 1.45-22.15). Discussion: Internet gambling
is associated with addictive Internet use, as well as emotional
maladjustment and behavioral problems, among Cypriot adolescents.
Conclusions: Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate whether
Internet gambling constitutes a risk factor for the development of
Internet addictive behavior among adolescents.

TI  - Internet Gaming Disorder: the interplay between physical activity and user–avatar relationship
IS  - 6
VL  - 37
AB  - Understanding both the risk and protective factors associated with Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) has been viewed by many in the gaming studies field as an area of research priority. The present study focused on the potential risk and protective effects of user–avatar (game figure) relationship and physical activity (PA), respectively. To address these aims, a cross-sectional and a longitudinal mixed-methods design were combined (comprising both psychological and physiological assessments). A sample of 121 emerging adult gamers (18–29 years) residing in Australia, who played massively multiplayer online games, were assessed in relation to their IGD behaviours using the nine-item Internet Gaming Disorder Scale–Short Form. Additionally, the Proto-Self-Presence (PSP) scale was used to evaluate the extent to which gamers identified with the body of their avatar. Finally, a PA monitor (Fitbit Flex) measured levels of energy consumed during real-world daily activities (active minutes). A number of linear regressions and moderation analyses were conducted. Findings confirmed that PSP functioned as an IGD risk factor and that PA acted protectively, weakening the association between PSP and IGD behaviours.

TI  - Investigating quality factors of interactive fitness games based on Kano model
AB  - Purpose: The rise of interactive fitness games in the post-epidemic era has resulted in the need to establish a quality evaluation index system. This study aims to develop such a system and provide a reference for enhancing the quality of interactive fitness games. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this, interviews and questionnaires were conducted to identify the factors that influence the quality of interactive fitness games. The Kano model and SII (Satisfaction Increment Index)-Dissatisfaction Decrement Index (DDI) two-dimensional quadrant analysis were then used to explore differences in quality judgment between males and females, as well as their priorities for improving interactive fitness games. Findings: The study revealed that males and females have different quality judgments for “rich and diverse content,” “motivational value,” “sensitive motion recognition detection” and “portability.” However, both genders share similar views on the other quality factors. In addition, the study identified differences in the priority of improvement between men and women. “Very interesting,” “effective fitness achievement,” “motivating fitness maintenance,” “sensitive motion recognition detection,” “portability” and “educational value” were found to be of higher priority for men than women. Originality/value: These findings provide a valuable theoretical reference for developers and designers of interactive fitness games seeking to enhance the user experience. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - “I” seek differentiation and “we” seek assimilation: the impact of self-expressive customization on consumers’ willingness to pay a premium
IS  - 5
VL  - 30
AB  - Purpose: Customization, as a crucial way to meet the heterogeneous demand of individuals, exists two fundamental and competing motivations, namely, assimilation and uniqueness. Based on optimal distinctiveness theory, this paper aims to validate the interactive effect of self-expressive customization types (i.e. customization to express individual identity and customization to express a shared identity) and self-construal on consumers’ willingness to pay a premium (WPP). Design/methodology/approach: Two studies were conducted to provide empirical support for all proposed hypotheses. The first study (n = 151) uses a hypothetical scenario of a basketball game to test the interaction effect of self-expressive customization and self-construal. The second study (n = 184) assumes a scenario of designing a t-shirt or a uniform to examined the moderated mediating role of consumer-product identification. Findings: The results reveal that independent (vs interdependent) self-construal will have stronger consumer-product identification for customization to express an individual identity (vs customization to express a shared identity), thus generating a higher WPP. Also, perceived task difficulty is the boundary condition of the research model. Research limitations/implications: This paper makes insightful contributions to the customization literature by strengthening the identity signals of customization and exploring the psychological mechanism and the boundary conditions. Originality/value: This research is one of the first few empirical studies to examine the impact of self-expressive customization on consumers’ WPP via the identification with the focal object. This paper not only expands the literature of self-expressive customization but also provides a new research direction for the research of person-object interaction in marketing. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Is Fun For Wellness Engaging? Evaluation of User Experience of an Online Intervention to Promote Well-Being and Physical Activity
VL  - 3
AB  - Online well-being interventions demonstrate great promise in terms of both engagement and outcomes. Fun For Wellness (FFW) is a novel online intervention grounded in self-efficacy theory and intended to improve multidimensional well-being and physical activity through multi-modal methods. These strategies include capability-enhancing opportunities, learning experiences such as games, video vignettes, and self-assessments. RCT studies have suggested that FFW is efficacious in improving subjective and domain-specific well-being, and effective in improving mental health, physical health, physical activity, and self-efficacy in United States. adults who are overweight and in the general population. The present study uses qualitative and quantitative user experience data collected during two RCT trials to understand and evaluate engagement with FFW, its drivers, and its outcomes. Results suggest that FFW is enjoyable, moderately engaging, and easy to use; and contributes to positive outcomes including skill development and enhanced confidence, for both overweight individuals and the general adult population. Drivers of engagement appear to include rewards, gamification, scenario-based learning, visual tracking for self-monitoring, ease of use and simple communications, and the entertaining, interactive nature of program activities. Findings indicate that there are opportunities to streamline and simplify the experience. These results can help improve FFW and contribute to the science of engagement with online interventions designed to improve well-being. © Copyright © 2021 Scarpa, Prilletensky, McMahon, Myers, Prilleltensky, Lee, Pfeiffer, Bateman and Brincks.

TI  - Is the Peer Presence Effect on Heightened Adolescent Risky
Decision-Making only Present in Males?
IS  - 3, SI
VL  - 49
AB  - Social neurodevelopmental imbalance models posit that peer presence
causes heightened adolescent risk-taking particularly during early
adolescence. Evolutionary theory suggests that these effects would be
most pronounced in males. However, the small but growing number of
experimental studies on peer presence effects in adolescent risky
decision-making showed mixed findings, and the vast majority of such
studies did not test for the above-described gender and adolescent phase
moderation effects. Moreover, most of those studies did not assess the
criterion validity of the employed risky decision-making tasks. The
current study was designed to investigate the abovementioned hypotheses
among a sample of 327 ethnically-diverse Dutch early and mid-adolescents
(49.80\% female; M-age = 13.61). No main effect of peer presence on the
employed risky-decision making task (i.e., the stoplight game) was
found. However, the results showed a gender by peer presence moderation
effect. Namely, whereas boys and girls engaged in equal levels of risks
when they completed the stoplight game alone, boys engaged in more
risk-taking than girls when they completed this task together with two
same-sex peers. In contrast, adolescent phase did not moderate peer
presence effects on risk-taking. Finally, the results showed that
performance on the stoplight game predicted self-reported real-world
risky traffic behavior, alcohol use and delinquency. Taken together,
using a validated task, the present findings demonstrate that individual
differences (i.e., gender) can determine whether the social environment
(i.e., peer presence) affect risk-taking in early- and mid-adolescents.
The finding that performance on a laboratory risky decision-making task
can perhaps help identify adolescents that are vulnerable to diverse
types of heightened risk behaviors is an important finding for science
as well as prevention and intervention efforts.

TI  - It's All in the Delivery! An Analysis of Instructional Strategies From Effective Health Education Curricula
IS  - 5
VL  - 81
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study explores the relationship between instructional strategies and effective health education curricula. METHODS: A content analysis of 10 health education curricula was conducted to determine if they include common instructional strategies for actively engaging students in acquisition of health skills. To be included, the curricula had to (1) be research-based and proven via empirical testing to positively influence the health behaviors and (2) address 1 of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 6 priority health risk behaviors. RESULTS: Content analysis revealed 5 active learning strategies incorporated to involve students in acquiring health skills. Role play, group cooperation, and small group discussion were found in all 10 curricula. To a lesser extent, interactive technology and team games were also included. CONCLUSION: When combined with previous research regarding the characteristics of effective teachers, it becomes clear that effective health education is delivered by teachers who employ a wide repertoire of active learning strategies while devoting substantial instructional time to those specific strategies that involve students in skills practice. © 2011, American School Health Association.

TI  - “It's like the snakes and ladders game.”; lived experience of patients with multiple sclerosis regarding their return to work: A qualitative study
IS  - 21
VL  - 42
AB  - Purpose: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) can negatively affect patients' work, education, family, and social and economic activities. Unemployment is a social problem leading to many negative consequences for patients with MS. Therefore, this study aimed to explore lived experiences of MS patients regarding their Return to Work (RTW). Methods: This qualitative study was conducted in Urmia MS Association in Iran. Twelve patients with MS were selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected from July 2019 to March 2020 using semi-structured face-to-face interviews. Data were analyzed using the interpretative phenomenological approach suggested by Dickelman, Allen, and Tanner. Results: Data analysis led to the development of four main themes of "interactive patterns," "supportive system," "challenges," and "stability/volatility." The theme of "interactive patterns" was supported by two sub-themes of " social interaction " and "Social stigma." Four sub-themes of "family support," "workplace support," "MS Association support," and "professional support" formed the theme of "supportive system." The theme of "challenges" was supported by two sub-themes of "individual problems" and "social constraints." The theme of "stability-volatility" was made up of two sub-themes of " adaptative and compatible behaviors " and " non-adaptive and incompatible behaviors." Conclusion: Patients with MS encounter challenges that can have devastating mental, social, and financial health consequences. Meanwhile, healthcare professionals should provide patients with emotional and educational support to help them cope with a changed outlook on life. Employers and policymakers should take practical steps to maintain the employment of these patients for a more extended period to help them better manage their cost of living and treatment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - "It Started as a Joke": On the Design of Idle Games
AB  - With idle games, active withdrawal from the game comprises an essential part of gameplay as players wait for the game state to change over time. This mode of interaction is paradigmatic for the change of roles technologies have in our lives. However, the design elements of idle games are less well understood, particularly from the perspectives of developers. We interviewed six designers of six different popular idle games and inquired into their individual approaches. Via thematic analysis, we refine and expand on existing definitions of idle games as a genre, shed light on ethically charged practices of care in their design, and identify shared core characteristics between the games and processes. We then generate intermediate-level knowledge on the design of idle games. Our work contributes designers' perspectives on idle games and their design to a growing body of literature on the genre.

TI  - Jaguar (<i>Panthera onca</i>) density and tenure in a critical
biological corridor
IS  - 6
VL  - 101
AB  - We estimated jaguar density and tenure, and investigated ranging
behavior, using camera traps across the Maya Forest Corridor, a
human-influenced landscape in central Belize that forms the only
remaining connection for jaguar populations inhabiting two regional
forest blocks: the Selva Maya and the Maya Mountain Massif. Jaguars were
ubiquitous across the study area. Similar to the neighboring Selva Maya,
mean density ranged from 1.5 to 3.1 jaguars per 100 km(2), estimated by
spatial capture-recapture models. Cameras detected almost twice as many
males as females, probably reflecting detection bias, and males ranged
more widely than females within the camera grid. Both sexes crossed two
major rivers, while highway crossings were rare and male-biased, raising
concern that the highway could prevent female movement if traffic
increases. Jaguars were more transient where the landscape was
fragmented with settlements and agriculture than in contiguous forest.
Compared with jaguars in the protected forests of the Maya Mountains,
jaguars in central Belize displayed a lower potential for investment in
intraspecific communication, indicative of a lower quality landscape;
however, we did detect mating behavior and juveniles. Tenure of
individuals was shorter than in the protected forests, with a higher
turnover rate for males than females. At least three-quarters of
reported jaguar deaths caused by people were male jaguars, and the
majority was retaliation for livestock predation. Jaguars seem
relatively tolerant to the human-influenced landscape of central Belize.
However, intensification of game hunting and lethal control of predators
would threaten population persistence, while increased highway traffic
and clear-cutting riparian forest would severely limit the corridor
function. Our results show that the viability of the corridor, and thus
the long-term survival of jaguar populations in this region, will depend
on appropriate land-use planning, nonlethal control of livestock
predators, enforcement of game hunting regulations, and
wildlife-friendly features in future road developments.

TI  - Just Dance: The Effects of Exergame Feedback and Controller Use on
Physical Activity and Psychological Outcomes
IS  - 3
VL  - 4
AB  - Objective: In Asia, dance games are among the most popular types of
exergames. Whereas traditional dance-based games emphasize step
movements on a dance pad, more recent dance games emphasize intuitive
dance movements using simple controllers or players' own bodies to
``just dance.'' However, because of limited space and access, young
adults in Taiwan often do not use these games. Popular dance videos on
YouTube are more readily available to students because these videos can
be accessed on a computer. Therefore, the current study examines the
effects of interactivity (the role of feedback) and controller use on
participants' physiological and psychological outcomes during exergames.
Materials and Methods: The dance game ``Just Dance 3'' (Ubisoft,
Montreuil, France) was chosen as the stimulus for this study.
Participants danced through one song for rehearsal and warm-up, followed
by three songs for the experiment, which lasted approximately 12
minutes. One hundred twenty-nine college students participated in a 2 x
2 x 2 (interactivity, feedback versus no feedback; controller, with
versus without; sex, male versus female) between-subject factorial
design.
Results: A series of 2 x 2 x 2 (interactivity, controller, and sex)
analyses of variance showed no significant differences in interaction
effects on participants' heart rates, blood pressures, body movements,
step counts, or perceived psychological outcomes.
Conclusions: Dance game videos without feedback are also effective tools
for achieving moderate-level exercise intensity. These videos can
supplement the limited access to games in Asian countries, such as
Taiwan.

TI  - Leading presence-based strategies to manipulate user experience in virtual reality environments
IS  - 4
VL  - 26
AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has been widely used to simulate various real-like environments suitable to explore and interact, similar to being genuinely there (i.e., allowing presence). User experience in virtual environments (VE) is highly subjective, and presence-based self-reports have addressed its assessment; however, it is unclear how a diverse set of VR features relates to the subscales of the questionnaires (e.g., engagement, immersion, or Attention), which could be helpful to create and improve immersive VE. Consequently, most current studies have appealed to self-defined criteria to design their VE in response to a lack of accepted methodological frameworks. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the current publications to identify critical design elements to promote presence and realistic experiences in VR-games users. We extracted information from different databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, ACM, IEEE, Springer, and Scholar) and used inclusion and exclusion criteria to reduce the original set of 595 candidates to 53 final papers. The findings showed that better quality and quantity in resources allocation (software and hardware) and more accuracy in objects and characters, which all refer to higher immersion, provide Place Illusion (PI), i.e., the spatial dimension of presence. Furthermore, Scenario’s Realism, external stimuli, and coherent match between virtual and real worlds (including body representation) are decisive to set Plausibility Illusion (PSI), i.e., the dimension associated with coherence. Finally, performance feedback, character customization, and multiplayer mechanics are crucial to assure motivation and agency, which are user-exclusive but crucial to defining presence’s perception. Moreover, about 65% of the analyzed studies agreed that immersive media and social interaction could simultaneously influence PI and PSI. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Learning by feeling: Evoking empathy with synthetic characters
IS  - 3-4
VL  - 19
AB  - Virtual environments (VEs) are now becoming a promising new technology
to be used in the development of interactive learning environments for
children. Perhaps triggered by the success of computer games, VEs are
seen as an emergent and engaging new way by which children can learn
experimental sciences and other disciplines. Inhabiting these IVEs can
be agents or intelligent characters that are responsible for events that
happen in the environment and make it not predictive or completely
controlled. However, to build such environments, in particular, if
populated by synthetic characters, one needs to carefully address the
problem of how do the learners respond to the characters in the virtual
environment. Do learners like the characters? Do learners identify
themselves with characters in virtual environments? This relation
between learners and characters in virtual environments can be studied
in several perspectives. In this paper, we will focus primarily on the
issue of empathy as one desirable aspect of the affective interaction
between learners and synthetic characters. In particular, we will defend
that in order for such affective relations to happen, characters should
be created and designed taking into account what we call the proximity
factor. This is based on the fact that children are found to respond
more empathically to those that are perceived as similar to the self
than those who are perceived as dissimilar (Barnett 1987). This appears
to be the case when similarity is defined in terms of a shared
characteristic, such as sex (Bryant 1982), race or in terms of shared
personal experiences ( Bryant 1982). Thus, designing characters aiming
at pedagogical empathic interactions, we should carefully address how
close the learner will feel with the synthetic characters developed in
terms of situation, behavior or even physical appearance.
In order to illustrate this factor in eliciting emotional reactions to
synthetic characters, we will present a specific system called FearNot!.
FearNot! was developed to address the difficult and often devastating
problem of bullying in schools. By using role-playing and synthetic
characters in a 3D environment, FearNot! allows children from age 8 to
12 to experience a virtual scenario where they can witness ( in a
third-person perspective) bullying situations. To build empathy into
FearNot, we have considered the following components: agent's
architecture, the characters' embodiment, the environment itself, and
emotionally charged situations. All these elements were built to allow
for a stronger proximity with the user and the system. In this paper, we
will focus primarily on this problem and report some results achieved in
the evaluation executed with 127 children and 95 adults on the system.

TI  - Learning Performance of Different Genders’ Computational Thinking
IS  - 24
VL  - 14
AB  - While the role of computational thinking (CT) has been widely reported in technology applications and further integrated into interdisciplinary learning, the integration of pedagogy-supported interdisciplinary activities for the empowerment of girls’ learning must not solely emphasise CT problem-solving skills. Rather, it must scaffold them with interactive learning that supports their characteristics while catering to gender equality. In this study, a gender-balanced interdisciplinary activity, integrating CT with Mandarin learning (ML), was designed for an elementary school in the Mandarin as a Second Language learning context using Social Robots (SRs). It sought to verify the results of the proposed method along with focused activities and interaction in an SR-integrated activity on the CT abilities and target-language learning of young learners. A total of 46 Grade 5 students, 26 boys and 20 girls, participated in the experiment. The study used a quasi-experimental method by examining the result of pre- and post-tests on language acquisition, programming self-efficacy, the educational robot attitude, and learning perceptions in the activity. The results indicated that there were no gender differences in terms of ML, self-efficacy in programming, or attitudes toward using SRs in the SR-integrated interdisciplinary activities. However, the boys and girls had different perceptions of learning. Suggestions for conducting SR-integrated interdisciplinary learning are given, along with pedagogical implications for the further promotion of women in technology. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Learning to communicate computationally with Flip: A bi-modal programming language for game creation
VL  - 80
AB  - Teaching basic computational concepts and skills to school children is currently a curricular focus in many countries. Running parallel to this trend are advances in programming environments and teaching methods which aim to make computer science more accessible, and more motivating. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Flip, a programming language that aims to help 11-15 year olds develop computational skills through creating their own 3D role-playing games. Flip has two main components: 1) a visual language (based on an interlocking blocks design common to many current visual languages), and 2) a dynamically updating natural language version of the script under creation. This programming-language/natural-language pairing is a unique feature of Flip, designed to allow learners to draw upon their familiarity with natural language to "decode the code". Flip aims to support young people in developing an understanding of computational concepts as well as the skills to use and communicate these concepts effectively. This paper investigates the extent to which Flip can be used by young people to create working scripts, and examines improvements in their expression of computational rules and concepts after using the tool. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of Flip before describing an evaluation study carried out with 12-13 year olds in a naturalistic setting. Over the course of 8 weeks, the majority of students were able to use Flip to write small programs to bring about interactive behaviours in the games they created. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in their computational communication after using Flip (as measured by a pre/post-test). An additional finding was that girls wrote more, and more complex, scripts than did boys, and there was a trend for girls to show greater learning gains relative to the boys. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Learning with quizzes, simulations, and adventures: Students' attitudes, perceptions and intentions to learn with different types of serious games
VL  - 88
AB  - Students' attitudes, their perceptions of cognitive and affective quality as predictors of attitudes, and the resulting intention toward learning with serious games remains ambiguous, largely due to the use of imprecise measures. The presented studies have aimed to develop and test a measurement of students' attitudes, perceptions, and intentions to learn with serious games in general, and to use the instrument to examine differences for the most common types of serious games, that is quiz, simulation, and adventure. To this end, a pretest (n = 301) and two main studies (Study 1: n = 135, Study 2: n = 375) were conducted. The developed instrument shows high reliability and convergent validity. Results demonstrate positive attitudes, positive cognitive perceptions, and high positive and low negative affective perceptions of students toward learning with serious games in general, as well as with different game types. Findings from a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), however, indicate differences between the three game types that could be related to the perceptions of cognitive and affective quality. Predominately, compared to quizzes and adventures, simulations were perceived as more supportive for the comprehension and application of knowledge while promoting a less positive affect. Additionally, there was a significant difference due to gender. Whereas females reported higher perceptions of negative affective quality compared to males when serious games were addressed in general, answers to questions about the specific game types revealed a more detailed picture. In contrast to previous findings in existing literature, female students reported a more positive attitude, as well as higher perceptions of positive affective quality, than males for all three game types. These results stress the importance of examining the types of serious games separately and considering gender when evaluating students' attitudes and perceptions when learning with serious games. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Let's play! mobile health games for adults
AB  - Researchers have designed a variety of systems that promote wellness. However, little work has been done to examine how casual mobile games can help adults learn how to live healthfully. To explore this design space, we created OrderUP!, a game in which players learn how to make healthier meal choices. Through our field study, we found that playing OrderUP! helped participants engage in four processes of change identified by a well-established health behavior theory, the Transtheoretical Model: they improved their understanding of how to eat healthfully and engaged in nutrition-related analytical thinking, reevaluated the healthiness of their real life habits, formed helping relationships by discussing nutrition with others and started replacing unhealthy meals with more nutritious foods. Our research shows the promise of using casual mobile games to encourage adults to live healthier lifestyles.

TI  - Leveraging Emotion for Behavior Change: Lessons from Implementation of the “Emo-Demo” Behavior Change Technique in Rural Mozambique
IS  - sup2
VL  - 28
AB  - Innovative social behavior change communication (SBCC) can help improve child nutrition, but little is known about the process of implementing innovative nutrition SBCC strategies in resource-poor settings and associated challenges. This research study examines emotional demonstrations (Emo-Demos), interactive game-like group activities that aim to spark behavior change by pulling emotional levers. It seeks to determine whether they are feasible and acceptable for implementers and targeted community members in rural Mozambique, aiming to draw lessons for the application of similar highly interactive SBCC approaches in resource-poor settings—a key equity issue. This is done through a series of structured observations of the approach being delivered in seven communities as well as interviews with facilitators and participants. Results show the Emo-Demos were generally feasible to implement as planned and largely acceptable for both facilitators and participants. However, facilitators did not always understand the theory behind them, the importance of them being interactive, and the exact steps that needed to be followed to do them correctly. Participants universally reported enjoying the sessions and understood the lessons taught, and were able to translate them into potential behavior changes. However, few reported the expected emotional reaction to the sessions, and some had difficulty understanding the symbolic use of props in the exercises. The results underline the importance of strong training of SBCC facilitators, including on underlying theory; adapting approaches to local realities; and considering the incentives for participants to attend. These steps can help ensure high-quality SBCC that functions even in resource-poor settings, increasing intervention equity. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - LINA - A Social Augmented Reality Game around Mental Health, Supporting Real-world Connection and Sense of Belonging for Early Adolescents
IS  - CHI PLAY
VL  - 6
AB  - Early adolescence is a time of major social change; a strong sense of belonging (SB) and peer connectedness is an essential protective factor in mental health (MH) during that period. In this paper we introduce LINA, an augmented reality (AR) smartphone-based serious game played in school by an entire class (age 10+) together with their teacher, which aims to facilitate and improve peer interaction, SB and class climate, while creating a safe space to reflect on MH and external stressors related to family circumstance. LINA was developed through an interdisciplinary collaboration involving a playwright, software developers, psychologists and artists, via an iterative co-development process with young people. A prototype has been evaluated quantitatively for usability and qualitatively for efficacy in a study with 91 early adolescents (agemean=11.41). Results from the Game User Experience Satisfaction Scale (GUESS-18) and data from qualitative focus groups showed high acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the game. Using AR, a shared immersive narrative and collaborative gameplay in a shared physical space offers an opportunity to harness adolescent affinity for digital technology towards improving real-world social connection and SB.

TI  - Linguistic dual tasking reduces emotionality, vividness and credibility of voice memories in voice-hearing individuals: Results from a controlled trial
VL  - 216
AB  - Dual taxation of the working memory during recall is an effective strategy to reduce the emotionality and vividness of visual intrusive memories and potentially changes dysfunctional beliefs associated with the memories. This study tested the hypothesis that dual tasking decreases emotionality, vividness and credibility of auditory intrusive images (i.e., memories of auditory hallucinations) with a two-level (time: pre and post; condition: dual tasking and recall only) within-subjects design. Thirty-seven voice-hearing participants selected two negative voice-hearing experiences. They recalled one of these experiences while performing a lingual dual task (i.e., language game on smartphone app) and recalled one memory without a dual task (in counterbalanced order). During the pre-test and post-test, emotionality and vividness of the voice-hearing memories were rated, as well as the credibility of the voice statements. There was a significantly greater decrease in emotionality, vividness and credibility during dual tasking than during recall only. This study provides proof of principle that the salience and credibility of the content of auditory hallucinations can be reduced by dual tasking; the clinical implications are also discussed. © 2019

TI  - Linking serious game narratives with pedagogical theories and
pedagogical design strategies
IS  - 3, SI
VL  - 29
AB  - Narrative-based serious games present pedagogical content and
interventions through an interactive narrative. To ensure effective
learning in such kind of serious games, designers are not only faced
with the challenge of creating a compelling narrative, but also with the
additional challenge of incorporating suitable pedagogical strategies.
Therefore, development teams must consist of a multidisciplinary group
including storytellers, technical staff and pedagogical experts to make
sure that suitable pedagogical strategies are incorporated into the
narrative. In this paper, the authors show how the Domain Specific
Modeling Language ATTAC-L, for modeling the narrative of a serious game,
allows creating the link between the processes of pedagogical design and
narrative modeling by means of an elaborate annotation system. As such,
this modeling language enables different experts to concentrate on the
aspects related to their field of expertise without losing oversight of
the serious game as a whole. More in particular, we will show how the
annotation system can be used to document and integrate the use of a
well-grounded pedagogical theory, Social Cognitive Theory, for achieving
the goals of a serious game, as well as when the serious game is part of
a program developed by means of a well-grounded design strategy,
Intervention Mapping Protocol.

TI  - "Little brothers watching you": raising awareness of data leaks on smartphones
AB  - Today's smartphone applications expect users to make decisions about what information they are willing to share, but fail to provide sufficient feedback about which privacy-sensitive information is leaving the phone, as well as how frequently and with which entities it is being shared. Such feedback can improve users' understanding of potential privacy leakages through apps that collect information about them in an unexpected way. Through a qualitative lab study with 19 participants, we first discuss misconceptions that smartphone users currently have with respect to two popular game applications that frequently collect the phone's current location and share it with multiple third parties. To measure the gap between users' understanding and actual privacy leakages, we use two types of interfaces that we developed: just-in-time notifications that appear the moment data is shared and a visualization that summarizes the shared data. We then report on participants' perceived benefits and concerns regarding data sharing with smartphone applications after experiencing notifications and having viewed the visualization. We conclude with a discussion on how heightened awareness of users and usable controls can mitigate some of these concerns.

TI  - Making Mii: studying the effects of methodological approaches and gaming contexts on avatar customization
IS  - 3
VL  - 38
AB  - In this paper we present an analysis of the character creation interface on the Nintendo WiiU and explore the pragmatics of avatar customisation through a between-subjects, qualitative user study involving 24 participants. Our Mii research – or ‘Miisearch’ – is motivated by our desire to highlight the agency these interfaces have in self-representational practices; specifically, to understand the effects of interface affordances on avatar customisation in games. Furthermore, as self-representational practices are often studied using distance methods and self-reporting (e.g. surveys), we compare data on avatar customisation from two sources: a survey and participant observation via micro-ethnography. Results of our study reveal discrepancies between the survey data and participant observation, challenging popular methodological approaches in both the game studies and HCI communities. Most significantly, our findings illustrate the combined effects of gaming contexts and interface affordances on avatar customisation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Manifesto for a European research network into Problematic Usage of the
Internet
IS  - 11
VL  - 28
AB  - The Internet is now all-pervasive across much of the globe. While it has
positive uses (e.g. prompt access to information, rapid news
dissemination), many individuals develop Problematic Use of the Internet
(PUI), an umbrella term incorporating a range of repetitive impairing
behaviours. The Internet can act as a conduit for, and may contribute
to, functionally impairing behaviours including excessive and compulsive
video gaming, compulsive sexual behaviour, buying, gambling, streaming
or social networks use. There is growing public and National health
authority concern about the health and societal costs of PUI across the
lifespan. Gaming Disorder is being considered for inclusion as a mental
disorder in diagnostic classification systems, and was listed in the
ICD-11 version released for consideration by Member States
(http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/revision/timeline/en/). More
research is needed into disorder definitions, validation of clinical
tools, prevalence, clinical parameters, brain-based biology,
socio-health-economic impact, and empirically validated intervention and
policy approaches. Potential cultural differences in the magnitudes and
natures of types and patterns of PUI need to be better understood, to
inform optimal health policy and service development. To this end, the
EU under Horizon 2020 has launched a new four-year European Cooperation
in Science and Technology (COST) Action Programme (CA 16207), bringing
together scientists and clinicians from across the fields of impulsive,
compulsive, and addictive disorders, to advance networked
interdisciplinary research into PUI across Europe and beyond, ultimately
seeking to inform regulatory policies and clinical practice. This paper
describes nine critical and achievable research priorities identified by
the Network, needed in order to advance understanding of PUI, with a
view towards identifying vulnerable individuals for early intervention.
The net-work shall enable collaborative research networks, shared
multinational databases, multicentre studies and joint publications. (c)

TI  - Media use and depression: exposure, household rules, and symptoms among young adolescents in the USA
IS  - 2
VL  - 60
AB  - Objectives: To determine the longitudinal and cross-sectional associations between different types of electronic media use (mobile phones, TV, computers, video games, and music) and young adolescents’ depressive symptoms, and to explore the potential for household media rules to reduce young people’s depression. Methods: 126 young adolescents were recruited from the Northeastern USA. Each type of media use was assessed using survey questions, time use diaries, and ecological momentary assessment. The Beck Depression Index for Primary Care was administered at baseline and 1 year later as part of a questionnaire that also included items assessing the presence of household rules about TV and video games. Results: Baseline use of mobile phones and TV viewing were associated with higher levels of depression 1 year later controlling for demographic information and baseline depression score. Having household rules about TV at baseline predicted lower levels of depression at follow-up. Conclusions: Both TV viewing and mobile phone use may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms. Implementing household rules about the duration and content of TV could help reduce depression in young adolescents. © 2015, Swiss School of Public Health.

TI  - mHealth-Based Gamification Interventions Among Men Who Have Sex With Men
in the HIV Prevention and Care Continuum: Systematic Review and
Meta-Analysis
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: In the past few years, a burgeoning interest has emerged in
applying gamification to promote desired health behaviors. However,
little is known about the effectiveness of such applications in the HIV
prevention and care continuum among men who have sex with men (MSM).
Objective: This study aims to summarize and evaluate research on the
effectiveness of gamification on the HIV prevention and care continuum,
including HIV -testing promotion; condomless anal sex (CAS) reduction;
and uptake of and adherence to pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP),
postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), and antiretroviral therapy (ART).
Methods: We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane
Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Journal of Medical Internet
Research and its sister journals for studies published in English and
Chinese from inception to January 2024. Eligible studies were included
when they used gamified interventions with an active or inactive control
group and assessed at least one of the following outcomes: HIV testing;
CAS; and uptake of and adherence to PrEP, PEP, and ART. During the meta
-analysis, a random -effects model was applied. Two reviewers
independently assessed the quality and risk of bias of each included
study. Results: The systematic review identified 26 studies, including
10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The results indicated that
gamified digital interventions had been applied to various HIV outcomes,
such as HIV testing, CAS, PrEP uptake and adherence, PEP uptake, and ART
adherence. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States
(n=19, 73\%). The most frequently used game component was gaining
points, followed by challenges. The meta -analysis showed gamification
interventions could reduce the number of CAS acts at the 3 -month
follow-up (n=2 RCTs; incidence rate ratio 0.62, 95\% CI 0.44-0.88). The
meta -analysis also suggested an effective but nonstatistically
significant effect of PrEP adherence at the 3 -month follow-up (n=3
RCTs; risk ratio 1.16, 95\% CI 0.96-1.38) and 6 -month follow-up (n=4
RCTs; risk ratio 1.28, 95\% CI 0.89-1.84). Only 1 pilot RCT was designed
to evaluate the effectiveness of a gamified app in promoting HIV testing
and PrEP uptake. No RCT was conducted to evaluate the effect of the
gamified digital intervention on PEP uptake and adherence, and ART
initiation among MSM. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the short-term
effect of gamified digital interventions on lowering the number of CAS
acts in MSM. Further well -powered studies are still needed to evaluate
the effect of the gamified digital intervention on HIV testing, PrEP
uptake, PEP initiation and adherence, and ART initiation in MSM.

TI  - mHealth Technology as a Persuasive Tool for Treatment, Care and Management of Persons Living with HIV
VL  - 19
AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) technology can be a valuable tool in the management of chronic illnesses, including HIV. Qualitative research methods were used to identify the desired content and features of a mobile app for meeting and improving the healthcare needs of persons living with HIV (PLWH). We conducted six focus group sessions with 50 English-or Spanish-speaking PLWH in New York City. To inform data analysis and to illustrate how mHealth technology can be used as a persuasive strategy for improving the health of PLWH, we integrated Fogg’s functional role triad for computing technology model with the self-determination theory to illustrate how mHealth technology can be used as a persuasive strategy for improving the health of PLWH. Participants suggested several tools for meeting their healthcare needs, including: reminders/alerts, lab results tracking, and notes on health status. mHealth technology can function as a social actor by providing chat boxes/forums, testimonials of lived experiences, and personal outreach. Examples of media that can be used as a persuasive technology include games/virtual rewards, coding of health tasks, and simulations on how to connect with PLWH. Findings from these focus groups can be used to design a mobile app for PLWH that is targeted to meet their healthcare needs. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - mHealth video gaming for human papillomavirus vaccination among college men - qualitative inquiry for development
VL  - 8
AB  - Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. Persistent infection with HPV can cause various cancers; however, HPV vaccination can prevent infections associated with high risk, cancerous strains of the virus. As it relates to HPV, college age men have been identified as one of the catch-up vaccination groups. Among college age men, gaming is an extremely popular extracurricular activity. Further, video games have emerged as a popular public health intervention tool. Therefore, this study aims to collect qualitative data on how to develop, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a gaming intervention to increase HPV risk perceptions, improve self-efficacy and increase intention to receive the HPV vaccine among male college students (18-26 years old). Methods: Four focus group sessions ranging from eight to ten individuals were conducted among male college students from one large research-intensive university in the South. Using grounded theory, data from focus group interviews were coded using NVivo software to identify emergent themes. Results: Participants emphasized that although customization was not viewed as important by college aged males, the ability to tailor in game experiences or experience different things each time they played (creative freedom) was more important. They encouraged that the digital game be created on a mobile platform, incorporate health messages, and be informative to reach their population. Furthermore, they suggested innovative way to disseminate the game, which included having health department/health care providers prescribe the game to patients as an end of clinical interaction strategy. Conclusions: College age men, are natural avid gamers, enjoy game play, and can engage in learning online or offline. While platform preference varies among gamer type, college age men in our study emphasized that mobile based gaming is the most advantageous way to increase knowledge/awareness and encourage positive in game behavior which can impact out of game behaviors such as vaccination. Because of the level of access and natural disposition of mHealth technology seen as an "extension of the self", games for health developers should consider the mobile platform as the ideal for the target demographic. © mHealth.

TI  - Microwave Plasma System for Continuous Treatment of Railway Track
IS  - 4
VL  - 8
AB  - Braking conditions are a fundamental issue for the railway and have been a limiting factor in network capacity and timetabling. Leaf fall, especially during the autumn season, creates low-adhesion problems on railways, causing braking problems for trains. To address the requirements of the novel plasma industrial applications towards environmental applications, this work developed and tested a 2.45 GHz microwave atmospheric pressure plasma system for in situ removal of the third body layer deposited onto the railway so as to improve braking. The plasma reactor consisted of a 15 kW, 2.45 GHz magnetron-based microwave generator and a plasma reactor (dielectric tube placed in a TE01 monomode microwave cavity); the atmospheric plasma ignited and sustained at different power levels (2–15 kW) in different gases (nitrogen, argon) as well as mixtures of these gases with reactive molecules (water, oxygen) was jetted directly onto the railhead as to change the conditions for the wheel–rail interface. This technology is hoped to be a game-changer in enabling predictable and optimized braking on the railway network. Challenges encountered during the demonstration phase are discussed. Subsequent work should validate the results on a working railway line during the autumn season. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Might virtual reality promote the mood benefits of exercise?
IS  - 4
VL  - 19
AB  - This study sought to investigate if virtual reality technology enhances
the psychological benefits of aerobic exercise in a laboratory setting.
In this study, 88 university faculty and staff (44 females, 44 males)
were randomly assigned to one of three 30-min conditions including: (1)
bicycling at a moderate intensity (60-70\% maximum heart rate) on a
stationary bicycle, (2) playing a virtual reality computer bicycle game,
or (3) an interactive virtual reality bicycle experience on a computer
while exercising on a stationary bike at moderate intensity (60-70\%
maximum heart rate). The Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List
(AD-ACL) was administered immediately before and after the laboratory
session. Results suggest that virtual reality enhances some of the mood
benefits when paired with exercise. Virtual reality when paired with
exercise enhances enjoyment, energy, and reduces tiredness. Virtual
reality without exercise was discovered to increase participants'
tension, tiredness, and lower their energy level. Results suggest that
the combination of virtual reality and exercise might improve some of
the beneficial psychological effects of exercise compared with virtual
reality or exercise alone. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

TI  - Mobile exergames for preventing diseases related to childhood obesity
AB  - Childhood obesity and physical inactivity are well-known problems which are typically related with videogames. The goal of this study is to develop digital games which motivate children and adolescents to exercise more, instead. The games are realized in such way that no special game consoles are required. The games can be played with a regular computer while mobile phones and heart rate monitors are used as the game controllers. Thus the games can also be played from a public screen in schools, for example, thus offering new exercising possibilities among youngsters. In this study, two exercising games (exergames) are presented and their ability to motivate youngsters is examined by group studies. The results indicate that the developed exergames are suitable in school environment. It is concluded that the games were found engaging and they motivated players to exercise. This indicates a positive effect of exergames in prevention of diseases which are related to childhood obesity and physical inactivity.

TI  - Mobile phone use patterns and preferences in safety net office-based Buprenorphine patients
IS  - 3
VL  - 9
AB  - Background: Integrating mobile phone technologies in addiction treatment is of increasing importance and may optimize patient engagement with their care and enhance the delivery of existing treatment strategies. Few studies have evaluated mobile phone and text message (TM) use patterns in persons enrolled in addiction treatment, and none have assessed the use in safety net, office-based buprenorphine practices. Methods: A 28-item, quantitative and qualitative semistructured survey was administered to opiate-dependent adults in an urban, publicly funded, office-based buprenorphine program. Survey domains included demographic characteristics, mobile phone and TMuse patterns, and preferences pertaining to their recovery. Results: Surveyors approached 73 of the 155 eligible subjects (47%); 71 respondents completed the survey. Nearly all participants reported mobile phone ownership (93%) andTMuse (93%), and most reported "very much" or "somewhat" comfort sending TM (79%). Text message contact with 12-step group sponsors, friends, family members, and counselors was also described (32%). Nearly all preferred having their providers' mobile phone number (94%), and alerting the clinic via TM in the event of a potential relapse to receive both supportive TM and a phone call from their buprenorphine provider was also well received (62%). Conclusions: Mobile phone and TM use patterns and preferences among this sample of office-based buprenorphine participants highlight the potential of adopting patient-centered mobile phone-basedinterventions in this treatment setting.

TI  - Mobile sensor-based community gaming for improving vocational students’ sleep and academic outcomes
VL  - 151
AB  - Quality sleep is critical for teenagers' physical and mental health and, consequently, learning achievement. Technology, particularly the use of mobile sensors and digital game-based learning, has the potential to enhance students' sleep hygiene, reducing insomnia and daytime sleepiness and improving students’ academic performance. Therefore, this study implemented and evaluated a sleep hygiene instruction intervention in terms of three elements: a) mobile sleep sensor data feedback for sleep self-evaluation; b) a collaborative-competitive mobile community game (MCG) for sleep promotion based on social-interdependence; and c) an instructional intervention adopting a social cognitive approach. To validate the efficacy of the instructional design, a pretest-posttest quasi-experiment was conducted with 114 10th grade students from three classes of an urban vocational high school in Taiwan. The three intact classes were randomly assigned to one of three sleep hygiene courses: a comparison group (37 students receiving sleep sensor feedback), experimental group one (E1; 38 students receiving sleep sensor feedback and adopting MCG), and experimental group two (E2; 39 students receiving sleep sensor feedback, adopting MCG, and taking a social cognitive-based course). The empirical results suggest that the use of sleep sensor feedback and the MCG (E1 and E2) effectively improved the sleep behaviors of vocational students. In fact, inclusion of the mobile sensor with feedback on sleep quality was sufficient to provide improvement in both sleep and academic outcomes for all students. These results demonstrate the promising potential of mobile community-based technological interventions for improving sleep hygiene, relieving insomnia daytime sleepiness, when integrated with either traditional or social cognitive-based sleep courses. Specific implications and recommendations for the development of technology-enhanced sleep-related or health promotion courses are provided. © 2020

TI  - Mobile technology, just-in-time learning and gamification: Innovative strategies for a CAUTI education program
IS  - 2
VL  - 22
AB  - Mobile technology deployment at the point of care (POC) is rapidly being embraced in healthcare as a means to address hospital-acquired infections and improve patient outcomes. Implementing technology-driven tools and best practices can be a challenge due to limited accessibility to clinically relevant resources, and reduced workforce engagement. To address this issue, an evidence-based practice change project was implemented in a community hospital located in New Jersey. The aims of this project were twofold: 1) increase nurses' knowledge with respect to best practices for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI); and 2) enhance frontline staff engagement in best practices using a technologydriven platform infused with game-based learning. The project followed a multi-modal, time-series interventional design in which mobile tools were incorporated at the POC to provide targeted CAUTI education, and best practice strategies for registered nurses (n = 37) working in the intensive care and medical/surgical units. Presentations, videos, quizzes, case studies, and discussion boards were uploaded weekly onto a mobile technology platform (MTP) for eight weeks. This socio-technical frontline strategy allowed for just-in-time training (JIT) that promoted action-oriented learning. To incentivize ongoing user engagement, nurses accrued gamification reward points for completing structured online learning activities. Results demonstrated an 18.2% increase in sustained nursing knowledge retention scores (p = .02). In addition, staff rated technology uptake as very favorable at 87%-100%. Findings revealed the project increased nurses' knowledge of CAUTI best practices guidelines, promoted active staff engagement, encouraged technology use, and supported a positive change in POC practices overall. © 2018 Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS).

TI  - Mood contagion of robot body language in human robot interaction
IS  - 6
VL  - 29
AB  - The aim of our work is to design bodily mood expressions of humanoid robots for interactive settings that can be recognized by users and have (positive) effects on people who interact with the robots. To this end, we develop a parameterized behavior model for humanoid robots to express mood through body language. Different settings of the parameters, which control the spatial extent and motion dynamics of a behavior, result in different behavior appearances expressing different moods. In this study, we applied the behavior model to the gestures of the imitation game performed by the NAO robot to display either a positive or a negative mood. We address the question whether robot mood displayed simultaneously with the execution of functional behaviors in a task can (a) be recognized by participants and (b) produce contagion effects. Mood contagion is an automatic mechanism that induces a congruent mood state by means of the observation of another person’s emotional expression. In addition, we varied task difficulty to investigate how the task load mediates the effects. Our results show that participants are able to differentiate between positive and negative robot mood and they are able to recognize the behavioral cues (the parameters) we manipulated. Moreover, self-reported mood matches the mood expressed by the robot in the easy task condition. Additional evidence for mood contagion is provided by the fact that we were able to replicate an expected effect of negative mood on task performance: in the negative mood condition participants performed better on difficult tasks than in the positive mood condition, even though participants’ self-reported mood did not match that of the robot. © 2015, The Author(s).

TI  - Moose harvesting strategies in the presence of wolves
IS  - 2
VL  - 42
AB  - 1. Large carnivores are currently recolonizing areas where they have
been extinct for decades. This poses considerable challenges for
wildlife managers, partly because the optimal harvesting strategies of
prey populations may be affected. If the carnivores in such areas are
under strict management control (as in Scandinavia), the predator will
not show a numerical response to changes in prey density. Consequently,
the density of prey is mainly determined by the vital rates of the prey
population and the predation pressure. In this study we modelled the
optimal harvesting strategy for a prey population in which there was no
numerical response by the predator.
2. Our model is an age-structured deterministic matrix model system.
Optimal harvesting strategies are determined, measuring yield either as
number of animals harvested or as mass of meat.
3. First, using a moose population in Hedmark in south-eastern Norway as
a case study, we demonstrate that continuing to harvest at the rates
used prior to wolf recolonization will lead to a decline in the moose
population.
4. Secondly, harvesting quotas are specified by age and sex, usually
with a high proportion of calves. Although wolves mainly kill juvenile
moose (calves and yearlings), the relationship between harvest
composition and yield is not affected by predation. Both in the presence
and absence of predation, a high proportion of calves in the harvest
gives the highest yield measured as the number of animals harvested,
whereas a high proportion of adults maximizes the yield measured in
terms of meat. Furthermore, a female-biased sex structure in the
population gives a higher yield in both the presence and absence of the
predator.
5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that managers facing the
new challenges presented by recolonizing populations of large predators
such as wolves should reduce the size of harvest quotas in order to
avoid decreases in prey populations. However, the general relationship
between the harvesting strategy and yield maximization is not affected
by wolf predation. The harvest yield from cervid populations is often
important to local economies, and moose is the single most important
game species in Scandinavia. It is therefore important to implement
optimal harvesting strategies under these new conditions in order to
prevent an unnecessary loss of yield, and success in this task may in
turn affect local attitudes towards large carnivores.

TI  - Moving Beyond Fun: Evaluating Serious Experience in Digital Games
AB  - Games are normally considered to be "fun", though recently there is growing interest in how gameplay can promote empathy and encourage reflection through "serious experience". However, when looking beyond enjoyment, it is not clear how to actually evaluate serious experience. We present an evaluation of four games that were submitted to a student game design competition; the competition challenged teams to design a game that inspired curiosity around human error and blame culture within the context of healthcare. The entries were judged by a panel of six experts and subjected to a round of play testing by twelve participants. Methods included gameplay observation, questionnaires, post-play interviews and follow-up email questions. We discuss the utility of these methods, with particular emphasis on how they enabled a consideration of the immediate and longer term impact of serious experience on players.

TI  - Multimodal Corpus Design for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition in Vehicle Cabin
VL  - 9
AB  - This paper introduces a new methodology aimed at comfort for the driver in-the-wild multimodal corpus creation for audio-visual speech recognition in driver monitoring systems. The presented methodology is universal and can be used for corpus recording for different languages. We present an analysis of speech recognition systems and voice interfaces for driver monitoring systems based on the analysis of both audio and video data. Multimodal speech recognition allows using audio data when video data are useless (e.g. at nighttime), as well as applying video data in acoustically noisy conditions (e.g., at highways). Our methodology identifies the main steps and requirements for multimodal corpus designing, including the development of a new framework for audio-visual corpus creation. We identify the main research questions related to the speech corpus creation task and discuss them in detail in this paper. We also consider some main cases of usage that require speech recognition in a vehicle cabin for interaction with a driver monitoring system. We also consider other important use cases when the system detects dangerous states of driver's drowsiness and starts a question-answer game to prevent dangerous situations. At the end based on the proposed methodology, we developed a mobile application that allows us to record a corpus for the Russian language. We created RUSAVIC corpus using the developed mobile application that at the moment a unique audiovisual corpus for the Russian language that is recorded in-the-wild condition.  © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Multiple Concussions Increase Odds and Rate of Lower Extremity Injury in National Collegiate Athletic Association Athletes After Return to Play
IS  - 13
VL  - 47
AB  - Background: Concussion in collegiate athletics is one of the most prevalent sport-related injuries in the United States, with recent studies suggesting persistent deficits in neuromuscular control after a concussion and an associated increase in risk of lower extremity injury. Purpose: To expand on the relationship between concussion and lower extremity injury by examining the effect of multiple concussions (MC) on rate and odds of future lower extremity injury in collegiate athletes after return to play (RTP) compared with matched controls. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: From 2001 to 2016, 48 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletes sustaining multiple concussions at a single institution were identified. Athletes with multiple concussions (MC) were matched directly to athletes with a single concussion (SC) and to athletes with no concussion history (NC) by sex, sport, position, and games played. Incidence of, time to, and location of lower extremity injury were recorded for each group after RTP from their first reported concussion until completion of their collegiate career. Logistic regression was used to analyze odds ratios (ORs) for sustaining lower extremity injury, whereas time to injury was summarized by use of Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank test analysis. Results: The incidence of lower extremity injury after RTP was significantly greater (P =.049) in the MC cohort (36/48, 75%) than in SC athletes (25/48 = 52%) and NC athletes (27/48 = 56%). Similarly, odds of lower extremity injury were significantly greater in the MC cohort than in SC athletes (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.26-7.12; P =.01) and NC athletes (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.07-2.56; P =.02). Time to lower extremity injury was significantly shorter in the MC group compared with matched controls (P =.01). No difference was found in odds of lower extremity injury or time to lower extremity injury between SC and NC athletes. Conclusion: Collegiate athletes with MC were more likely to sustain a lower extremity injury after RTP in a shorter time frame than were the matched SC and NC athletes. This may suggest the presence of a cohort more susceptible to neuromuscular deficits after concussion or more injury prone due to player behavior, and it may imply the need for more stringent RTP protocols for athletes experiencing MC. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - MyLARC: A Theory-Based Interactive Smartphone App to Support
Adolescents' Use of Long-Acting Reversible Contraception
IS  - 3
VL  - 31
AB  - Study Objective: Develop and test the feasibility of a Health Belief
Model theory-based interactive smartphone application (app) aimed at
providing information and support to adolescents with long-acting
reversible contraception (LARC).
Design, Setting, Participants, and Interventions: Using a mixed-method
design, we conducted 30 in-person interviews with adolescent LARC users
who were enrolled in school-based health centers in New York City.
Interviews were conducted in 2 phases: during phase 1, 12 participants
viewed a pilot version of the app (MyLARC); during phase 2, 18
additional participants interacted with an expanded version of the app.
Phase 2 participants downloaded MyLARC onto their smartphone and app
usage was tracked.
Main Outcome Measures: Participants' responses to the in-person
interviews and data usage of MyLARC from phase 2 determined the
feasibility and acceptability of using MyLARC to support young women's
satisfaction and continuation of LARC methods.
Results: Noneducational games were recommended as an approach to provide
information to adolescents in an engaging way, as well as educational
graphics and visually appealing content. Data tracking of MyLARC usage
among phase 2 participants revealed a total of 67 unique logins to the
app with 18 average page visits per unique login. The total amount of
times MyLARC was opened was 1197. The most frequented features were
`Info about LARC' (95 unique visits) and `Games' (80 unique plays).
Conclusion: A theory-based interactive smartphone app with LARC-specific
information and support is an appropriate and appealing medium to
provide information and support to adolescents using LARC. Games
represented a novel opportunity to engage adolescents with health
information.

TI  - Neandertal mobility and large-game hunting: The exploitation of reindeer during the Quina Mousterian at Chez-Pinaud Jonzac (Charente-Maritime, France)
IS  - 4
VL  - 63
AB  - Neandertals were effective hunters of large ungulates throughout their geographic and temporal ranges. Equipped with this knowledge, researchers in paleoanthropology continue to seek insight on the relationships between hunting and subsistence strategies with other components of the Neandertals' niche, such as mobility, site use, and lithic technology. The Quina Mousterian deposits from the rockshelter site of Chez Pinaud Jonzac (Charente-Maritime, France; hereafter Jonzac) offer an excellent opportunity to pursue these issues. This paper focuses on the extensive and well-preserved skeletal remains of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) recovered from recent excavations of the site, representing at least 18 individuals that were hunted by Neandertals during the fall through winter. Our zooarchaeological results indicate that all ages of reindeer were hunted but adult individuals predominate. No bias is evident in the comparable frequencies of males and females. These prey were butchered on-site, with abundant evidence of meat filleting and marrow exploitation. In the excavated sample, the absence of hearths and the almost complete lack of burned bones or stones suggest that Neandertals were not using fire to assist with processing the reindeer carcasses. The zooarchaeological results presented here indicate that reindeer were hunted during a restricted window of time when they were seasonally abundant in the local area near Jonzac. Taken together with the lithic industry based on bifacial elements, the evidence is consistent with a pattern of site use by highly mobile hunter-gatherers making frequent, short-term visits. Ongoing research at Jonzac and other Quina Mousterian localities will contribute to a better understanding of Neandertal behavior during cold climate phases. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Network of mental activities, cognitive function and depression in older
men and women
VL  - 162
AB  - Background: Evidence suggests that lifestyle activities impact cognitive
and mental health in older populations. However, how lifestyle factors
are associated with one another, and which factors are most important
for cognitive function and mental health has received comparatively
little attention.Design: Bayesian-Gaussian network analysis was used to
investigate unique associations between mental activ-ities (MA; i.e.,
activities involving cognitive engagement), global cognition, and
depression at three time-points in a large sample of older adults
(baseline, 2 years, and 4 years follow-up).Setting: This study used
longitudinal data from participants living in Australia and
participating in the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study. Participants: The
sample included 998 participants (55\% female) aged between 70 and 90,
without a diagnosis of dementia at baseline.Measurements:
Neuropsychological assessment of global cognition, self-reported
depressive symptoms, and self -reported information about daily MA.
Results: Cognitive functioning was positively associated with playing
tabletop games and using the internet in both sexes at all time-points.
MA were differentially linked in men and women. Depression was not
consistently associated with MA in men across the three time-points;
women who visited artistic events consistently had lower depression
scores.Conclusions: Engaging with tabletop games and using the internet
was associated with better cognition in both sexes, however sex acted as
a modifier for other associations. These findings are useful for future
investigations that consider interactive associations between MA,
cognition, and mental health in older adults, and their possible roles
in promoting healthy aging.

TI  - Not Just for Girls: Encouraging Cross-Gender Role Play and Reducing Gender Stereotypes with a Strategy Game
AB  - Harsher socio-cultural sanctions against cross-gender role play amongst boys versus girls create comparatively greater pressure for boys to adhere to traditional gender roles [29]. At the same time, strategically orchestrated play experiences may offer a potential means of counteracting this pressure. In the present research, a pair of randomized experiments, involving a strategy game that puts players in the role of princesses, revealed a positive impact of delaying the timing of the revelation of the characters' gender (Study 1) and reducing the degree of femininity of the illustrated representation of the characters (Study 2) on boys' evaluations of the game, level of experience-taking (identification and role assumption) with the princess characters, and shift in both gender perceptions and self-perceptions. Together, these findings illustrate that strategic design choices can facilitate boys' adoption of cross-gender personae and open the door to malleability in adherence to rigid gender roles and norms.

TI  - Not Seen, Not Heard in the Digital World! Measuring Privacy Practices in Children’s Apps
AB  - The digital age has brought a world of opportunity to children. Connectivity can be a game-changer for some of the world’s most marginalized children. However, while legislatures around the world have enacted regulations to protect children’s online privacy, and app stores have instituted various protections, privacy in mobile apps remains a growing concern for parents and wider society. In this paper, we explore the potential privacy issues and threats that exist in these apps. We investigate 20195&nbsp;mobile apps from the Google Play store that are designed particularly for children (Family apps) or include children in their target user groups (Normal apps). Using both static and dynamic analysis, we find that 4.47%&nbsp;of Family apps request location permissions, even though collecting location information from children is forbidden by the Play store, and 81.25%&nbsp;of Family apps use trackers (which are not allowed in children’s apps). Even major developers with 40+ kids apps on the Play store use ad trackers. Furthermore, we find that most permission request notifications are not well designed for children, and 19.25%&nbsp;apps have inconsistent content age ratings across the different protection authorities. Our findings suggest that, despite significant attention to children’s privacy, a large gap between regulatory provisions, app store policies, and actual development practices exist. Our research sheds light for government policymakers, app stores, and developers.

TI  - Occurrence and prevalence of selected zoonotic agents: Echinococcus multilocularis, Trichinella spiralis and hepatitis E virus (HEV) in the population of Polish hunters--results of the study conducted in 2010-2012
IS  - 4
VL  - 69
AB  - UNLABELLED: In Poland the development of the knowledge concerning zoonotic pathogens, of which free-living animals are the reservoir of is gaining in importance both in epidemiological aspect as well as in the context of prevention for improving public health. Dietary habits such as the consumption of forest undergrowth products and wild game meat, and the way of those products being prepared (in the process of barbequing) pose a risk factors of infection with the foodborne pathogens such as Echinococcus multilocularis, Trichinella spp., and HEV.; AIM: The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of infections caused by Trichinella spp., Echinococcus multilocularis, and HEV in the population of Polish hunters, describing their geographical distribution in Poland, and to try to define basic factors, which may contribute to their occurrence.; MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 2010-2012 a cross-sectional study was carried out among Polish hunters. A blood samples were collected as well as a survey of 1027 participants recruited in the 16 provinces was also carried out. Serological tests were performed for the presence of specific antibodies against Echinococcus multilocularis, Trichinella spp. and HEV using commercial or "in home" ELISA tests. In case of positive result for Echinococcus, an Em2plus ELISA or/and western blot test were carried out, and for positive results for IgM for HEV a recomLine HEV IgM test was carried out.; RESULTS: In the studied population a total number of 2 cases of Echinococcus multilocularis infection were found. Moreover in 47 (4,6%) participants presence of antibodies against Trichinella spp. were found, including 17 positive and 30 borderline results. In 206 persons (25%) IgG anti-HEV antibodies were found (by ELISA test). Geographical diversity in prevalence of both, the Trichinella spp. and HEV cases was observed.; SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed presence of zoonotic infections such as Echinococcus multilocularis, Trichinella spp., and hepatitis E (HEV) among Polish hunters. In the case of Echinococcus multilocularis, and Trichinella spp., it appears that these infections are more common in the studied sample than in the general population. Additionally results on the prevalence of HEV infections indicate a need for further research on the occurrence of the virus in the country.

TI  - Open pilot trial of an interactive digital application for campus sexual violence prevention
IS  - 5
VL  - 51
AB  - Digital applications, or “serious games” for health address learning goals in a cognitively active, interactive manner, with the potential for widespread dissemination. This study used a mixed methods approach to develop and conduct a formative evaluation of a digital application for sexual assault prevention. Make a change is a digital application that uses the principles of games for health to foster learning, engagement, and skill-building around risk and protective factors for sexual victimization, sexual aggression, and bystander intervention. The digital application includes four narrative chapters, six embedded activities, as well as a user-derived change plan in which individuals establish goals for behavior change following program completion. This multisite study at a 2- and a 4-year college utilized student interviews (n = 14), stakeholder interviews (n = 10), and focus groups with students (n = 40) to inform intervention development. A total of 41 college students then participated in an open trial and completed self-report surveys (pre, post, and 1-month follow-up) to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, utility, and preliminary outcomes. Most of the sample reported enjoyment, usefulness, and perceived competence after completing the application. Data evidenced a trend to reduce the frequency of heavy drinking, and perceptions of social norms evidenced change over time. Findings support the feasibility and effectiveness of this novel format for the delivery of sexual assault prevention programming. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

TI  - Opportunities for Mobile App-Based Adherence Support for Children With
Tuberculosis in South Africa
IS  - 11
VL  - 8
AB  - Tuberculosis is the number one infectious cause of death globally. Young
children, generally those younger than 5 years, are at the highest risk
of progressing from tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease and
of developing the most severe forms of tuberculosis. Most current
tuberculosis drug formulations have poor acceptability among children
and require consistent adherence for prolonged periods of time. These
challenges complicate children's adherence to treatment and caregivers'
daily administration of the drugs. Rapid developments in mobile
technologies and apps present opportunities for using widely available
technology to support national tuberculosis programs and patient
treatment adherence. Pilot studies have demonstrated that mobile apps
are a feasible and acceptable means of enhancing children's treatment
adherence for other chronic conditions. Despite this, no mobile apps
that aim to promote adherence to tuberculosis treatment have been
developed for children. In this paper, we draw on our experiences
carrying out research in clinical pediatric tuberculosis studies in
South Africa. We present hypothetical scenarios of children's adherence
to tuberculosis medication to suggest priorities for behavioral and
educational strategies that a mobile app could incorporate to address
some of the adherence support gaps faced by children diagnosed with
tuberculosis. We argue that a mobile app has the potential to lessen
some of the negative experiences that children associate with taking
tuberculosis treatment and to facilitate a more positive treatment
adherence experience for children and their caregivers.

TI  - Optimizing the performance of GNU-chess with a genetic algorithm
AB  - We apply an artificial intelligence method based upon a distributed simple genetic algorithm which optimizes by "learning from a mentor" to enhance the performance of the open-source, free gnu-chess program. The genetic algorithm manipulates and optimizes the collection of numerical constants within the gnu-chess program which are used to assign values to chess pieces and their positions. These are built into the code of the evaluation-function for game positions. The above collection of numerical constants within the gnu-chess program constitutes, in principle, the genotype of creatures (candidate solutions) while the compiled program using these constants constitutes the phenotype underlying the genetic algorithm used in our approach. In every generation of the genetic algorithm, the so-generated phenotypes in the current population play a fixed number of games against the original gnu-chess program in order to determine their so-defined fitness-value. After up to 17,000 hours of distributed computation-time for a single optimization on a network of 17 linux workstations, the genetic algorithm finds a chess program that shows a moderate performance improvement compared with the original gnu-chess program. What appears to be new in the approach presented here are:(a) a brute-force optimization using a mentor rather than a co-evolutionary approach is actually carried out with contemporary PC hardware, and(b) optimizations for playing white and black are carried out separately which seemingly has not been attempted by other means before.

TI  - Parental intention to support video game play by children with autism spectrum disorder: An application of the theory of planned behavior
IS  - 2
VL  - 46
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine parental attitudes regarding engagement with video games by their children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and whether attitudes vary based on ASD symptom severity. Method: Online survey methodology was used to gather information from parents of children with ASD between the ages of 8 and 12 years. The finalized data set included 152 cases. Descriptive statistics and frequency analyses were used to examine participant demographics and video game play. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to evaluate questions on the theory of planned behavior. Regression analyses determined the predictive ability of the theory of planned behavior constructs, and t tests provided additional descriptive information about between-group differences. Results: Children with ASD play video games. There are no significant differences in the time, intensity, or types of games played based on severity of ASD symptoms (mild vs. moderate). Parents of children with ASD had positive attitudes about video game play. Conclusions: Parents of children with ASD appear to support video game play. On average, parents indicated video game play was positive for their children with ASD, particularly if they believed the games were having a positive impact on their child’s development. © 2015 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

TI  - Paying to play: an economic experiment examining children’s avatar preferences and their willingness to pay for them
IS  - 3
VL  - 20
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is a formal experimental economics test of results found in a study designed and executed by a 12-year-old who was concerned about what she perceived to be bias in gaming applications (apps) that provided male avatar characters for no cost but required in-app purchases to access female characters. The present study was designed to test empirically whether children have a revealed preference for same-gendered characters and whether such preferences are dependent on the cost of the characters. Design/methodology/approach: Children from 6 to 16 years of age were recruited to participate in a framed field economics experiment in which they would earn actual money and be given opportunities to spend it on in-game avatars they could then use to continue to play. Additionally, a survey gathered data on participants’ stated preferences and experiences playing game apps on mobile phones. Findings: Children do prefer to play a character of the same gender; however, they are more likely to remain the default character if choosing a different character costs money. When asked to say why they picked their character, children report most often that it is based on either the characters’ appearance or gender, followed by perceived character abilities, liking the character and the cost of a character. A vast majority (90 per cent) of children felt both male and female characters should be free. Research limitations/implications: This research was limited because the experiment simulated in-app purchases but could not offer the permanence of real-world in-app purchases. Players in the experiment could not “keep” the character if they chose to pay for it. The authors adjusted for this by making the cost to change character gender much lower than it would be in the game (25 cents in the study vs approximately $10 in the app). Future research could explore ways to make in-app purchases during the study permanent for players to test if the permanence of the purchase results in greater willingness to pay to switch character gender. Practical implications: This research has practical implications for video game designers. As both male and female players prefer to play with characters of the same gender, and having a cost to play a character reduces switching behavior, it is possible that having a cost for female characters reduces the popularity of the game with female players. This is especially relevant for endless running games as these games are preferred more by women than men. By making female characters free, default character and developers may increase the popularity of these games with female players. Originality/value: This study adds to the body of literature about gender and video game preferences because prior studies relied solely on stated preferences about characters (using surveys and self-reported behaviors) and not on revealed preferences (observed behaviors). Additionally, this study examines character gender preferences in a casual game, while most prior studies have examine preferences in massively multiplayer online role-playing games. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Personality Traits and Psychiatric Comorbidities in Individuals with
Internet Use Disorder - A Cross-sectional Study
IS  - 1
VL  - 29
AB  - Aim: The aim is to evaluate the association of personality traits,
online activities, and psychiatric comorbidities with the Internet use
disorder. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 481
professional college students (18-25 years) pursuing graduation.
Participants responded to an online questionnaire consisting of Young's
Internet addiction test, Internet Gaming Disorder scale-short form, Big
Five inventory and behavioral inhibition system/behavioral activation
system scales (BIS/BAS) scales, and subsequent in-clinic evaluation
using MINI 7.0.2 questionnaire. Results: Of 481 college students, 175
(36.38\%) had Internet use disorder. Of these, 115 were found to have
mild, 57 moderate, and 3 severe Internet use disorders with a mean age
of 20.85 +/- 1.84 years and sex ratio of M:F: 0.9:1. The prevalence of
Internet gaming disorder was found to be 0.42\%. On multivariate
logistic regression, use of chat rooms (odds ratio {[}OR] - 1.24),
instant messaging (OR - 1.33), Internet gaming (OR - 1.25), and
recreational surfing (OR - 1.25) were independent predictors for
Internet use disorder. Among the personality traits, on multivariate
logistic regression, neuroticism (OR - 1.06) and openness to experience
(OR - 1.09) were positive predictors for the presence of Internet use
disorder and moderate-severe Internet use, while conscientiousness (OR -
0.87) was negative predictor. 19.4\% (34/175) of students had
psychiatric comorbidities (1 comorbidity - 21 students, >1 comorbidities
- 13 students); the most common being major depression (alone or in
combination). Conclusions: In this study, neuroticism and openness to
experience were found to be predictors of Internet use disorder as well
as moderate-severe Internet use. In addition, the use of chat rooms,
instant messaging, online gaming, and recreational surfing was
associated with higher Internet use disorder. A large proportion of
psychiatric comorbidities with Internet use disorder were found.

TI  - Personalized gestural interaction applied in a gesture interactive game-based approach for people with disabilities
AB  - Technology can support people with disabilities to participate in social and economic life. Using relevant Human-Computer Interaction, as obtained through Intelligent User Interfaces, people with motor and speech impairments may be able to communicate in different ways. Augmentative and Alternative Communication supported by Computer Vision systems can benefit from the recognition of users' remaining functional motions as an alternative interaction design approach. Based on a methodology in which gestures and their meanings are created and configured by users and their caregivers, we developed a Computer Vision system, named PGCA, that employs machine learning techniques to create personalized gestural interaction as an Assistive Technology resource for communication purposes. Using a low-cost approach, PGCA has been experienced with students with motor and speech impairments to create personalized gesture datasets and to identify improvements for the system. This paper presents an experiment carried with the target audience using a game-based approach where three students used PGCA to interact with communication boards and to play a game. The system was evaluated by special education professionals using the System Usability Scale and was considered suitable for its purpose. Results from the experiment suggest the technical feasibility for the methodology and for the system, also adding knowledge about the interaction process of disabled people with a game.

TI  - Personalizing health theories in persuasive game interventions to gamer types: an African perspective
AB  - Persuasive games (PGs) informed by behaviour theories are effective tools for motivating health behaviour. It has been shown that tailoring PGs to the target audience increases their effectiveness. However, most existing studies on how to tailor PGs and gameful systems are focused on people from the Western cultures. There is a paucity of research on how to personalize PGs to the African audience. To advance research in this area, we conducted a large-scale study of 360 game players from Africa to investigate their eating habits and associated determinants of health behaviour to understand how health behaviour relates to their gamer types. We developed models showing the determinants of health behaviour for the seven gamer types identified by BrainHex. Our results show that gamer types play significant roles in the impact of various determinants on the health behaviour of Africans. People high in the achiever gamer type are motivated by perceived susceptibility (what they stand to lose), while daredevils are motivated by perceived benefit (what they stand to gain) from adopting a healthy lifestyle. Self-efficacy emerged as the most effective determinant overall, it influences health behaviour positively for all gamer types. We contribute to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research and practice by offering design guidelines for tailoring PGs for health to Africans based on their gamer types.

TI  - Perspectives on Active Video Gaming as a New Frontier in Accessible Physical Activity for Youth With Physical Disabilities
IS  - 4
VL  - 96
AB  - This perspective article explores the utility of active video gaming as a means of reducing sedentary behavior and increasing physical activity among youth with physical disabilities and limitations in lower extremity function who typically are excluded from mainstream exercise options. Youth with physical disabilities are disproportionately affected by health problems that result from sedentary behavior, lack of physical activity, and low fitness levels. Physical, programmatic, and attitudinal barriers have a synergistic and compounded impact on youths' ability to participate in physical activity. A recent health and wellness task force recommendation from the American Physical Therapy Association's Section on Pediatrics supports analyzing individualized health behaviors and preferences that are designed to improve fitness, physical activity, and participation in pediatric rehabilitation. This recommendation represents an opportunity to explore nontraditional options to maximize effectiveness and sustainability of pediatric rehabilitation techniques for youth with disabilities who could best benefit from customized programming. One new frontier in promoting physical activity and addressing common physical activity barriers for youth with physical disabilities is active video games (AVGs), which have received growing attention as a promising strategy for promoting health and fitness in children with and without disabilities. The purpose of this article is to discuss the potential for AVGs as an accessible option to increase physical activity participation for youth with physical disabilities and limitations in lower extremity function. A conceptual model on the use of AVGs to increase physical activity participation for youth with physical disabilities is introduced, and future research potential is discussed, including a development project for game controller adaptations within the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Interactive Exercise Technologies and Exercise Physiology for People With Disabilities (RERC RecTech) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)/Lakeshore Foundation Research Collaborative. © 2016 American Physical Therapy Association.

TI  - Pharmaceutical industry discursives and the marketization of nursing work: A case example
IS  - 3
VL  - 12
AB  - Increasing pharmaceutical industry presence in health care research and practice has evoked critical social, political, economic, and ethical questions and concern among health care providers, ethicists, economists, and the general citizenry. The case example presented of the 'marketization' of nursing practice not only reveals the magnitude of the purview of the pharmaceutical industry, it demonstrates how that industry imparts effect upon the organization of nursing work, an area of health care professional practice where the ethical polemic of pharmaceutical industry involvement and influence has been largely ignored, and the profession of nursing conspicuously silent. Drawing on a Foucauldian dispositive analysis that troubled the complex apparatus responsible for the production of knowledge and action in the neurology subspecialty of multiple sclerosis (MS), the case discloses how the pharmaceutical industry has created compliance and adherence as clinical imperatives in the practice of MS nursing. The case makes explicit the conscious transformative self-action undertaken by MS nurses as a result of their subjectivation (marketization) and demonstrates how MS nurses have become pawns in pharmaceutical industry strategic games of power, truth, identity, and wealth creation by turning their clinical practice settings into heterodiscursive spaces of surveillance and persuasion. MS nurses have become instruments of the pharmaceutical industry, and their clinical practices ordered, organized, limited, constrained, and marketized as a result. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Pharmacists’ perspectives on MedSMA℞T: A serious game to educate youth about opioid safety
IS  - 4
VL  - 63
AB  - Background: Adolescent opioid misuse has been recognized as a dire public health issue. Despite efforts to address the opioid epidemic in the United States, opioid-related morbidity and mortality have continued to rise. Few interventions have been tailored to prevent adolescent opioid misuse. MedSMA℞T: Adventures in PharmaCity (MedSMA℞T), is a serious game that educates the end-user by challenging them to make applicable decisions in a low-stakes environment. Objective: The study aimed to characterize pharmacists’ perspectives on using MedSMA℞T to educate adolescents and families about opioid medication safety. Methods: Pharmacists were recruited from the Pharmacy Practice Enhancement and Action Research Link (PearlRx) and the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin. Consented pharmacists played the MedSMA℞T game for 30 minutes while a research team member observed via Zoom. Virtual semi-structured interviews (45 minutes) were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Two members of the research team independently coded each transcript using NVivo software to conduct inductive thematic analyses. Bi-weekly meetings were held to discuss and refine codes as well as the master codebook, and identify prevalent themes (intercoder reliability, kappa = 0.91). Results: Twenty-two pharmacists were interviewed between August and November 2021. Four themes were identified: game content and design, patient education, implementation barriers, and implementation facilitators. Most pharmacists perceived MedSMA℞T to be an effective resource for opioid safety education. Pharmacists reported that age-appropriate language was used in combination with realistic scenarios and relatable characters. Pharmacists also highlighted the value of interactive gameplay to engage the player to actively learn and recall educational content. Conclusions: Pharmacists play an integral role as medication experts and contributed valuable insights into using and incorporating the MedSMA℞T game into various pharmacy practice settings. Future work is necessary to understand parents’ and adolescents’ perceptions of using MedSMA℞T as an opioid safety education tool in pharmacies. © 2023 American Pharmacists Association®

TI  - Physical Activity and Health Promotion in Esports and Gaming–Discussing Unique Opportunities for an Unprecedented Cultural Phenomenon
VL  - 3
AB  - Due to long periods of sedentary behavior, and unhealthy diets gamers and esports players are at risk for numerous chronic diseases and all-cause mortality. Health research has started addressing the public health implications of the esports phenomenon, drawing a bleak picture of this megatrend. However, instead of just highlighting adverse public health implications of this trend, it is recommended to become involved in this phenomenon and positively influence it. Esports has an enormous potential for physical activity and health-promoting efforts, provides a context for broadly disseminating interventions, and offers new ways of gaining access to an often-neglected population. This paper presents: the potential of the esports phenomenon to promote physical activity, health, and well-being in gamers and esports players; the strategic and preventive solutions to ameliorate esports possible adverse health impacts; and the utilization of esports technology (streams, media platforms, exergames, etc.) as an innovative health promotion tool, especially reaching gamers and esports players with attractive and interactive interventions. This is to encourage systematic scientific research so that evidence-based guidelines and intervention strategies involving regular physical activity, healthy diet, and sleep hygiene for esports will be developed. The goal is to promote public health approaches that move toward a better integration of esports and gaming. Copyright © 2021 Ketelhut, Martin-Niedecken, Zimmermann and Nigg.

TI  - Physical Activity Opportunities in Afterschool Programs
IS  - 3
VL  - 16
AB  - Afterschool programs (ASPs) have potential to provide children moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The availability and types (e.g., free play or organized activities) of physical activity opportunities, their structure (e.g., presence of lines, elimination games), and staff behaviors (e.g., encouragement, engaged) can influence children’s MVPA. This study explored these factors in 20 ASPs serving over 1,700 elementary-age children. The occurrence, types, and structure of physical activity opportunities, and staff behaviors were collected via the SOSPAN (System for Observing Staff Promotion of Physical Activity and Nutrition). A total of 4,660 SOSPAN scans were completed across 63 complete program days (1,733 during physical activity opportunities). Physical activity opportunities were observed on 60 program days across all 20 sites, with 73% of those opportunities classified as free play. ASPs scheduled an average of 66.3 minutes (range 15-150 minutes) of physical activity opportunities daily. Games played included basketball, tag, soccer, and football. Staff rarely engaged in physical activity promotion behaviors, and the structure of organized games discouraged MVPA. For example, staff verbally promoted physical activity in just 6.1% of scans, while organized games were more likely to involve lines and elimination. Professional development training may enhance staffs’ physical activity promotion and the structure of activity opportunities. © 2015 Society for Public Health Education.

TI  - Playful bottle: a mobile social persuasion system to motivate healthy water intake
AB  - This study of mobile persuasion system explores the use of a mobile phone, when attached to an everyday object used by an everyday behavior, becomes a tool to sense and influence that behavior. This mobile persuasion system, called Playful Bottle system, makes use of a mobile phone attached to an everyday drinking mug and motivates office workers to drink healthy quantities of water. A camera and accelerometer sensors in the phone are used to build a vision/motion-based water intake tracker to detect the amount and regularity of water consumed by the user. Additionally, the phone includes hydration games in which natural drinking actions are used as game input. Two hydration games are developed: a single-user TreeGame with automated computer reminders and a multi-user ForestGame with computer-mediated social reminders from members of the group playing the game. Results from 7-week user study with 16 test subjects suggest that both hydration games are effective for encouraging adequate and regular water intake by users. Additionally, results of this study suggest that adding social reminders to the hydration game is more effective than system reminders alone.

TI  - Playing during a crisis: The impact of commercial video games on the reconfiguration of people’s life during the COVID-19 pandemic
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to dramatic changes in people’s lives. The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community widely investigated technology use during crises. However, commercial video games received minor attention. In this article, we describe how video game play impacted the life transformations engendered by the pandemic. We administered a qualitative online survey to 330 video game players who were living in Italy during the lockdown measures. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic altered the participants’ sense of time and space, reshaped both their intimate and wider social interactions, and elicited a wide spectrum of disturbing emotions. Players escaped from this unsatisfying reality into video game worlds, searching for a new normality that could compensate for the unpredictability and dangerousness of the pandemic life, as well as seeking uncertainty in the game environments to balance the flatness of the lockdown everydayness. In doing so, they “appropriated” the gaming technologies, which also led to several unexpected outcomes. Starting from these findings, we propose a model of escapism that points out four ways to escape from reality into video game worlds. Moreover, we outline some design implications that might inspire future strands of research in the field of crisis technologies. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Playing Tetris decreases drug and other cravings in real world settings
VL  - 51
AB  - Most research on cognitive processes in craving has been carried out in the laboratory and focuses on food craving. This study extends laboratory findings to real world settings and cravings for drugs or activities as well as food. Previous laboratory research has found that playing Tetris reduces craving strength. The present study used an ecological momentary assessment protocol in which 31 undergraduate participants carried iPods for a week and were prompted 7 times each day, by SMS message, to use their iPod to report craving. Participants reported craving target and strength (0-100), whether they indulged their previous craving (yes/no), and whether they were under the influence of alcohol (yes/no). Those randomly assigned to the intervention condition (n=15) then played Tetris for 3min and reported their craving again. Those in the monitoring-only control condition (n=16) provided baseline craving data to test if Tetris reduced the incidence and strength of spontaneous cravings across the week. Playing Tetris decreased craving strength for drugs (alcohol, nicotine, caffeine), food and drink, and activities (sex, exercise, gaming), with a mean reduction of 13.9 percentage points, effect size f2=0.11. This effect was consistent across the week. This is the first demonstration that visual cognitive interference can be used in the field to reduce cravings for substances and activities other than eating. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Playing with Prejudice: Do Colour Scheme and Hypersexualization of Women In Games Influence Player Decisions, Perceptions, and Avatar Appeal?
AB  - Hypersexualization of women video game characters through unrealistic body proportions and revealing clothes is common. Previous work suggested that overexposure to sexualized women characters can harm players, through increased self-objectification and higher rape myth acceptance; however, there have been inconsistencies across studies that we suggest may stem from variations in the study design and other visual characteristics of the characters, such as relying heavily on stereotypes reinforced by colour schemes (e.g., blonde princess). To address this, we designed a text-based game prototype and four identical women characters who varied only in their colour scheme (gold/red or purple/black) and amount of sexualization (through bikini armour and exaggerating body proportions). We measure attributes assigned to the avatar, avatar appeal, rape myth acceptance and self-objectification. 82 participants participated in our online-study in 2021. Most participants found the non-sexualized character versions more appealing than the sexualized characters and were more likely to assign ‘manipulativeness’ to the sexualized character. When presented with the sexualized characters, participants demonstrated higher rape myth acceptance, and more self-objectification.

TI  - Positive technology and COVID-19
IS  - 9
VL  - 23
AB  - The past 10 years have seen the development and maturation of several digital technologies that can have a critical role to enhancement of happiness and psychological well-being. In particular, the past decade has seen the emergence of a new paradigm: "Positive Technology,"the scientific and applied approach to the use of technology for improving the quality of our personal experience. In this article we discussed the potential of Positive Technology to augment and enhance the existing strategies for generating psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular different positive technologies - m-Health and smartphone apps, stand-alone and social virtual reality, video games, exergames, and social technologies - have the potential of enhancing different critical features of our personal experience - affective quality, engagement/actualization, and connectedness - that are challenged by the pandemic and its social and economic effects. In conclusion, although the focus of tackling the direct impact of COVID-19 is important, positive technologies can be extremely useful to reduce the psychological burden of the pandemic and to help individuals in flourishing even during difficult and complex times.  © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.

TI  - Precarious Interventions: Designing for Ecologies of Care
IS  - CSCW
VL  - 3
AB  - In this paper, we present ethnographic account of people's everyday behavioral health experiences in the city of Jackson, Michigan to explore community forms of care work through an infrastructural lens. Detailing people's interactions with clinical processes and health policies, local resources, and diverse social worlds, we highlight problematic healthcare delivery gaps, as well as the informal (and often invisible) practices people depend upon to manage their health needs given socioeconomic hardships and cultural concerns. We also discuss the city's efforts to support local behavioral health needs through the development of a community health record. Placing fieldwork findings in conversation with the goals of this ongoing civic design project, we propose the analytic sensibility of precarious intervention to unpack the significance of the infrastructural tensions and power relations at play when people seek solutions to complex sociotechnical problems. Precarious intervention calls for CSCW research that attends to 1) the collective labor necessary to create and maintain ecologies of care in the face of infrastructural brokenness; and 2) the high-stakes and varied costs of 'engagement' for different community stakeholders.

TI  - Predicting transfer from a game-based learning environment
VL  - 146
AB  - This study examined the predictive impact of variables from self-regulated learning models on transfer following multiple gameplay sessions in a classroom game-based learning environment (GBLE). The game focused on science curriculum including map models, map navigation, and landforms. Fifth-grade students (N = 594) interacted with CRYSTAL ISLAND - UNCHARTED DISCOVERY during six 50-min sessions over four weeks integrated with classroom instruction. The transfer activity required students to create an island on grid paper that included at least seven different landforms, a map navigation activity created for peers, and an attached map scale model. Results of multiple regression analyses revealed that when other variables were accounted for, none of the measured motivational variables including interest for the game, performance-approach goal orientation, mastery-approach goal orientation, or self-efficacy for science were significant positive predictors of transfer. Interestingly, video game self-efficacy was a significant negative predictor of transfer performance. Prior knowledge and change in science knowledge after gameplay were also significant predictors of transfer. Girls performed as well as boys on the transfer task despite completing less game quests and had significantly lower posttest content scores. Interest was a consistent predictor of performance for girls but not boys for in-game performance, posttest content scores, and transfer scores. Regression models were systematically less able to predict performance moving from content knowledge, to in-game performance, to transfer. Implications for the design of GBLEs to facilitate transfer are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Predicting Video Game Behavior
IS  - 5
VL  - 10
AB  - A study (N = 1,995) is presented that investigated whether the Big Five Inventory personality types - agreeableness, conscientiousness, extroversion, neuroticism, and openness - can be used in explaining mobile game play. The study is predicated on research suggesting that relationships exist between certain personality types and willingness to embrace technology and mobile phone ownership. The same might be argued between personality and certain mobile apps, to include games. Little research, however, has examined personality and mobile games. This is unfortunate, as these games lend themselves naturally to problem-solving challenges and are believed to aid with learning. Findings revealed that agreeableness was the most significant personality type in predicting frequency and number of hours spent playing mobile games, while openness was the most consistent predictor of mobile gaming as a whole. However, overall strength of associations was weak, suggesting care in using personality, as it may be a poor predictor. © The Author(s) 2015.

TI  - Predictors of problematic internet use in the everyday internet
activities of a French representative sample: The importance of
psychological traits
VL  - 153
AB  - Recent years have seen growing concern about the detrimental effects of
digital activities on well-being and mental health. A major axis of
concern is problematic internet use (PIU): dysregulated or excessive
uses of online websites or applications, which can interfere with other
daily-life activities. Given potential health impacts, better
understanding of the predictors of PIU is warranted. This study
investigated possible socio-demographic and psychological determinants
of PIU for various types of Internet activities. We recruited a sample
of 1504 participants representative of the French population aged 15 and
above. Socio-demographic variables (sex, age, income, educational
attainment) and psychological traits (dispositional flow, trait and
state anxiety, fear of missing out) were surveyed, along with
problematic uses in major digital activities (gambling, streaming,
social media, video game, shopping, news, cybersex). The results showed
that fear of missing out had the most explanatory power for PIU,
followed by anxiety. Contrary to our expectations, socio-demographic
variables explained very little variance in PIU, with only age emerging
as a weak predictor in some analyses. Overall, psychological traits
appeared to be more promising predictors of problematic uses, with
detrimental effects of fear of missing out and anxiety presumably
reflecting maladaptive coping strategies or unfulfillment of
psychological needs. These results open up discussion regarding the
design of digital platforms and public mental health policy.

TI  - Predictors of Smartphone’s Gaming Addiction among Generation Z Consumers: An Empirical Investigation from Pakistan
IS  - 4
VL  - 17
AB  - Smartphone games are played on smartphones, such as smartphones or feature phones; personal digital assistants; tablets that can handle gaming consoles; and portable media players with internet connectivity. People are becoming addicted to smartphone games. Few researches have examined such addiction's causes, including perceived social and psychological factors. Practitioners, researchers, and academics alike are keenly interested in examining the causes of smartphone gaming addiction. Thus, this study examines the antecedents of smartphone phone gaming addiction. Self-determination theory was used to propose a theoretical model, which was validated using partial least square structural equation modeling on 421 smartphone game players of Generation-Z. Data were collected through structured questionnaires. The study reveals that materialism, enjoyment, and peer pressure positively affect Generation-Z's psychological engagement and smartphone gaming addiction. This study also reveals that psychological engagement can act as mediator between materialism, enjoyment, peer pressure, and smartphone gaming addiction. These players eventually develop a smartphone gaming addiction because of various elements encouraging them to play smartphone games regularly. Businesses can benefit from understanding consumer behaviors related to smartphone use. This knowledge can be used for well-informed marketing strategies, product development, and customer engagement initiatives, recognizing the prevalence and potential consequences of smartphone addiction. © (2023), (Johar Education Society Pakistan).

TI  - Preferences for a Game-Based SMS Adherence Intervention Among Young People Living with HIV in Ghana: A Qualitative Study
IS  - 7
VL  - 26
AB  - Young people living with HIV (YPLH) are at risk for poor treatment adherence. Short message service (SMS) interventions can improve adherence, yet few exist for YPLH. Our study investigated preferences for a game-based SMS intervention among YPLH in Ghana. Thirty-two YPLH, ages 18 to 24, were recruited from an HIV clinic to complete in-depth interviews. Content analysis of interview data revealed areas of technology use relevant to intervention implementation, including mobile communication preferences, internet access, and mobile game use. Participants reported high perceived utility towards intervention features: treatment reminders, gamification components, and involvement of supportive individuals (e.g., providers). Issues with privacy, literacy, and cultural/developmental appropriateness were among concerns raised. Suggestions were made for strengthening basic SMS features (e.g., using code words to protect privacy) and incorporating advanced features (e.g., simplifying game interactions). This novel approach may help engage YPLH in HIV care if carefully developed with attention towards its mechanisms and user preferences. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Presence Promotes Performance on a Virtual Spatial Cognition Task:
Impact of Human Factors on Virtual Reality Assessment
VL  - 1
AB  - The use of virtual reality in spatial cognition evaluation has been
growing rapidly, mainly because of its potential applications in the
training and diagnosis of cognitive impairment and its ability to blend
experimental control and ecological validity. However, there are still
many gray areas on virtual reality, notably on the sense of presence and
its complex relationship to task performance. Performance in VR is often
suggested to be influenced by other human factors including, amongst
others, cybersickness, gender, video game experience, and field
dependence. Would an individual experiencing more presence
systematically show better performance? This study aimed to be part of a
framework of virtual reality as this question is fundamental for
rigorous assessment and diagnostics, and particularly in the spatial
cognition field. Forty-eight healthy young subjects were recruited to
take part in a virtual spatial cognition evaluation. Spatial cognition
performance, along with their level of presence, cybersickness, video
game experience, gender and field dependence, were measured. Matrix
correlations were used, along with linear regressions and mediation
analysis. Results show that presence promoted performance on the spatial
cognition evaluation, while cybersickness symptoms hindered it, notably
among women. The presence-performance relationship was not mediated by
other human factors. Video game experience significantly predicted both
sense of presence and cybersickness, the latter two being negatively
correlated. Even if women experienced more negative symptoms than men,
gender appears less informative than cybersickness and video game
experience. Field dependence was not associated with any other variable.
Results are discussed by confronting two theories of cognition
(representational vs. ecological), highlighting that virtual reality is
not a simple transposition of reality but truly a new paradigm with its
own biases favoring some individuals more than others, and that some
human factors have to be controlled for rigorous uses of virtual
environments, particularly for spatial cognition evaluation.

TI  - Preserved reward outcome processing in ASD as revealed by event-related potentials
IS  - 1
VL  - 4
AB  - Background Problems with reward system function have been posited as a primary difficulty in autism spectrum disorders. The current study examined an electrophysiological marker of feedback monitoring, the feedback-related negativity (FRN), during a monetary reward task. The study advanced prior understanding by focusing exclusively on a developmental sample, applying rigorous diagnostic characterization and introducing an experimental paradigm providing more subtly different feedback valence (reward versus non-reward instead of reward versus loss). Methods Twenty-six children with autism spectrum disorder and 28 typically developing peers matched on age and full-scale IQ played a guessing game resulting in monetary gain ("win") or neutral outcome ("draw"). ERP components marking early visual processing (N1, P2) and feedback appraisal (FRN) were contrasted between groups in each condition, and their relationship to behavioral measures of social function and dysfunction, social anxiety, and autism symptomatology were explored. Results FRN was observed on draw trials relative to win trials. Consistent with prior research, children with ASD exhibited a FRN to suboptimal outcomes that was comparable to typical peers. ERP parameters were unrelated to behavioral measures. Conclusions Results of the current study indicate typical patterns of feedback monitoring in the context of monetary reward in ASD. The study extends prior findings of normative feedback monitoring to a sample composed exclusively of children and demonstrates that, as in typical development, individuals with autism exhibit a FRN to suboptimal outcomes, irrespective of neutral or negative valence. Results do not support a pervasive problem with reward system function in ASD, instead suggesting any dysfunction lies in more specific domains, such as social perception, or in response to particular feedback-monitoring contexts, such as selfevaluation of one's errors. © 2012 McPartland et al.

TI  - Prevalence of Eating Disorders in Elite Athletes Is Higher Than in the General Population
IS  - 1
VL  - 14
AB  - Objective: The objectives of the study were to examine the prevalence of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), anorexia athletica (AA), and eating disorders not otherwise specified (ED-NOS) in both male and female Norwegian elite athletes and a representative sample from the general Norwegian population. Design: A 2-step study including self-reported questionnaire and clinical interview. Setting/Participants: The entire population of Norwegian male and female elite athletes (n = 1620) and controls (n = 1696) was evaluated for the presence of eating disorders (EDs). Main Outcome Measurement: Based on the results of the questionnaire, all athletes and controls classified as at risk for EDs, and a representative sample of athletes and controls classified as healthy participated in the clinical part of the study to determine the number of subjects meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria for EDs. Results: More athletes (13.5%) than controls (4.6%; P < 0.001) had subclinical or clinical EDs. The prevalence of EDs among male athletes was greater in antigravitation sports (22%) than in ball game (5%) and endurance sports (9%; P < 0.05). The prevalence of EDs among female athletes competing in aesthetic sports (42%) was higher than that observed in endurance (24%), technical (17%), and ball game sports (16%). Conclusions: The prevalence of EDs is higher in athletes than in controls, higher in female athletes than in male athletes, and more common among those competing in leanness-dependent and weight-dependent sports than in other sports. A collaborative effort among coaches, athletic trainers, parents, physicians, and athletes is optimal for recognizing, preventing, and treating EDs in athletes.

TI  - Prevalence of Internet-based addictive behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review
IS  - 4
VL  - 39
AB  - With the outbreak of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many countries have imposed lockdowns which have caused an increase in Internet use. As large-scale disasters may have an impact on addictions, a review on Internet-based addictive behaviors seems necessary. The goals of this review are to find whether Internet-based addictive behaviors have increased during the pandemic and to define the main reasons for this increase. The systematic search was conducted in Google Scholar, Science Direct, PsycINFO, and PubMed in October of 2020, to determine the current evidence and observations concerning the Internet-based addictive behaviors amid COVID-19. Studies were included if they considered the Internet-based addictive behaviors during the current pandemic. We used all the names of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2 previously 2019 nCoV), the name of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and common Internet-based addictive behaviors, namely Internet addiction, online gaming disorder, online gambling disorder, pornography use, and smartphone use disorder. The study design is PEOs, finding if individuals’ exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in Internet-based addictive behaviors. The quality of the studies was assessed independently by two authors using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The articles found in this review proved an increase in Internet-based addictive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic mostly due to financial hardships, isolation, problematic substance use, and mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress. Effective interventions should be scaled up to prevent and reduce online addictive behaviors, as well as accessible guidelines, particularly for adolescents. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Preventing substance abuse and relationship violence: Proof-of-concept
evaluation of a social, multi-user, tablet-based game
VL  - 53
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that using technology and Internet-based
methods in prevention programming can be an efficacious delivery
practice. This literature implies that applying digital technologies to
prevention may provide a unique opportunity to carry out interventions
with reliability and in a manner that is more appealing and suitable to
youth. This exploratory study reports on a proof-of-concept evaluation
of Choices \& Consequences, a substance abuse and relationship violence
prevention program that integrates digital technologies and devices with
game-based behavior change techniques. Six focus groups (N = 44) were
conducted with youth living in a SouthweStem city. Results suggest that
youth preferred various aspects of this prevention game to traditional
methods. They especially liked that the game was engaging and that they
were able to learn in both formal and informal environments, that is
interacting with each other and a facilitator or playing the game on
their own, Results also found that youth learned many lessons while
playing the game and they believe the game may help prevent substance
abuse and relationship violence among the target population of early
adolescents. Thus, this research suggests that prevention programs for
youth that combine interactive methods, mobile technology, social
networking, and competitive gaming could be a strong alternative to
traditional delivery methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI  - Prevention of HIV and Other Sexually Transmitted Infections by
Geofencing and Contextualized Messages With a Gamified App, UBESAFE:
Design and Creation Study
IS  - 3
VL  - 8
AB  - Background: Advances in the development of information and communication
technologies have facilitated social and sexual interrelationships,
thanks to the websites and apps created to this end. However, these
resources can also encourage sexual contacts without appropriate
preventive measures in relation to HIV and other sexually transmitted
infections (STIs). How can users be helped to benefit from the
advantages of these apps while keeping in mind those preventive
measures?
Objective: This study aimed to prevent STIs by helping users to remember
preventive measures in the risky situations.
Methods: We have used the design and creation methodology and have
developed a software system. This system has two parts: an Android
operating system app with emphasis on ubiquitous computing and
gamification as well as a server with a webpage. First, a functional
test with 5 men who have sex with men (MSM) allowed us to test the app
with end users. In addition, a feasibility test with 4 MSM for a month
allowed us to try the UBESAFE system with all its functionalities.
Results: The main output is a system called UBESAFE that is addressed to
MSM. The system has two main parts: (1) an app that sends preventive
contextualized messages to users when they use a contact app or when
they are near a point where sexual contacts are likely and (2) a server
part that was managed by the public health agency of Barcelona (ASPB),
which preserves the quality and pertinence of messages and places and
offers instant help to users. To increase users' adherence, UBESAFE uses
a gamified system to engage users in the creation of preventive
messages. Users increased the initial pool of messages by more than
100\% (34/30) and created more than 56\% (9/16) of places (named hot
zones).
Conclusions: The system helped MSM who used it to become conscious about
HIV and other STIs. The system also helped the ASPB to stay in contact
with MSM and to detect behaviors that could benefit from preventive
measures. All functions were performed in a nonintrusive manner because
users used the app privately. Furthermore, the system has shown how
important it is to make users a part of the creation process as well as
to develop apps that work by themselves and thus become useful to the
users.

TI  - Primary Prevention of Intimate Partner Violence Among Recently Married
Dyads Residing in the Slums of Pune, India: Development and Rationale
for a Dyadic Intervention
IS  - 1
VL  - 8
AB  - Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is frequently experienced by
women of low socioeconomic status in India. It is a human rights
violation and associated with negative effects on physical and mental
well-being, underscoring the need for effective prevention strategies.
Objective: This study aimed to develop a dyadic intervention for the
primary prevention of IPV among newly married couples residing in slum
communities in India.
Methods: The intervention was developed using a community-based,
mixed-methods design rooted in couple-interdependence theory and guided
by the intervention mapping (IM) framework. It used the six critical IM
steps to inform the content and delivery of the intervention: (1) needs
assessment, (2) preparation of matrices of change objectives, (3)
selection of theory-based methods and practical applications, (4)
production of intervention components and materials, (5) intervention
adoption and implementation, and (6) evaluation planning.
Results: The resulting Ghya Bharari Ekatra (Take a Flight Together)
intervention is intended to be delivered in 6 weekly sessions by a
trained pair of male and female lay community educators to groups of 3
to 5 newly married couples in the community in which they reside. It
uses games, discussions, self-reflections, and skill-building exercises
to cover the following topics: enhancing relationship quality time,
self-esteem and resilience, communication and conflict management, goal
setting and implementation, sexual communication and sexual health and
reproductive health knowledge, and redefining and challenging norms
surrounding IPV occurrence. The formative work guided the protocol,
including module duration and timing (2-hour sessions of convenience to
participants), ordering of modules (based on potential level of interest
and sensitivity of the topics), content (ie, informed scripts of role
plays and films), intervention delivery methods (ie, interactive
activities), and selection of the interventionists (based on capacity to
connect with participants) and venue (community-based, convenient, and
safe spaces). Ghya Bharari Ekatra was piloted between January and May
2018, and evaluation is presently underway.
Conclusions: Ghya Bharari Ekatra is evidence-based, grounded in
intervention-mapping, and developed and iteratively refined using a
community-based participatory research approach, suggesting it has great
potential to be an acceptable and effective solution to preventing IPV
among newly married couples.

TI  - Problematic Facebook use and problematic video gaming as mediators of relationship between impulsivity and life satisfaction among female and male gamers
IS  - 8 August
VL  - 15
AB  - Over the past few decades, many new technologies have emerged, such as portable computers, the internet and smartphones, which have contributed to improving the lives of individuals. While the benefits of these new technologies are overwhelmingly positive, negative consequences are experienced by a minority of individuals. One possible negative aspect of new technologies is their problematic use due to impulsive use which may lead to lower life satisfaction. The present study investigated the mediating role of problematic video gaming (PVG) and problematic Facebook use (PFU) in the relationship between impulsivity dimensions and life satisfaction as well as the relationship between impulsivity dimensions and problematic behaviors. Additionally, the potential impact of gender differences was also examined. The study comprised 673 gamers (391 females) aged 17–38 years (M = 21.25 years, SD = 2.67) selected from 1365 individuals who completed an offline survey. PFU was assessed using the Facebook Intrusion Scale, and PVG was assessed using the nine-item Internet Gaming Disorder Scale–Short-Form (IGDS9-SF). Impulsivity dimensions such as attention, cognitive instability, motor, perseverance, self-control, and cognitive complexity were assessed using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), and life satisfaction was assessed using the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Depending on the specific impulsivity dimension, findings showed both positive and negative relationships between impulsivity and life satisfaction. Attention and perseverance subtypes of impulsivity were primarily associated with problematic behaviors. Additionally, cognitive complexity was associated with PFU among female gamers, whereas cognitive instability was associated with PVG among male gamers. Additionally, PVG was primarily associated with lower life satisfaction. However, there was no mediation effects between impulsivity dimensions and life satisfaction via PFU or PVG. These findings provide a better understanding of the relationship between problematic behaviors, life satisfaction, and impulsivity among gamers and the differences between male and female gamers. © 2020 Cudo et al.

TI  - Problematic gaming behavior and the personality traits of video gamers: A cross-sectional survey.
VL  - 106
AB  - Current psychological models for the development of specific internet-use disorders consider predisposing core characteristics (e.g. biopsychological constitution, psychopathology, early childhood experiences, and personality traits) that are involved in the early behavioral addiction process. The cross-sectional study discussed in this paper examined several likely relevant psychological variables in a group of 820 video gamers (217 women, 597 men), who visited the world's largest trade fair for video games in 2018. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess the extent of pathological gaming, Big Five personality traits, self-efficacy, depression symptoms, and general life satisfaction. In comparison to individuals with unproblematic gaming behavior, gamers with problematic gaming behavior scored significantly higher for neuroticism, depression symptoms, and time spent playing; and lower for self-efficacy, extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness. No difference was found in terms of agreeableness. Gamers who preferred to play massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) or first-person shooter games (FPS) presented particularly high levels of time spent playing and increased problematic gaming behavior. When considering the entire group of 820 video gamers, high levels of depressive symptoms and neuroticism, extensive time spent playing, as well as low levels of conscientiousness were identified as significant predictor variables regarding problematic gaming. In total, 238 of the 820 video gamers (29.0%) demonstrated problematic gaming behaviors. © 2020

TI  - Problematic Use of ICTs in Trainee Teachers during COVID-19: A Sex-Based
Analysis
IS  - 4
VL  - 13
AB  - The excessive use of ICTs is a growing problem among young people. The
social isolation caused by COVID-19 can increase these inappropriate
behaviour. This study aims at analysing the problematic use of ICTs in
trainee teachers based on the gender variable before and after the
COVID-19 lockdown based on the gender variable. A longitudinal panel
design was carried out with pre-test and post-test measurements based on
the gender variable. The sample consisted of 147 students from the
Faculty of Education at the University of Malaga who were tested using a
validated instrument: MULTICAGE-TIC. The results show that women used
ICTs at a higher risk than men before lockdown, except for video games.
During lockdown, men obtain higher scores than women in all the analysed
ICTs (except for mobile phones). Both genders reach dependency level in
all ICTs except for video games in women. The significant increase in
all ICTs shows that the effects of the pandemic, such as restrictions on
mobility and social interaction, have influenced such growth.

TI  - Promoting dental hygiene to children: Comparing traditional and interactive media following threat appeals
IS  - 5
VL  - 19
AB  - Until now, social marketing campaigns mainly targeted children using traditional media. However, little is known about the effectiveness of computer games to communicate health-related information to children. This study compares the impact of an interactive game as a medium to provide health information and improve children's dietary habits to the impact of more traditional media. Using a 2 × 3 between-subject factorial design with 190 children (7-9 years old), this study investigates the effect of threat messages (weak vs. strong) concerning dental hygiene on behavioral outcome (snack choice), and how this effect is moderated by the type of medium used to communicate subsequent health information after the threat appeal (computer game, information brochure, narrative story). Results show a positive significant effect of perceived threat on children's adaptive behavior. However, this effect only remains significant when afterwards children are exposed to a narrative health-related story. When children play a game or read a brochure, they need to devote more attention to process this content, distracting them from the original threat message. In sum, when a threat message is followed by additional health information, the medium through which this information is presented influences the effectiveness of the preceding threat message. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Promoting Healthy Behaviors Through an RPG Videogame: An Elaboration Likelihood Model Based Approach
IS  - 1
VL  - 16
AB  - Serious games, due to their massiveness, attractiveness, and enjoyment, are widely used for education, promoting healthy behaviors, and for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STI). Serious game design includes tailored narratives, game mechanics, and art for their purpose. Nevertheless, using theories of attitude change to create a videogame to promote healthy behavior is less common. Following contemporary theories on persuasion, we developed and tested an RPG videogame for mobile phones, in which participants had to think in favor of the use of condoms through a series of tasks within the game in order to promote positive attitudes and consonant behavioral intention (BI). Results show a positive correlation between thoughts, attitudes, and BI, and that attitudes can partially mediate (account for) the association between thoughts and BI. In this exploratory study, we showed that 1) it was possible to include an Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)-based approach into a videogame; 2) consistent with previous studies, attitudes partially mediated the association between thoughts and condom use (BI) in a videogame environment; and 3) applications of this strategy can be considered in the game design process to build new serious games for prevention in health care.

TI  - Promoting Parent-Child Sexual Health Dialogue with an Intergenerational Game: Parent and Youth Perspectives
IS  - 2
VL  - 4
AB  - Objectives: Sexual health discussions between parents and their preadolescent youth can delay sexual debut and increase condom and contraceptive use. However, parents frequently report being uncomfortable talking with their youth about sex, often reporting a lack of self-efficacy and skills to inform and motivate responsible decision making by youth. Intergenerational games may support parent-youth sexual health communication. The purpose of this study was to explore parent and youth perspectives on a proposed intergenerational game designed to increase effective parent-youth sexual health communication and skills training. Materials and Methods: Eight focus groups were conducted: four with parents (n=20) and four with their 11-14-year-old youth (n=19), to identify similarities and differences in perspectives on gaming context, delivery channel, content, and design (components, features, and function) that might facilitate dyadic sexual health communication. Results: Participants concurred that a sex education game could improve communication while being responsive to family time constraints. They affirmed the demand for an immersive story-based educational adventure game using mobile platforms and flexible communication modalities. Emergent themes informed the development of a features inventory (including educational and gaming strategies, communication components, channel, and setting) and upper-level program flow to guide future game development. Conclusions: This study supports the potential of a game to be a viable medium to bring a shared dyadic sexual health educational experience to parents and youth that could engage them in a motivationally appealing way to meaningfully impact their sexual health communication and youth sexual risk behaviors. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

TI  - Promoting Sex Education among Teenagers Through an Interactive Game: Reasons for Success and Implications
IS  - 3
VL  - 4
AB  - Objectives: A game application, "Making Smart Choices", was developed to fill the gap of limited easy-to-access resources available on sex education in Hong Kong and to disseminate correct knowledge and positive attitudes toward sex to teenagers using popular platforms such as tablets, Facebook, and the Web. Subjects and Methods: Three versions of the game (iPAD, Facebook, and Web-based) were developed using HTML5. A theoretical framework that involved game-based learning and participatory design approach was used to design, develop, modify, and optimize the game for use with secondary school students (n=1176) 12-16 years of age. Pre- and post-test scores of students' safer sex knowledge were compared to test the effectiveness of the game. Students' survey and interviews were analyzed to assess participant feelings and attitudes toward the game. Results: The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test indicated that students' sex knowledge (n=788) improved with a medium effect size (0.477) after playing the game. Increases in positive attitudes toward sex and relationship and in awareness of making smart sexual choices were reported from student surveys and interviews. Students described the game as "interesting," "interactive," "informative," and "real-to-life." Conclusions: We advocate that the participatory design approach, which supports collaborative efforts of different stakeholders, is an effective framework for developing game-based learning tools for sex education. Our work provides preliminary findings that suggest game-based learning, preferably delivered through popular interactive platforms, can be effective in promoting sex education to teenagers. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.

TI  - ProTesters: a board game for teaching the testing process
AB  - Despite being the most used approach in teaching software testing in Brazil, the traditional teaching method might not simulate, facilitate or motivate the learning of the testing process and its activities. As a result, undergraduate students may not understand a basic testing process and its components, nor be motivated to learn about the content. One approach that can facilitate the teaching of the software testing process and promote student motivation is educational games. Although there are several educational games for teaching software testing, no game was foun on literature that addresses the entire testing process, with its roles, artifacts and activities. This work presents the development of an educational game to support and motivate the learning of a basic software testing process. The research method was Design Science Research. For the development of the game, several playtestings were carried out to verify if the new proposal was able to motivate and teach the proposed content. To evaluate the fulfillment of the research objectives, an experiment was performed with 16 participants, and it was possible to verify a gain of specific knowledge of the participants after the experience with the game. In addition, positive effects were observed on motivational aspects perceived by the players with the game for the learning of the themes involved.

TI  - Publicizing female athletes' weights: Implications for female psychology undergraduates acting as spectators
IS  - 3
VL  - 85
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of including female athletes' weights in athletic event programs on female spectators' body image, eating disorder symptoms, self-esteem, and affective state and to investigate whether the magnitude of the athletes' reported weights had differential effects on female spectators (i.e., do female spectators who view heavier athletes respond differently than those who view less heavy athletes?). Method: We used an experimental design to examine hypotheses derived from competing theories to determine whether exposure to female athletes of varying weight would adversely or beneficially impact female undergraduates (N = 152) who served as athletic event spectators. Results: Analyses indicated that in this simulated study, female spectators' body image, eating disorder symptoms, self-esteem, and affective states were not impacted by the presence or by the magnitude of female athletes' weights in athletic event programs. Conclusion: The results imply that including athletes' weights in game-day programs at women's athletic events does not affect female spectators on an individual level. © 2014 Copyright © SHAPE America.

TI  - Real-time gait classification for persuasive smartphone apps: structuring the literature and pushing the limits
AB  - Persuasive technology is now mobile and context-aware. Intelligent analysis of accelerometer signals in smartphones and other specialized devices has recently been used to classify activity (e.g., distinguishing walking from cycling) to encourage physical activity, sustainable transport, and other social goals. Unfortunately, results vary drastically due to differences in methodology and problem domain. The present report begins by structuring a survey of current work within a new framework, which highlights comparable characteristics between studies; this provided a tool by which we and others can understand the current state-of-the art and guide research towards existing gaps. We then present a new user study, positioned in an identified gap, that pushes limits of current success with a challenging problem: the real-time classification of 15 similar and novel gaits suitable for several persuasive application areas, focused on the growing phenomenon of exercise games. We achieve a mean correct classification rate of 78.1% of all 15 gaits with a minimal amount of personalized training of the classifier for each participant when carried in any of 6 different carrying locations (not known a priori). When narrowed to a subset of four gaits and one location that is known, this improves to means of 92.2% with and 87.2% without personalization. Finally, we group our findings into design guidelines and quantify variation in accuracy when an algorithm is trained for a known location and participant.

TI  - Reciprocal associations between electronic media use and behavioral difficulties in preschoolers
IS  - 4
VL  - 15
AB  - The use of electronic media has increased substantially and is already observable in young children. The present study explored associations of preschoolers’ use of electronic media with age, gender, and socio-economic status, investigated time trends, and examined reciprocal longitudinal relations between children’s use of electronic media and their behavioral difficulties. The study participants included 527 German two- to six-year-old children whose parents had provided information on their use of electronic media and their behavioral difficulties at two time points, with approximately 12 months between baseline and follow-up. The analyses revealed that older vs. younger children, as well as children from families with a lower vs. higher socio-economic status, were more often reported to use electronic media. Furthermore, the usage of mobile phones increased significantly between 2011 and 2016. Most interestingly, baseline usage of computer/Internet predicted more emotional and conduct problems at follow-up, and baseline usage of mobile phones was associated with more conduct problems and hyperactivity or inattention at follow-up. Peer relationship problems at baseline, on the other hand, increased the likelihood of using computer/Internet and mobile phones at follow-up. The findings indicate that preschoolers’ use of electronic media, especially newer media such as computer/Internet and mobile phones, and their behavioral difficulties are mutually related over time. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Recommendations for the Development of a Mobile HIV Prevention
Intervention for Men Who Have Sex With Men and Hijras in Mumbai:
Qualitative Study
IS  - 2
VL  - 4
AB  - Background: As Internet and mobile phone use expands in India, there is
an opportunity to develop mobile health (mHealth) interventions for
marginalized populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM) and
hijras (transgender women), hesitant to access traditional health care
systems.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if an mHealth
intervention was acceptable to MSM and hijras living in Mumbai, and if
so, what features would be useful in targeting the prevention of HIV
acquisition and to increase the quality of life among persons living
with HIV/AIDS.
Methods: Data from 4 focus groups with MSM and interviews with 4 hijras,
10 health service providers, and 8 mHealth developers were thematically
analyzed.
Results: Once the need for an mHealth intervention was confirmed,
comments about features were organized into 3 themes: content,
interface, and retention. Content subthemes included providing sex
education for younger community members, providing information about
STIs, and providing information and social support for persons living
with HIV. Interface subthemes included presenting content using
pictures; using videos to present stories of role models; using push
notifications for testing, appointment, and medication reminders; using
geolocation to link to just-in-time services; and using telemedicine to
increase access to health service providers and community services. The
5 retention subthemes included keeping it fun, using gaming mechanics,
developing content in regional languages, protecting confidentiality,
and linking to social networking apps.
Conclusions: These findings may help inform mHealth development in
India.

TI  - Record or Recall? Exploring Self-Reported Dietary Assessment Methods for Office Workers during the COVID-19 Work-from-Home Period
AB  - The workplace represents an important venue to influence eating behaviors. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the workplace has rapidly shifted from office to home (WfH). Here, two mobile self-reported dietary assessment methods were compared (4-hour Recall vs. Food Record) to monitor food intake for WfH. A within-subject study involving 30 participants was conducted over a 4-week period. We assessed the workload and acceptance of these two methods using questionnaires and follow-up interviews. Results of questionnaires revealed that most participants presented high acceptance of Food Record related to a more flexible completion time and lower mental burden. Based on interviews, we presented a set of design insights to promote WfH healthy eating, including integrating reminders into daily routines, simplifying the tracking process, and adding gaming elements. Then, we discussed design implications, including integrating digital tools into daily routines and designing simple and playful using processes, to promote healthy eating during the WfH period.

TI  - Redesigning the Healthcare Model to Address Obesity Problem Using the Integration of Processes and Mobile Technologies: Facing a Worldwide Epidemic in an Innovative Manner
IS  - 4
VL  - 96
AB  - Obesity and other lifestyle-related illnesses are among the top global healthcare challenges today. The obesity in youth is an alarming predictor for obesity in adulthood as well as the possibility of other short-term health complications. Knowledge about staying healthy is not enough to motivate young individuals to adopt healthy lifestyles. However, relevant progress can be achieved through the integration of processes and mobile technologies. An effective new healthcare model to prevent obesity in the youth population is proposed, incorporating the development of an innovative multi-dimensional cross-disciplinary ICT framework. Sophisticated game mechanics would be used to motivate behavior changes towards healthier lifestyles. Three main functions would be supported: individual and environmental monitoring, including wearable sensors, mobile phones and multimedia diaries; feedback to users, presenting personalized healthy options for alternative lifestyles; and social connectivity, encouraging involvement in sharing experiences through social networks and social engagement. System development would be based on user-centered design, social and networking games as well as online education. Support would be provided by a wide ecosystem of stakeholders including health authorities and research institutions, industries and academia from the ICT and healthcare sectors, as well as food companies and SMEs. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Reducing distress and improving social functioning in daily life in people with auditory verbal hallucinations: Study protocol for the Temstem' randomised controlled trial
IS  - 3
VL  - 8
AB  - Introduction Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are prevalent experiences that can induce distress and impede social functioning. While most voice hearers benefit from antipsychotic medication or cognitive-behavioural therapy, additional effective interventions are needed to reduce the burden of experiencing AVH. Temstem' is an easily accessible and useable smartphone application that was developed by designers in close cooperation with voice hearers and experts. By using language games, Temstem aims to reduce distress and improve social functioning. Methods This is a single-blind multicentre randomised controlled trial with two arms: Temstem+AVH monitoring' versus AVH monitoring' (total n=100). Participants are adult patients who suffer daily from AVH and will be recruited in outpatient units. Primary assessment in daily life is made by the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) and daily monitoring with the PsyMate app. During an ESM period of 6 days, participants assess their mental state (including AVH and context) several times a day by filling in short questionnaires. There are three 6-day ESM periods: at baseline (week 0-1), post-treatment (weeks 5-6) and follow-up (weeks 9-10). In addition, during the entire 10-week study period, all participants monitor their AVH two times a day with a short assessment via the PsyMate app. Participants in the Temstem+AVH monitoring condition are provided with the Temstem app from week 1 to 6. Other assessments made at baseline, post-treatment and follow-up are based on questionnaires and a clinical interview. Ethics and dissemination The results from this study will provide an evaluation of the effectiveness of Temstem, a non-invasive and easily accessible app for voice hearers, and insight into the determinants of optimal use. Results will be disseminated unreservedly, irrespective of the magnitude or direction of the effects. This study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Centre (METC number: 2015.435/NL53684.029.15).

TI  - Reducing HIV-related stigma among health-care professionals: a
game-based experiential approach
IS  - 7
VL  - 27
AB  - Stigmatizing attitudes from health professionals toward people living
with HIV (PLHIV) constitute a key barrier to HIV care. Despite
considerable progress in HIV stigma-reduction research, we are still
searching for effective strategies that can be implemented on a larger
scale. To narrow this research gap, the present study investigated a
novel cost-effective approach to reducing HIV-related stigma among
health professionals. Interactive experiential games were used to help
participants gain first-hand experience of potential stressors that
PLHIV might encounter. The effectiveness of this game-based experiential
approach was compared with that of in vivo contact in reducing
HIV-related stigma among students in the health-care fields.
Eighty-eight students of health-related programs in Hong Kong were
randomly assigned to either the game-based or in vivo contact program.
They completed measures of stigmatizing attitudes and HIV/AIDS-related
knowledge at pre-program, post-program, and one-month follow-up.
Findings showed that the effectiveness of the game-based experiential
approach in reducing HIV-related stigma was similar to that of in vivo
contact both at post-program and one-month follow-up. Further research
is needed to explore the potential value of the game-based approach in
reducing HIV stigma among health professionals.

TI  - Relationship of sleep quality with screen-based sedentary time and
physical activity in adolescents - the moderating effect of body mass
index
IS  - 4
VL  - 26
AB  - Objective To analyze the association of sleep quality with reported
screen-based sedentary time and reported physical activity, among
overweight adolescents. Methods Adolescents aged 10 to 17 years enrolled
in public and private schools were included. Data collection was carried
out during the school semesters of 2014-2015 and participants who did
not participate in all evaluations were excluded. Sleep quality and
physical activity were assessed by validated questionnaires.
Screen-based sedentary time was assessed by self-reported mean daily
hours spent on television, computer, smartphone/tablet, and videogames.
Body mass index was objectively measured and adolescents were classified
into normal weight and overweight according to cutoff points for age and
sex. Multiple linear regression models adjusted by covariates (age, sex,
ethnicity, and socioeconomic status) were used to analyze the
relationship between variables. Results A total of 1008 adolescents were
assessed, with a mean age of 13.2 +/- 2.4 years and a mean body mass
index of 20.4 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2). Overweight was observed in 28.0\% of
sample, while 53.0\% reported non-white ethnicity. Self-reported
screen-based sedentary time was significantly related to poor sleep
quality in adolescents (beta = 0.116, p = 0.005), remaining significant
only in those who were normal weight (beta = 0.101, p = 0.007) in
sensitivity analysis. Self-reported physical activity showed no
relationship with sleep quality in both normal weight and overweight
adolescents. Conclusion Self-reported screen-based sedentary time was
associated with poor sleep quality in adolescents, mainly among those
with normal weight. The time spent on screen-based sedentary activities
can impair sleep quality even in normal weight adolescents.

TI  - Relationships of internet gaming reasons to biological indicators and risk of internet gaming addiction in Korean adolescent male game users
IS  - 1
VL  - 20
AB  - Background: There are no standard diagnostic criteria or interventions for internet gaming addiction (IGA) even though IGA is one of the most pervasive public health issues among youth worldwide. Internet gaming reasons or motivations have been studied as a potential predictor of IGA, but the results have been inconsistent and biological indicators of gaming reasons have rarely been studied. We sought to (1) identify categories of internet gaming reasons, (2) examine the relationship of gaming reasons to risk of IGA, and (3) describe biological indicators associated with reasons for gaming. Methods: We used a multi-phase cross-sectional design including individual interviews; focus group discussion; and descriptive, comparative analysis. Fifteen Korean adolescent male internet gamers participated in individual interviews and eight participated in a focus group aimed at identifying reasons for internet gaming. Using the identified gaming reasons from these sources we surveyed 225 adolescent game users using a self-report questionnaire. Participants provided blood samples for assessment of norepinephrine (NE) and serum cortisol. Results: We identified four major categories of internet gaming reasons: entertainment, getting along with friends, stress relief, and habitual gaming. The habitual group showed significantly greater risk of IGA than the other groups (p <.001) and the lowest plasma NE levels (p =.035), possibly indicating an alteration in autonomic function. Conclusion: Health care providers are encouraged to screen adolescents for excessive internet gaming and to intervene with those who report habitual gaming behaviors. When feasible, assessment of biological indicators, such as plasma NE, may help to identify youth at greatest risk of IGA.  © 2020 The Author(s).

IS  - 4
VL  - 18
AB  - This study examined the relations of parent-youth agreement and disagreement during a joint problem-solving task and multi-methodological indices of socioemotional outcomes in adolescents (mean age = 13). One hundred and sixty-seven parents and their adolescent children participated. Each parent-youth pair played the interactive game 'Jenga', and their interactions were analyzed for frequency of elaborations (agreement during three or more conversational turns) and negotiations (disagreement during three or more conversational turns). Elaborations during parent-youth interactions were related to less negative classroom behavior, better self-regulation, and more task persistence in youth. Findings are discussed in light of the importance of parent-youth interaction and youth autonomy in adolescent socioemotional development. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Relative risks of Internet-related addictions and mood disturbances among college students: a 7-country/region comparison
VL  - 165
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to determine the relative risks of addiction to the Internet, online gaming and online social networking of college students in six Asian countries/regions (Singapore, Hong Kong [HK]/Macau, China, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan) compared with students in the United States (US). It also explored the relative risks of depression and anxiety symptoms among students with Internet-related addictions from these countries/regions. Study design: This is a cross-sectional survey. Methods: A convenience sample of 8067 college students aged between 18 and 30 years was recruited from seven countries/regions. Students completed a survey about their use of the Internet, online gaming and online social networking as well as the presence of depression and anxiety symptoms. Results: For all students, the overall prevalence rates were 8.9% for Internet use addiction, 19.0% for online gaming addiction and 33.1% for online social networking addiction. Compared with the US students, Asian students showed higher risks of online social networking addiction but displayed lower risks of online gaming addiction (with the exception of students from HK/Macau). Chinese and Japanese students also showed higher risks of Internet addiction compared with the US students. In general, addicted Asian students were at higher risks of depression than the addicted US students, especially among Asian students who were addicted to online gaming. Addicted Asian students were at lower risks of anxiety than the addicted US students, especially among Asian students who were addicted to online social networking, and addicted students from HK/Macau and Japan were more likely to have higher relative risks of depression. Conclusions: There are country/regional differences in the risks of Internet-related addictions and psychiatric symptoms. It is suggested that country/region-specific health education programmes regarding Internet-related addictions are warranted to maximise the efficiency of prevention and intervention. These programmes should attempt to tackle not only problematic Internet-related behaviours but also mood disturbances among college students. © 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health

IS  - 1
VL  - 32
AB  - Cooperative behavior expressed in the conduct of sharing shows relevant results in the participation of individuals in their social and cultural settings. To account for its efficiency, empiric investigation has shown interest in variables modifying it, as well as changes happening during its development. The present study focuses on information about the reputation of a possible collaborative associate as a modulator and the comparison of its incidence during childhood, puberty, and adolescence. Due to its relevance in socialization of new generations, an interactive virtual setting was presented to participants (metaphor for a videogame) where they would earn resources and could decide to share them with other characters considering information on their reputation. It was found that during childhood, in comparison to puberty, participants share their resources more and consider positive reputation more. Analysis by gender shows that female participants are more sensitive to information on positive and negative reputation at the time of sharing, and that, at the stages of life cycle investigated, behavioral tendency was the informative key to account for reputation © Copyright 2022 by Psykhe

TI  - Research on Prediction of Physical Fitness Test Results in Colleges and Universities Based on Deep Learning
VL  - 2022
AB  - All-round development strategy of quality education makes primary and secondary school students not only pursue the improvement of achievement but also carry out physical exercise. Physical training is the material basis for students to study other disciplines, and the core is to improve students' own physical quality and increase their physique. Having a strong body helps students have certain physical strength to study in other courses. In recent years, in the background of the scientific era, college students in China obviously have some problems, such as insufficient awareness of physical exercise and serious decline in physical fitness. Nowadays, teenagers are addicted to games and go out to become members of the low-headed people. Nowadays, it is very unhealthy for teenagers to go out with their mobile phones as "low-headed people."In order to avoid college students getting rid of this living condition, colleges and universities carry out physical fitness tests every year to promote contemporary college students to strengthen exercise. College students, as the main force in the future construction of the motherland, should not only master professional knowledge but also improve their physical fitness. Good health is the greatest capital in one's life. Every year, some students fail to pass the physical fitness test in universities. It stands to reason that college students are in the age of high youth, and physical fitness test should be a piece of cake for them. In the face of the inconsistency between the predicted results and the actual results, this paper analyzes this. Based on the above situation, With the aim of improving students' training efficiency and physical performance, the physical performance prediction model of deep learning is designed and analyzed to predict the performance, analyze the influencing factors of the model and how to reduce the influencing components of the factors, and analyze and compare the performance of various prediction models to find out the best model, so as to make the predicted value closer to the true value. © 2022 Jiwen Wang et al.

multidimensional construct, response inhibition and impulsive
decision-making are frequently discussed subcomponents. Impulsivity in
sexual offenders could be triggered by sexual cues with high emotional
significance. The present study compared response inhibition abilities
and the degree of impulsive decision-making between 63 child sexual
abusers and 63 nonoffending controls. A Go/No-Go task was used to assess
response inhibition, while the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the Game of
Dice Task (GDT) were used for the assessment of decision-making. In
contrast to previous studies, modified versions of the Go/No-Go task and
the IGT were used, including pictures of the Not Real People-Set
depicting nude adults and children. Child sexual abusers showed more
deficits in response inhibition in the Go/No-Go task. Furthermore,
decision-making was especially impaired by the presence of child images
in child sexual abusers with more intense pedophilic sexual interests.
In contrast, in the nonoffending controls the presence of preferred
sexual cues (pictures of women) improved decision-making performance. No
differences in overall GDT performance were found between the groups;
however, child sexual abusers chose the riskiest option more frequently
than nonoffending controls. In line with theoretical assumptions about
the processes underlying sexual offending, child sexual abusers show
more deficits in neuropsychological functioning, which may be related to
more impulsive behaviors. These impairments could be triggered by the
presence of sexually relevant cues.
General Scientific Summary
The present study suggests that deficits in neuropsychological
functioning lead to more impulsive behaviors, which in turn could be a
significant factor in the etiology of sexual offending. For the first
time it was shown that these neuropsychological deficits could be
provoked by the presence of sexual cues. The findings could provide a
starting point for the development of more advanced treatment regimes by
including behavioral strategies dealing with impulsive behaviors and
dysfunctional decision-making styles.

TI  - Revealing the Intellectual Structure and Evolution of Digital Addiction
Research: An Integrated Bibliometric and Science Mapping Approach
IS  - 22
VL  - 19
AB  - The current study uses ``digital addiction{''} as an umbrella term to
refer to addiction to the Internet, social media, smartphones, digital
devices, video games, or similar digital technologies. The study aims to
investigate the scientific landscape of the digital addiction research
field through combining bibliometric and science mapping analysis and to
facilitate insight into the development and evolution of this knowledge
base. Data for the analysis were extracted from the Scopus database,
which covers a wide range of journal articles, with 429 articles
addressing digital addiction included in the analysis. The science
mapping analysis was performed over three consecutive time periods using
SciMAT software to observe the thematic evolution. The results indicated
that addictive behavior was the most significant theme across the three
time periods. Cross-sectional studies addressing the risk factors or
outcomes of addiction among adults and different sexes were prevalent
during the first period (1997-2012), while interest moved to the
addictive behavior of adolescents and students during the second period
(2013-2017). Research during the third period (2018-2022) was driven by
smartphone and social media addiction, and resilience as a preventive
factor garnered more research interest than previously studied risk
factors, which may indicate a perspective change by researchers.
Implications are suggested for future investigations of digital
addiction.

TI  - Revisiting Empathy Games Concept from User Comments Perspective
AB  - Among the types of games, incipient concepts about empathy games are found in the literature. Empathy is associated with a human ability to put oneself in the other's place, in the case of games, it can be associated with the fact that the player puts himself in the situation/role of the virtual characters. In this context, it is essential to conceptualize and characterize this type of game, to specify the components and the design process in this field. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to understand a concept of empathetic games based on the concept of empathy and the perception of users. The methodology started with a survey of aspects that emerged from the comments of users of four empathic games, grouping them into - technical, emotional, physiological, game theme, and several others. Afterwards, a bibliographic survey was carried out on observable components associated with the concept of empathy, called "expressions of empathy", which could be identified in the users' comments, establishing components involving cognition, affection, behavior and perception. The presence of the aspects raised in the comments containing some expression of empathy signaled a characterization of empathetic games, which was compared with the bibliographical survey on the conceptualization of empathic games arriving at a version of the concept of empathic games described in the form of expressions of empathy. From these results, it is expected to contribute to game developers and designers about the concepts with artifacts and teachings that lead to the construction of a conceptual framework with characteristics of empathy

TI  - Risk factors and psychosocial characteristics of potential problematic and problematic internet use among adolescents: A cross-sectional study
VL  - 11
AB  - Background: Problematic internet use (PIU) is associated with a plethora of psychosocial adversities. The study objectives were to assess the determinants and psychosocial implications associated with potential PIU and PIU among adolescents. Methods. A cross-sectional study design was applied among a random sample (n = 866) of Greek adolescents (mean age: 14.7 years). Self-completed questionnaires, including internet use characteristics, Young Internet Addiction Test, and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, were utilized to examine the study objectives. Results: Among the study population, the prevalence rates of potential PIU and PIU were 19.4% and 1.5%, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression indicated that male gender (Odds Ratio, OR: 2.01; 95% Confidence Interval, 95% CI: 1.35-3.00), as well as utilizing the internet for retrieving sexual information (OR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.53-4.12), interactive game playing (OR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.21-2.82), and socialization, including chat-room use (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.36-2.86) and email (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.05-2.24), were independently associated with potential PIU and PIU. Adolescents with potential PIU had an increased likelihood of concomitantly presenting with hyperactivity (OR: 4.39; 95% CI: 2.03-9.52) and conduct (OR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.46-4.50) problems. Moreover, adolescent PIU was significantly associated with hyperactivity (OR: 9.96; 95% CI: 1.76-56.20) and conduct (OR: 8.39; 95% CI: 2.04-34.56) problems, as well as comprehensive psychosocial maladjustment (OR: 8.08; 95% CI: 1.44-45.34). Conclusions: The determinants of potential PIU and PIU include accessing the internet for the purposes of retrieving sexual information, game playing, and socialization. Furthermore, both potential PIU and PIU are adversely associated with notable behavioral and social maladjustment among adolescents. © 2011 Kormas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Room2Educ8: A Framework for Creating Educational Escape Rooms Based on Design Thinking Principles
IS  - 11
VL  - 12
AB  - By immersing learners in a playful, interactive, and engaging experience, Educational Escape Rooms (EERs) have been found to enhance learners’ motivation, help them to develop 21st century skills, and improve knowledge acquisition. As research into EERs is still in a preliminary phase, no unified framework about how to design them has been established yet. Additionally, existing frameworks rarely validate the quality and efficacy of the frameworks themselves in terms of usability and usefulness. Therefore, the present paper proposes Room2Educ8, a learner-centred framework for EER design that follows Design Thinking principles. It provides detailed heuristics for empathising with learners, defining learning objectives and constraints, adding narrative, designing puzzles, briefing and debriefing participants, prototyping and playtesting, documenting the whole process, and evaluating the EER experience. A mixed-methods internal validation study based on Instructional Design model validation was conducted with 104 postgraduate students between 2018–2022 to assess the framework’s integrity and use. The study findings suggest that Room2Educ8 can be proposed as a valid tool for developing a wide range of EER types that cover a variety of topics. Its well-described and practical steps make it appropriate for educators regardless of a lack of prior experience in EER design. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - School-based prevention of screen-related risk behaviors during the long-term distant schooling caused by COVID-19 outbreak
IS  - 16
VL  - 18
AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak and related restrictions meant a higher incidence of screen-related risk behaviors in both children and adolescents. Our goal was to assess the perceived importance and extent of school-based preventions related to these risks during the long-term, nationwide distant schooling period in the Czech Republic. The online survey was responded to by the school-based prevention specialists (N = 1698). For the analysis, within-subject analysis of variance (ANOVA) and binominal logistic regression were used. At-risk internet use and cyber-bullying were perceived as pressing, but other risks, for example, excessive internet use or the use of cyberpornography, received substantially less priority. The differences in all grades were significant and moderate to large (η2G between 0.156 and 0.288). The proportion of schools which conducted prevention interventions of screen-related risks was low (between 0.7% and 27.8%, depending on the grade and the type of the risk). The probability of delivering prevention intervention was in all grades significantly predicted by the presence of screen-related problems in pupils (OR 3.76–4.88) and the perceived importance of the screen-related risks (OR 1.55–1.97). The limited capacity of schools to deliver prevention interventions during distant schooling as well as the low awareness and impaired ability to recognize the importance of some screen-related risks should be addressed. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - School bullying and group violence: How to occupy a place in the group by exclusion; [Harcèlement scolaire et violence groupale : comment occuper une place dans le groupe par l'exclusion]
VL  - 48
AB  - The prevalence of school bullying (a deliberate, repeated act of verbal, physical or relational/social aggression occurring in a situation of inequality, including cyberbullying) is high in France (10 %) as well as in other countries like the United States (more than 40 % of school children have experienced harassment at some point in their school cursus). This frequency varies by country, source of observation, school, class, and age of children. Self-questionnaires where children have to self-identify as harassing or being harassed involve a clear bias of underevaluation (even for harassed children who can feel ashamed to report explicitly harassment). The method of peer nomination of who, according to each child, has harassed or has been harassed in recent months out of all children in a class, based on mean results, is the most objective method. However, it depends on the participation rate and is not easy to implement, as some professionals consider it to be based on a denunciatory system. The fight against school bullying is a priority with regard to its possible psychological, physical and educational effects on the harassed child/adolescent, but also on the harassing child/adolescent and the spectators. In addition, the consequences of harassment are amplified in our societies by social networks with the use of SMS and Internet on mobile phones and computers. The feeling of being pursued, not only by the harassing youth but also in the eyes of the spectators is no longer limited today to the walls of the school but is also found in other environments where the harassed child/adolescent could previously recuperate from harassement (home, places of extracurricular activity, etc.). Combating school bullying requires breaking the silence and understanding its mechanisms by questioning the roles and functions of all the actors. Bullying appears to be a question of place, a place to show leadership and power but also to gain popularity for the harassing child/adolescent, a place to maintain in the group for the spectators, and a place to defend or to be established for the harassed youth. The presence of spectators, essential to the existence and maintenance of school bullying, distinguishes it from abuse; without spectators, the show cannot take place. There are indeed various actors in harassment, all of them having a major role (roles of stalker, harassed and spectator), and without which the group dynamic could not continue. It opens new perspectives of intervention based on collective responsibility but also individual responsibility, knowing that if only one spectator opposes him/herself to school bullying, harassment can stop. A part focused on each of these protagonists is presented and discussed in this article. However, there is no typology that could be reported here regarding the harassed person, the harassing one or the spectator. A model linking the various protagonists of harassment is presented and proposes that interventions take place simultaneously on these different levels, by focusing on each actor separately but also jointly in the group concerned by school bullying using discussion and role-playing. This work focuses on the ability of cognitive empathy (ability to understand the emotions of others), apparently preserved even in harassing children, and more precisely on the transition from cognitive empathy to emotional empathy (ability to experience the emotions that others feel by putting oneself in their place). If one of the fundamentals of harassment relies on an issue of place, as hypothesized, role-playing and simulation games that consist of “putting oneself in the place of the other” can be powerful mobilizers to combat harassment by allowing a change in points of view, perspectives, positions, relational modalities and behaviors. It is also important to extend interventions to larger groups representing institutions (family, school, society) with their systems of rules and laws that guarantee ethics and protect the individual within institutions. Finally, it is necessary to be aware of the possible risk of antiharassment measures, to create or reinforce an identity of harasser, harassed and/or spectator. For this reason, neither the harassed child/adolescent is designated in this article as “the victim”, nor the harassing child/adolescent as “the author”. The substantives (and not adjectives), the victim and the author, suggest the existence of a permanent identity persisting even outside the context of harassment and defining the individual. Similarly, the proposal of a specialized consultation in psychology and child psychiatry for harassed or harassing children/adolescents does not seem appropriate with regard to this identity issue. This underlines the importance of antibullying interventions to help build spaces for thinking where all individuals can express their feelings and experience the feelings of others, in a secure framework based on human values and clear rules, respected both at an individual and collective level, and supported by fair institutions. © 2022

TI  - Screening Tools for Technological Addictions: A Proposal for the Strategy of Mental Health
IS  - 2
VL  - 15
AB  - The emergence of addictive problems associated with the development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is a challenge for mental health in modern societies. For this reason, the Spanish Mental Health Strategy, currently in project, includes the problem of “emerging addictions” in young people, in the 14 mental health topics to be analysed. The main objective of this research was to develop three screening tools that can be used by health staff (e.g., psychologists, physicians) to better link early detection with early intervention in the field of technological addictions. In this paper, three kind of technological addictions were selected: Internet/social networks, mobile and video games. Two groups of participants were selected for each technology: a) users of Internet/social network, mobile or video games without psychological problems due to the use of these technologies, and b) people who sought counselling or advice for their addictive problems with some of these technologies. Three screening tools for each technological addiction (Internet/social network, mobile and video games) were developed. These tools consist on the two items of each of the tests which have the highest Positive Predictive Values (PPV) to differentiate between the non-problematic users of technologies and those who have an addictive problem with Internet, mobile or video games. This article shows three screening tools that can be used by health or clinical staff, in the case that the professional supposes that the patient has an addictive problem with any of the three technologies. Then, the screening procedure should be implemented. If the diagnostic of addiction is confirmed, the patient should be treated with psychological treatment based in evidence. Some advices are also proposed for those who do not need any specialized intervention for addiction. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Screen-time is associated with inattention problems in preschoolers: Results from the CHILD birth cohort study
IS  - 4
VL  - 14
AB  - Background Pre-school children spend an average of two-hours daily using screens. We examined associations between screen-time on pre-school behavior using data from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study. Methods CHILD participant parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at five-years of age. Parents reported their child’s total screen-time including gaming and mobile devices. Screen-time was categorized using the recommended threshold of two-hours/day for five-years or one-hour/day for three-years. Multiple linear regression examined associations between screen-time and externalizing behavior (e.g. inattention and aggression). Multiple logistic regression identified characteristics of children at risk for clinically significant externalizing problems (CBCL T-score65). Results Screen-time was available for over 95% of children (2,322/2,427) with CBCL data. Mean screen-time was 14 hours/day (95%CI 14, 15) at five-years and 15 hours/day (95%CI: 15, 16) at three-years. Compared to children with less than 30-minutes/day screen-time, those watching more than two-hours/day (137%) had a 22-point increase in externalizing T-score (95%CI: 09, 35, p0001); a five-fold increased odd for reporting clinically significant externalizing problems (95%CI: 10, 250, p = 005); and were 59 times more likely to report clinically significant inattention problems (95%CI: 16, 215, p = 001). Children with a DSM-5 ADHD T-score above the 65 clinical cut-off were considered to have significant ADHD type symptoms (n = 24). Children with more than 2-hours of screen-time/day had a 77-fold increased risk of meeting criteria for ADHD (95%CI: 16, 381, p = 001). There was no significant association between screen-time and aggressive behaviors (p>0.05). Conclusion Increased screen-time in pre-school is associated with worse inattention problems. © 2019 Tamana et al.

TI  - Screen use during food consumption: Does it cause increased food intake? A systematic review
VL  - 171
AB  - Nowadays people use screens, such as mobile phones, television, or tablets, more often during mealtimes, which may have an effect on intake. This review aims to analyze the effect of screen use, during food consumption, on intake. A systematic review was carried out, based on those protocols established by PRISMA. The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases were consulted. Experimental studies, published between 2010 and 2021, that recorded individual intake while using screens such as television, cell phones, or tablets, were selected. A total of 7181 relevant articles were obtained, which were then assessed in accordance with predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 35 studies were included in the complete review: 22 compared different kinds of television content (e.g., adverts), five which compared television versus the absence of screens, four which compared television versus video games, two which compared the use of simultaneous screens, and two studies which included cell phones. A total of 27 studies reported consumption increases related to the presence of advertisements and food signals on screens. No significant differences in intake were reported in the eight studies that reported design or sample size limitations, or lack of control of certain variables. It is thus concluded that screen use during food consumption may increase intake. Education is necessary to regulate the habit of consuming food in the presence of screens. Also, the creation of policies that regulate advertising and food cues on screens are justified and must be accompanied by strategies to monitor compliance. As a limitation, further evidence is necessary in order to determine the effect of mobile phone and tablet use while eating.

TI  - Screen violence and youth behavior
VL  - 140
AB  - Violence in screen entertainment media (ie, television, film, video games, and the Internet), defined as depictions of characters (or players) trying to physically harm other characters (or players), is ubiquitous. The Workgroup on Media Violence and Violent Video Games reviewed numerous meta-analyses and other relevant research from the past 60 years, with an emphasis on violent video game research. Consistent with every major science organization review, the Workgroup found compelling evidence of short-term harmful effects, as well as evidence of long-term harmful effects. The vast majority of laboratory-based experimental studies have revealed that violent media exposure causes increased aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiologic arousal, hostile appraisals, aggressive behavior, and desensitization to violence and decreases prosocial behavior (eg, helping others) and empathy. Still, to more fully understand the potential for long-term harm from media violence exposure, the field is greatly in need of additional large-sample, high-quality, longitudinal studies that include validated measures of media violence exposure and measures of other known violence risk factors. Also, although several high-quality media violence intervention studies have been conducted, larger-scale studies with more comprehensive and longer-term assessments are needed to fully understand long-term effects and to inform the development of tools that will help to reduce problems associated with aggression and violence. The evidence that violent screen media constitutes a causal risk factor for increased aggression is compelling. Modern social-cognitive theories of social behavior provide useful frameworks for understanding how and why these effects occur. Copyright © 2017 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

TI  - Self-concept, self-esteem, gender, race, and information technology use
IS  - 4
VL  - 12
AB  - This research addressed two fundamental questions regarding self-concept, self-esteem, gender, race, and information technology use. First, is technology use related to dimensions of self-concept and/or to self-esteem? Second, are there gender and/or race differences in self-concept, self-esteem, and technology use? Five hundred youth, average age 12 years old, one third African American and two thirds Caucasian American, completed multidimensional measures of self-concept, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale, and measures of frequency of Internet use, Internet use for communication (e-mail and instant messaging), video game playing, and cell phone use. Findings indicated that technology use predicted dimensions of self-concept and self-esteem, with video game playing having a negative influence and Internet use having a positive influence on self-concept dimensions. Gender differences were observed on several self-concept dimensions, but contrary to expectations, girls did not score higher than boys in social self-concept. Only one race difference was observed: African Americans had lower behavioral self-concept than did Caucasian Americans. Implications of the benefits and liabilities of youth's current and projected technology use are discussed. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

TI  - Self-Determination Theory in HCI Games Research: Current Uses and Open Questions
AB  - Self-Determination Theory (SDT), a major psychological theory of human motivation, has become increasingly popular in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research on games and play. However, it remains unclear how SDT has advanced HCI games research, or how HCI games scholars engage with the theory. We reviewed 110 CHI and CHI PLAY papers that cited SDT to gain a better understanding of the ways the theory has contributed to HCI games research. We find that SDT, and in particular, the concepts of need satisfaction and intrinsic motivation, have been widely applied to analyse the player experience and inform game design. Despite the popularity of SDT-based measures, however, prominent core concepts and mini-theories are rarely considered explicitly, and few papers engage with SDT beyond descriptive accounts. We highlight conceptual gaps at the intersection of SDT and HCI games research, and identify opportunities for SDT propositions, concepts, and measures to more productively inform future work.

TI  - Serious Game Design Principles for Children with Autism to Facilitate the Development of Emotion Regulation
IS  - 5
VL  - 14
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a deficit-driven neurodevelopmental condition in three areas, which are social interactions, communication, and the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. Children with autism mainly suffer from emotional disturbance that emerges as meltdowns, tantrums, and aggression, increasing the risk of developing mental health issues. Several studies have assessed the use of serious games in helping children with autism enhance their communication, learning, and social skills. Significantly, these serious games focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the disorder to establish a comfortable and controlled environment that is able to support children with autism. However, there is still a lack of evidence in studies exploring the use of serious games for children with autism to facilitate the development of emotion regulation. The aim of this study is to consolidate and propose a new serious game design principle for children with autism to facilitate the development of emotion regulation. The target age of the children involved in this study ranged between 6 and 12. A review of previous literature on serious game design principles was conducted. More than 70 articles related to serious games for children with autism were analysed using thematic analysis. This study found 16 elements that influenced the designing and developing process of creating a serious game for children with autism. It has been organised and categorised into five attributes (user, game objectives, game elements, game aesthetics, and player experience). Certainly, this study demonstrates the needs and requirements of children with autism when designing serious games. © 2023, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

TI  - Serious Game Platform as a Possibility for Home-Based Telerehabilitation
for Individuals With Cerebral Palsy During COVID-19 Quarantine - A
Cross-Sectional Pilot Study
VL  - 12
AB  - Introduction: There is a need to maintain rehabilitation activities and
motivate movement and physical activity during quarantine in individuals
with Cerebral Palsy (CP).
Objective: This paper sets out to evaluate the feasibility and potential
benefits of using computer serious game in a non-immersive virtual
reality (VR) implemented and evaluated completely remotely in
participants with CP for Home-Based Telerehabilitation during the
quarantine period for COVID-19.
Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, a total of 44 individuals
participated in this study between March and June 2020, 22 of which had
CP (14 males and 8 females, mean age = 19 years, ranging between 11 and
28 years) and 22 typically developing individuals, matched by age and
sex to the individuals with CP. Participants practiced a coincident
timing game(1) and we measured movement performance and physical
activity intensity using the rating of perceived exertion Borg scale.
Results: All participants were able to engage with the VR therapy
remotely, reported enjoying sessions, and improved performance in some
practice moments. The most important result in this cross-sectional
study was the significant increasing in rating of perceived exertion
(through Borg scale) in both groups during practice and with CP
presenting a higher rating of perceived exertion.
Conclusion: Children with CP enjoyed participating, were able to perform
at the same level as their peers on certain activities and increased
both their performance and physical activity intensity when using the
game, supporting the use of serious games for this group for home
therapy and interactive games.

TI  - Sex Ed to Go: A Content Analysis of Comprehensive Sexual Education Apps
IS  - 4
VL  - 45
AB  - Mobile applications (apps) designed for sexual health education have the
potential to reach teens and young adults that are hard to reach through
traditional platforms; however, little is known about availability of
these apps and their adherence to existing guidelines. Following a
search on the two major app stores, data from 2,693 apps were analyzed.
Only 697 (25\%) addressed sexual health, and only 15 (1\%) of apps met
inclusion criteria for comprehensive programs and their content was
further analyzed. The content of most of these apps narrowly focused on
sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy prevention and lacked
information on puberty, sexual identity, and personal safety.
Theoretically grounded strategies including self-efficacy and modeling
behavior to strengthen behavior change efforts were largely absent.
Last, we identified significant shortcomings in the literate design of
these apps, including limited use of interactive features, such as
videos, quizzes, or games. These findings indicate that the potential of
apps as sexual health promotion tools has not yet been fully realized.
We outline recommendations for developing theory- and evidence-based
sexual education apps and provide suggestions for health educators on
how to select relevant apps when working for youth.

TI  - Sharing dark sides on game service platforms: Disruptive behaviors and toxicity in DOTA2 through a platform lens
IS  - 2
VL  - 28
AB  - Toxicity continues to have a strong presence in online environments. This is particularly true for digital entertainment like online games. Toxicity is an important topic as it impacts game development, consumption, popularity, public perception, and player health and well-being. Most of the existing literature on toxicity in gaming is descriptive and exploratory; it often sets out to map milestones and inherent drivers of toxicity. In this article, an alternative perspective is advanced, drawing from a foundation in media and culture studies. Data (streaming online chat, user-generated content, and forum discussions) were collected daily for 4 weeks from Twitch.tv and Steam channels about the popular online game DOTA 2. Results were processed with a content analysis relying on the driving concepts of toxicity and social affordance. The case study and related platforms were selected for their relevance and pertinence with the theme addressed. Findings point to peculiar interactive patterns in framing, supporting, and overturning toxicity and resulting harassment in these extended settings. Implications are noteworthy for scholars and practitioners who intend to shed light on how diffused audiences negotiate toxicity in digital gaming and beyond. © The Author(s) 2021.

TI  - Shopping Around for Loot Box Presence Warning Labels: Unsatisfactory Compliance on Epic, Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft Platforms
IS  - 4
VL  - 1
AB  - Loot boxes are gambling-like products in video games that players can buy with real-world money to obtain random prizes. Many countries are concerned by their potential harms and are considering regulation. Industry self-regulation of companies’ own behavior is an alternative approach to direct government intervention through legislation. The self-regulatory age rating organizations in North America and Europe began assigning a loot box presence warning label (“In-game Purchases (Includes Random Items)”) since April 2020. This consumer protection measure has also been introduced to many digital storefronts. My recent study found that only 29% of popular games containing loot boxes were correctly labeled on the Google Play Store. The age rating organizations have seemingly suggested that other digital storefronts with significantly less content would, in contrast, perform significantly better. The present study found that the compliance rates were indeed higher on the Microsoft (89.1%), Sony (70.3%), and Nintendo (54.2%) stores. However, none met the target 95% compliance rate. Concerningly, the Epic Games Store's compliance rate was only 7.1%. Some remedial actions have been taken following the present study: while appreciated, they have failed to address all outstanding concerns. Companies and platform providers must better comply with and enforce the rules. Besides poor efficacy on mobile platforms, the industry self-regulatory loot box warning label is also not sufficiently reliable on PC and console platforms.

TI  - Simultaneous Infection of Elaphostrongylus Nematode Species and Parasite
Sharing between Sympatrically Occurring Cervids: Moose, Roe Deer, and
Red Deer in Poland
IS  - 10
VL  - 10
AB  - It is important to assess the distribution of parasite species across
wildlife populations, to design strategies for game management and
effective disease control in nature. In this project we quantified the
prevalence of Elaphostrongylus species in eight moose populations. We
used molecular methods for identification of parasite species and host
individual genotypes from fecal samples. We also demonstrated sharing of
parasite species between three cervid hosts sympatrically occurring in
the Biebrza River valley, North-Eastern Poland, which is occupied by the
largest autochthonous, non-harvested moose population in Central Europe.
Nematode species from the genus Elaphostrongylus are ubiquitous in the
studied moose populations. The presence of a single parasite species
(e.g., E. alces) in moose individuals was more common than simultaneous
infection with E. alces and E. cervi. The prevalence of both E. alces
and E. cervi was higher in males than females. The distribution of E.
alces and E. cervi prevalence in moose, roe deer, and red deer were in
accordance with the membership of a host to a subfamily. Simultaneous
occurrences of both Elaphostrongylus species were significantly more
frequently noted in red deer fecal samples than those collected from
moose or roe deer. Thus, we consider red deer to play a dominant role in
sharing of those nematodes to other cervids. Our findings promote
applications of molecular methods of identifying parasite species and
the assessment of the exchange of parasite community between wild
ruminant species in management and health monitoring of game animal
populations.

TI  - Small non-coding satellite RNAs - the `game changers' at the virus-host
plant interaction?
AB  - Satellite RNAs (satRNAs) are RNA molecules associated with many plant
viruses and fully dependent on them for replication, encapsidation, and
movement within the plant or transmission from plant to plant. Their
classification is based on their length, functional protein-coding
capacity, and RNA structure (whether linear or circular). They have been
of interest for a long time as some of them, in particular systems,
cause significant changes in the pathogenesis and epidemiology of plant
viruses. The outcomes of how satRNAs affect pathogenesis depend on the
components of the pathosystem: host plant species or variety, virus
species or even strain, and the sequence of satRNA. These can be
additionally affected by biotic and abiotic factors, for example,
environmental conditions such as the presence of their vectors or
ambient temperature. satRNAs may interfere with primary metabolism,
signalling, plant defence {[}including post-transcriptional gene
silencing (PTGS)], as well as the efficiency of virus transmission from
plant to plant. In recent years, due to wider access to high-throughput
technologies and the extension of studies on satRNAs to include the
involvement of external factors in plant-virus-satRNA systems, we are
gaining a broader view of the consequences of the presence of these
small molecules in viral infections. This review presents the state of
the art of satRNA interactions with the helper virus and host plant as
well as the influence of satRNAs on the insect vector's behaviour.
Moreover, areas requiring further research are identified and knowledge
gaps indicated.

TI  - Smartphone and social network addiction in early adolescents: The role
of self-regulatory self-efficacy in a pilot school-based intervention
IS  - 3
VL  - 96
AB  - Background: Youths' online problematic behaviors, such as smartphone or
social network sites (SNS) addiction, gained increasing attention
nowadays, due to their impact on concurrent and later adjustment, such
as emotional and/or behavioral problems, academic impairments, or
relational issues.Aims: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of
a pilot school-based intervention to contrast online addictive behaviors
while fostering adolescents' self-regulative abilities.Materials \&
Methods: The intervention started in January 2022 in an Italian junior
high school located in Rome, and consisted of four meetings with
students. A total sample of 462 15-year-old adolescents (M-age = 15.2;
SD = 0.50; 41\% females; N-control = 214; N-intervention = 248) was
considered. Within the latent difference score framework, we examined
short-term changes from the pre-to-the-postintervention levels of SNS
and smartphone addiction, and self-regulatory self-efficacy (SRSE)
beliefs as a possible booster of the intervention's
effectiveness.Results: Results showed a significant decrease in both
online addictions (SNS and smartphone addiction), controlling for age,
gender, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status, because of the
short-term efficacy of the project. The buffering effect of SRSE beliefs
was further supported.Conclusion: These findings emphasized the
usefulness of promoting youths' self-regulative beliefs to contrast
problematic tendencies, according to a Positive Youth Development
perspective which focused on resources rather than only on the
prevention of negative outcomes for youths' adjustment.

TI  - Smartphone-Based Virtual and Augmented Reality Implicit Association
Training (VARIAT) for Reducing Implicit Biases Toward Patients Among
Health Care Providers: App Development and Pilot Testing
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: Implicit bias is as prevalent among health care
professionals as among the wider population and is significantly
associated with lower health care quality. Objective: The study goal was
to develop and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of an innovative mobile
app, VARIAT (Virtual and Augmented Reality Implicit Association
Training), to reduce implicit biases among Medicaid providers. Methods:
An interdisciplinary team developed 2 interactive case-based training
modules for Medicaid providers focused on implicit bias related to race
and socioeconomic status (SES) and sexual orientation and gender
identity (SOGI), respectively. The simulations combine experiential
learning, facilitated debriefing, and game-based educational strategies.
Medicaid providers (n=18) participated in this pilot study. Outcomes
were measured on 3 domains: training reactions, affective knowledge, and
skill-based knowledge related to implicit biases in race/SES or SOGI.
Results: Participants reported high relevance of training to their job
for both the race/SES module (mean score 4.75, SD 0.45) and SOGI module
(mean score 4.67, SD 0.50). Significant improvement in skill-based
knowledge for minimizing health disparities for lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and queer patients was found after training (Cohen d=0.72;
95\% CI -1.38 to -0.04). Conclusions: This study developed an innovative
smartphone-based implicit bias training program for Medicaid providers
and conducted a pilot evaluation on the user experience and preliminary
efficacy. Preliminary evidence showed positive satisfaction and
preliminary efficacy of the intervention.

TI  - Smartphone use and addiction during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: cohort study on 184 Italian children and adolescents
IS  - 1
VL  - 47
AB  - Background: The lives of many children and adolescents are today increasingly influenced by new technological devices, including smartphones. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic occurred in a time of outstanding scientific progress and global digitalization. Young people had relevant adverse psychological and behavioral effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly related to infection control measures, which led them to spend more time at home and with major use of technological tools. The goal this study proposes is to evaluate health and social outcomes of smartphone overuse among Italian children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing patterns and aims of utilization, as well as the eventual presence and degree of addiction. Methods: This study was based on a self-report and anonymous questionnaire, which was administered to 184 Italian school-age (6–18 years) children and adolescents during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The test was electronically (email, whatsapp) explained and sent by pediatricians either directly to older children (middle and high school), or indirectly, through the help of teachers, to younger ones (primary school). All participants spontaneously and voluntarily joined the present study. The survey was made by 4 sections, and designed to know and outline modalities (frequency, patterns and aims) of smartphone use, adverse outcomes, and related parental behaviors, also in order to reveal the eventual occurrence and degree of addiction. The same information, related to the pre-epidemic period, was also investigated and analyzed. Results: The data obtained revealed a significantly greater adhesion to the questionnaire by females, likely reflecting higher attention and interest than boys to initiatives relating to health education. Our study showed more frequent smartphone use among Italian children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to the pre-epidemic period. This may be related to the social distancing measures adopted during the months under investigation. The present survey also outlined the changing patterns and aims in the use of smartphones among young people, which allowed to limit some effects of the crisis. Indeed, they were used for human connection, learning and entertainment, providing psychological and social support. Finally, it was observed a significant increase of overuse and addiction. This led to many clinical (sleep, ocular and musculoskeletal disorders), psychological (distraction, mood modification, loss of interest) and social (superficial approach to learning, isolation) unfavorable outcomes. Conclusions: Pediatricians and health care professionals should be aware of the potential risks related to inappropriate use of smartphones. They should monitor, in cooperation with parents, possible associated adverse effects, in order to early recognize signs and symptoms suggestive, or at high risk, for addiction. They must carry out, as well, the necessary interventions to prevent and/or lower the detrimental impact of smartphone overuse on children and adolescents’ health, oriented to sustain adequate physical and psychological development as well as social relationships. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Social and conceptual adaptive skills of individuals with Intellectual Disability; [Habilidades adaptativas sociais e conceituais de indivíduos com deficiência intelectual]
VL  - 53
AB  - Objective: To analyze the social and conceptual skills of people with Intellectual Disability. Method: A descriptive study conducted with 100 caregivers, 9 teachers and 100 people with Intellectual Disability from a Philanthropic Institution in Campina Grande, Paraiba, Brazil. The participants ages in the study ranged from 9 to 83 years. Three-hundred (300) questionnaires were administered. The data were processed by Factorial Matching Analysis in the Tri-Deux-Mots program. Results: Considering the factorial correspondence plan, it should be noted that the social skills of students in the age group between 21 and 40 years were related to playing educational games, playing ball with friends and dating. Regarding conceptual skills, students revealed autonomy in relation to school activities, however the caregivers emphasized that they lack autonomy in relation to these skills. In perceiving the realities of students from different classes, teachers presented opposing opinions on dependency and independence issues. Conclusion: Education and health professionals and caregivers can collaborate more effectively in developing the autonomy of people with Intellectual Disability by promoting a more interactive environment which provides skills development and interpersonal relationships without discrimination, disrespect or prejudice. © 2019 Escola de Enfermagem de Universidade de Sao Paulo.

TI  - Social bonds and exercise: Evidence for a reciprocal relationship
IS  - 8
VL  - 10
AB  - In two experimental studies, we investigated mechanisms hypothesized to underpin two pervasive and interrelated phenomena: that certain forms of group movement and exercise lead to social bonding and that social bonding can lead to enhanced exercise performance. In Study 1, we manipulated synchrony and exercise intensity among rowers and found that, compared with low intensity exercise, moderate intensity exercise led to significantly higher levels of cooperation in an economic game; no effect of synchrony vs. non-synchrony was found. In Study 2, we investigated the effects of bonding on performance, using synchrony as a cue of existing supportive social bonds among participants. An elite, highly bonded team of rugby players participated in solo, synchronized, and non-synchronized warm-up sessions; participants' anaerobic performance significantly improved after the brief synchronous warm-up relative to the non-synchronous warm-up. The findings substantiate claims concerning the reciprocal links between group exercise and social bonding, and may help to explain the ubiquity of collective physical activity across cultural domains as varied as play, ritual, sport, and dance. © 2015 Davis et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

TI  - Social/electronic media use of children and adolescents who attend the pediatric weight management programs of the COMPASS network
IS  - 5
VL  - 11
AB  - Background: Obesity is a major healthcare problem in youth and their social/electronic media (SEM) use has been described as a risk factor. Though much is known about the newer technologies youth use to communicate, little is known about what is used by those in weight management programs. The aim of this study was to determine what types of SEM, including sedentary and active video games, youth in weight management programs use and which they prefer for communicating with healthcare providers. Methods/Design: This was a multisite study using a 24-question online SurveyMonkey® questionnaire. Youth, 12-17 years old, attending pediatric weight management programs at seven participating centers in the Childhood Obesity Multi Program Analysis and Study System network were eligible. Results: There were 292 responders with a mean age of 14.2 years. Fifty-four percent were female, 36% Caucasian, 35% African American, and 33% were Hispanic. Ninety-four percent had access to a computer, 71% had Internet access, and 63% had smartphones. Whereas 87% had at least one gaming system at home, 50% reported they never played sedentary video games (71% of females vs. 25% males; p<0.0001) and 63% never played exercise video games during the week. The preferred method of communication with a heathcare provider was face to face (60%), with few indicating a preference for communication by texting (13%), phone (12%), or social media (6%). Conclusions: Face-to-face communication with healthcare providers is the preferred method for youth in pediatric weight management programs. They self-reported video game use less than previously described. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

TI  - Social epidemiology of early adolescent problematic screen use in the
United States
IS  - 5
VL  - 92
AB  - Objective To determine sociodemographic correlates of problematic screen
use (social media, video games, mobile phones) among a
racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population-based
sample of 10-14-year-old early adolescents. Study design We analyzed
cross-sectional data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development
Study (Year 2, 2018-2020; N = 8753). Multiple linear regression analyses
were used to estimate associations between sociodemographic factors
(age, sex, race/ethnicity, primary language, household income, parental
education) and adolescent-reported problematic video game (Video Game
Addiction Questionnaire), social media (Social Media Addiction
Questionnaire), and mobile phone use (Mobile Phone Involvement
Questionnaire). Results Boys reported higher problematic video game use
while girls reported higher problematic social media and mobile phone
use. Native American, black, and Latinx adolescents reported higher
scores across all problematic screen measures compared to non-Latinx
white adolescents. Having unmarried/unpartnered parents was associated
with higher problematic social media use. Although higher household
income was generally protective against problematic video game use,
these associations were weaker for black than white adolescents (p for
interaction <0.05). Conclusions Given the sociodemographic differences
in problematic screen use, digital literacy education strategies can
focus on at-risk populations, encourage targeted counseling by
pediatricians, and adapt family media use plans for diverse backgrounds.
Impact While sociodemographic differences in screen time are documented,
we examined sociodemographic differences in problematic screen use in a
large, diverse sample of early adolescents in the US. Boys reported
higher problematic video game use while girls reported higher
problematic social media and mobile phone use. Native American, black,
and Latinx adolescents reported higher scores across all problematic
screen measures compared to non-Latinx white adolescents. Although
higher household income was generally protective against problematic
video game use, these associations were weaker for black than white
adolescents. Beyond time spent on screens, pediatricians, parents, and
educators should be aware of sociodemographic differences in problematic
screen use.

IS  - 6
VL  - 19
AB  - Background: In 2015, 90% of US young adults with Internet access used social media. Digital and social media are highly prevalent modalities through which young adults explore identity formation, and by extension, learn and transmit norms about health and risk behaviors during this developmental life stage. Objective: The purpose of this study was to provide updated estimates of social media use from 2014 to 2016 and correlates of social media use and access to digital technology in data collected from a national sample of US young adults in 2016. Methods: Young adult participants aged 18-24 years in Wave 7 (October 2014, N=1259) and Wave 9 (February 2016, N=989) of the Truth Initiative Young Adult Cohort Study were asked about use frequency for 11 social media sites and access to digital devices, in addition to sociodemographic characteristics. Regular use was defined as using a given social media site at least weekly. Weighted analyses estimated the prevalence of use of each social media site, overlap between regular use of specific sites, and correlates of using a greater number of social media sites regularly. Bivariate analyses identified sociodemographic correlates of access to specific digital devices. Results: In 2014, 89.42% (weighted n, 1126/1298) of young adults reported regular use of at least one social media site. This increased to 97.5% (weighted n, 965/989) of young adults in 2016. Among regular users of social media sites in 2016, the top five sites were Tumblr (85.5%), Vine (84.7%), Snapchat (81.7%), Instagram (80.7%), and LinkedIn (78.9%). Respondents reported regularly using an average of 7.6 social media sites, with 85% using 6 or more sites regularly. Overall, 87% of young adults reported access or use of a smartphone with Internet access, 74% a desktop or laptop computer with Internet access, 41% a tablet with Internet access, 29% a smart TV or video game console with Internet access, 11% a cell phone without Internet access, and 3% none of these. Access to all digital devices with Internet was lower in those reporting a lower subjective financial situation; there were also significant differences in access to specific digital devices with Internet by race, ethnicity, and education. Conclusions: The high mean number of social media sites used regularly and the substantial overlap in use of multiple social media sites reflect the rapidly changing social media environment. Mobile devices are a primary channel for social media, and our study highlights disparities in access to digital technologies with Internet access among US young adults by race/ethnicity, education, and subjective financial status. Findings from this study may guide the development and implementation of future health interventions for young adults delivered via the Internet or social media sites.

TI  - Social preferences under chronic stress
IS  - 7
VL  - 13
AB  - Even though chronic stress is a pervasive problem in contemporary societies and is known to potentially precede both adverse psychological as well as physiological conditions, its effects on decision making have not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we focus on the relation between self-reported chronic stress and self-reported as well as behaviorally shown social preferences. We measured chronic stress with the Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress. To determine social preferences, participants played a double anonymous dictator game. In order to control for the robustness of social preferences we employed a 2x2x2x2 design where we manipulated four variables: the frame (Give to Recipient vs. Take from Recipient), the decision maker’s gender (Female vs. Male), the recipient’s gender (Female vs. Male), and the nature of the reward (Real vs. Hypothetical). Results show that perceived chronic stress is not significantly related to social preferences in monetarily rewarded dictator decisions for either gender. However, women’s displayed preferences for hypothetical rewards are negatively correlated to chronic stress levels. This indicates that higher chronic stress in women is associated with lower hypothetical transfers but not with altered actual behavior as compared to non-stressed women. For men, we do not observe such effects. Our findings suggest that, while chronic stress leaves social preferences unaffected in an incentive compatible task, it might foster what could be interpreted as a decrease in self-image promotion in women. Thus, we conclude that in a thoroughly controlled behavioral task differences in reported chronic stress do not entail differences in social preferences, but relate to variation in hypothetical decisions for women. © 2018 Ceccato et al.

TI  - Social support, depressive symptoms, and online gaming network communication
IS  - 1
VL  - 24
AB  - Purpose: The increase of videogame use has raised concerns regarding mental health of gamers (e.g. social isolation, depression); however, online gaming may offer the benefit of social connectivity. Many games provide ways for people to meet and interact, providing social opportunities difficult to come by for some young adults. One way to investigate social connection is through social network analysis, which explores the influence of connections on behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to analyze factors related to social connections within an online gaming community, with an emphasis on the influence of social support and depressive symptoms on network ties. Design/methodology/approach: All members of an online gaming site were asked to report demographics, site use, depressive symptoms, “in-real-life” (IRL) social support, and online social support. Members were also asked to nominate those in their gaming network with whom they spoke to about important life matters. Moran’s I determined the spatial autocorrelation of depressive symptoms and IRL support within the network. Exponential random graph modeling determined factors significantly associated with tie presence between members. Findings: Members (n=37) were significantly more likely to speak to other members about important life matters if they reported more site hours, more depressive symptoms, and less IRL support. Depressive symptoms and IRL support were not significantly spatially autocorrelated within this network. Originality/value: Results suggest members may be filling an IRL social support deficit with friends they have met online. Additionally, members who reported more depressive symptoms may be seeking help from informal online connections through online gaming. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Space For Children: improving mastery and reducing negative emotions
about COVID-19 in youth via mobile interactive storytelling
AB  - A BST R A C T BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a complex event
for children and adolescents, significantly impacting their daily
activities. In this scenario, our study aims at verifying if ``Space for
Children,{''} an ad -hoc developed game based on interactive
storytelling about the pandemic, can increase mastery and reduces
negative emotions about COVID-19. METHODS: The app Space for Children
has been sponsored and spread online by email and social media platforms
for a limited time period (from May 2021 to January 2022). Before and
after the interactive storytelling, participants answered two
questionnaires containing a couple of critical questions regarding their
emotional state and their perceived mastery about COVID-19. RESULTS: Two
hundred thirty-six participants (M=116; F=120) between 7 and 12 years
old completed the Space for Children interactive experience. Our results
show a significant effect of the game experience on emotional state and
perceived mastery regarding COVID-19. Indeed, before the interactive
storytelling unpleasant emotional states prevail (reported by 77\% of
participants) while after the game a clear prevalence of pleasant
emotions emerges (reported by 68\% of participants). Regarding perceived
mastery, results show that self -reported very expert participants
passed from 49\% to 88\%. All the results hold irrespective of age group
and sex. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents preliminary findings that
highlight the potential benefits of utilizing new technologies based on
Interactive Storytelling for Children to effectively convey age
-appropriate information about complex reallife events, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic, while also mitigating associated negative emotional
responses.

TI  - Specific Types of Screen-Based Sedentary Time and Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents
IS  - 4
VL  - 24
AB  - Purpose: Screen-based sedentary behavior (SSB) has been identified as risk factor for mental disorders in most oadolescents. However, there is little literature pertaining to the specific kinds of SSB and its connections witdepressive symptoms in most of adolescents. In the present study, we are going to find out the connectionbetween specific types of SSB and depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional datbased on 996 study participants of middle school students in Guangdong Province. SSB was evaluated by distrbuting the questionnaire of Health Behavior in School-aged Children, while depressive symptoms were evaluateusing Chinese version of Children’s Depressive symptoms Inventory (CDI). SSB was categorized into TV/movitime, video games time and other electronic devices-based time (e.g., mobile phone, computer use). Generalizelinear models was used to explore the connections between specific kinds of SSB and depressive symptomResults: After controlling for variables of sex, ethnicity, grade, residence, siblings, perceived family affluencfather educational level, mother educational background, body mass index (BMI), physical exercise, duratioof sleep, other electronic devices-based time was positively correlated with depressive symptoms in Chinesadolescents (B = 0.557%, 95%CI: 0.187–0.926, p = 0.003). This significant connection was also found in gir(B = 0.728%, 95%CI: 0.230–1.225, p = 0.004) instead of boys (p > 0.05). The other types of SSB were not significantly in relation to depressive symptoms in adolescents regardless of sex. Conclusion: This study suggested thait might be effective in reducing or preventing depressive symptoms through limiting electronic devices-basetime, like computer use or mobile phone use time. This strategy would be particularly useful in girls. Future studies should negate or replicate the research results by introducing more improved study design, which is beneficito better understand the connections between SSB and depressive symptoms as well as then design more efficieninterventions in adolescents. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

TI  - STARBRIGHT World: Effects of an electronic network on the social environment of children with life-threatening illnesses
IS  - 1
VL  - 31
AB  - STARBRIGHT World (SBW) is a virtual environment designed to link seriously ill children into an interactive online community in which they can play games, learn about their medical condition, or talk with other chronically ill children. This study evaluated the impact of SBW on pain, mood, anger, loneliness, problem behavior, and willingness to return for treatment of children receiving outpatient treatment at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). To test the hypothesis that SBW provides benefit through distraction, a restricted alternating treatments design was utilized to measure anger, pain, and mood. To test the more long-term benefits of SBW, loneliness and problem behavior were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Willingness to return was measured at each hospital visit made during the study. Process information was also collected during each SBW session (e.g., ease of use, frustration, and general enjoyment of the system). Thirty-two children participating in pediatric clinical trials at the NIH and their caregivers participated in the study. Seventy-eight percent of participants, ages 8 to 19 years, were HIV infected and the remaining 22% had varied, but potentially life-threatening, illnesses. Children reported significantly less loneliness and were significantly more willing to return to the hospital for treatment from baseline to follow-up. They were marginally less worried after using SBW than after using the regular playroom. Parents reported that their children experienced significantly less withdrawn behavior and needed significantly less help with both anxiety and resistance in returning to the hospital for treatment after using SBW. They also reported that SBW helped their children to feel decreases in loneliness and depressed mood, and increases in energetic mood. SBW is a potentially useful tool to improve the hospital experience for seriously ill children, reduce their feelings of loneliness and isolation, and help them to be less socially withdrawn.

TI  - StoryCoder: Teaching Computational Thinking Concepts Through Storytelling in a Voice-Guided App for Children
AB  - Computational thinking (CT) education reaches only a fraction of young children, in part because CT learning tools often require expensive hardware or fluent literacy. Informed by needfinding interviews, we developed a voice-guided smartphone application leveraging storytelling as a creative activity by which to teach CT concepts to 5- to 8-year-old children. The app includes two storytelling games where users create and listen to stories as well as four CT games where users then modify those stories to learn about sequences, loops, events, and variables. We improved upon the app design through wizard-of-oz testing (N = 28) and iterative design testing (N = 22) before conducting an evaluation study (N = 22). Children were successfully able to navigate the app, effectively learn about the target computing concepts, and, after using the app, children demonstrated above-chance performance on a near transfer CT concept recognition task.

TI  - Study protocol for an individually randomized control trial for India's first roleplay-based mobile game for reproductive health for adolescent girls
IS  - 1
VL  - 20
AB  - Background: Go Nisha Go™ (GNG), is a mobile game combining behavioural science, human-centric design, game-based learning, and interactive storytelling. The model uses a direct-to-consumer (DTC) approach to deliver information, products, services, interactive learning, and agency-building experiences directly to girls. The game’s five episodes focus on issues of menstrual health management, fertility awareness, consent, contraception, and negotiation for delay of marriage and career. The game’s effectiveness on indicators linked to these issues will be measured using an encouragement design in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: A two-arm RCT will be conducted in three cities in India: Patna, Jaipur, and Delhi-NCR. The first arm is the treatment (encouragement) arm (n = 975) where the participants will be encouraged to download and play the game, and the second arm (n = 975) where the participants will not receive any nudges/encouragement to play the game. They may or may not have access to the game. After the baseline recruitment, participants will be randomly assigned to these two arms across the three locations. Participants of the treatment/encouragement arm will receive continuous support as part of the encouragement design to adopt, install the game from the Google Play Store at no cost, and play all levels on their Android devices. The encouragement activity will continue for ten weeks, during which participants will receive creative messages via weekly phone calls and WhatsApp messages. We will conduct the follow-up survey with all the participants (n = 1950) from the baseline survey after ten weeks of exposure. We will conduct 60 in-depth qualitative interviews (20 at each location) with a sub-sample of the participants from the encouragement arm to augment the quantitative surveys. Discussion: Following pre-testing of survey tools for feasibility of methodologies, we will recruit participants, randomize, collect baseline data, execute the encouragement design, and conduct the follow-up survey with eligible adolescents as written in the study protocol. Our study will add insights for the implementation of an encouragement design in RCTs with adolescent girls in the spectrum of game-based learning on sexual and reproductive health in India. Our study will provide evidence to support the outcome evaluation of the digital mobile game app, GNG. To our knowledge this is the first ever outcome evaluation study for a game-based application, and this study is expected to facilitate scalability of a direct-to-consumer approach to improve adolescent sexual and reproductive health outcomes in India.

TI  - Superbugs online: co-production of an educational website to increase
public understanding of the microbial world in, on, and around us
VL  - 15
AB  - Digital tools and online presence have become a cornerstone in public
engagement and involvement strategy and delivery. We here describe the
co-production process behind launching a new multilingual resource for
schools in the United Kingdom and beyond, jointly between university
scientists, engagement professionals, primary and secondary teachers,
and web designers. The `Superbugs' website aims at raising awareness and
increasing the public understanding of the microbial world in, on, and
around us-with a focus on infection, hygiene, and antimicrobial
resistance-and attracted >19,000 online visitors, >33,500 page views,
and > 775,000 Twitter impressions over the past 24 months.
Superbugs.online is available in English, Welsh, Irish, and Scottish
Gaelic, thus making it accessible to everyone in the United Kingdom and

TI  - Suspecting Sarcasm: How League of Legends Players Dismiss Positive Communication in Toxic Environments
IS  - CHI PLAY
VL  - 7
AB  - Toxicity in multiplayer gaming is an ongoing problem that threatens the well-being of players, gaming communities, and game developers. Meanwhile, interventions that promote positive interactions and proactively create positive gaming spaces are still in their infancy; little is known about how players respond to positivity.  
In our study, 959 League of Legends players were presented with either 10 positive chat logs or 10 negative chat logs, and asked to reflect on the content and how representative such communication is of their own gaming experiences. We thematically coded participants' free-form answers (identifying the themes normalize, acknowledge, downplay, cope, blame, and make personal), and compared the positive and negative conditions in terms of theme prevalence. Our findings show that participants were more likely to normalize and acknowledge toxic negativity than positivity. Furthermore, the dominant response to positivity consisted of downplaying messages as not representative and rare, and even expressing suspicion that messages must have been fabricated or intended as sarcasm. Participants overwhelmingly cope by muting chat, protecting them from toxic interactions, but leaving them unexposed to positive communication and other beneficial social interactions within play.

TI  - Synthesizing guidelines for facilitating elderly-smartphone interaction
AB  - Nowadays, using mobile and communication technologies helps the elderly population to stay active by promoting social interactions and independence in many daily tasks, such as paying their bills. Therefore, we can identify many efforts for the digital inclusion of the elderly. However, just offering access to the new technologies, such as touch-based smartphones and tablets, is not enough to ensure effective digital inclusion. Developers need to design apps that consider the inherent losses of the aging process, in order to create more accessible computational solutions. As developers of apps for the elderly population, we struggle to provide a good User Experience for these users. We carried out a literature review to identify guidelines for the design of inclusive interfaces, however, literature guidelines are divergent in some cases, especially in aspects related to touch interaction. To clarify some of these differences, we conducted a case study with elderly to analyze their touch interaction with mobile devices. Twelve seniors interacted with a mobile digital game developed to evaluate touch-based interactions. We recorded and analyzed their in-game touch performance data. Preliminary observations indicated the difficulties of these elders in the interaction characterized by drag and drop and pinch gestures. As result, a list of guidelines resulting from the literature and the study is proposed.

TI  - Systematic evaluation of mobile fitness apps: Apps as the Tutor, Recorder, Game Companion, and Cheerleader
VL  - 59
AB  - Mobile fitness applications are innovating the ways in which smartphone users self-manage their health. Prior research found that app functions may impact app efficacy. However, research to date has not sought to systematically investigate how different combinations of app functions impact user response to apps, especially adoption intent. This article describes two studies on mobile fitness app characteristics and user attitudes. Study One used content analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis on 98 iPhone fitness apps and identified four app clusters: “Tutor”, “Recorder”, “Game Companion”, and “Cheerleader.” Tracking was the predominant function in current market, but tracking-focused Recorder apps received lowest user ratings among all app clusters. Users favored Tutor apps that combine exercise education and tracking, and Game Companion apps that combine gamification, tracking, and social functions. Function combinations, rather than standalone functions, impact app success. Following a Reasoned Action Approach, Study Two found various effects of individual differences (age, gender, BMI, eHealth literacy, smartphone experience, function preference) on user attitude toward different fitness app types. A comparison between two studies demonstrated a mismatch between market offerings and user needs regarding app functions. Implications of results for mobile fitness app design to improve consumer health and for theories are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Tackling sensitive issues using a gamebased environment: Serious game for relationships and sex education (RSE)
VL  - 10
AB  - Experiencing sexual coercion during adolescence can lead to adverse psychological and physical health outcomes for those affected. Eliminatingsuch experiences is important for enhancingadolescent wellbeing, and the provision of good quality relationships and sex education (RSE) is needed. Engaging young people in sensitive subjectmatters in RSE can be challenging, and using Serious Gaming technology may support young people and educators in this process. This paper describes the use of Intervention mapping (IM) in the development of a serious game on the topic of sexual coercion for use in RSE. IM is a process that draws on stakeholder engagement and the theory and evidence base to support health improvement intervention planning. Serious game developers transformed the game concept ‘flat plan’ into an interactive gameshow. The game is teacher ledand aims to engage students in gameplay and discussion around the issue of sexual coercion. The final product known as PR:EPARe (Positive Relationships: Eliminating Coercion and Pressure in Adolescent Relationships) is the subject of an ongoing cluster Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) in local schools. Early data analysis shows improvements in psychological preparedness for dealing with sexual coercion against some change objectives. This work represents the first attempt to use IM in the development of a Serious Game and the use of Serious Gaming for RSE delivery. RCT work is ongoing and PR:EPARe will become part of local RSE delivery in the new school year. Plans for ensuring broader impact of the game are in development. © 2012 Interactive Media Institute.

TI  - "Talking without a Voice": Understanding Non-verbal Communication in Social Virtual Reality
IS  - CSCW2
VL  - 4
AB  - Exploring communication dynamics in digital social spaces such as massively multiplayer online games and 2D/3D virtual worlds has been a long standing concern in HCI and CSCW. As online social spaces evolve towards more natural embodied interaction, it is important to explore how non-verbal communication can be supported in more nuanced ways in these spaces and introduce new social interaction consequences. In this paper we especially focus on understanding novel non-verbal communication in social virtual reality (VR). We report findings of two empirical studies. Study 1 collected observational data to explore the types of non-verbal interactions being used naturally in social VR. Study 2 was an interview study (N=30) that investigated people's perceptions of non-verbal communication in social VR as well as the resulting interaction outcomes. This study helps address the limitations in prior literature on non-verbal communication dynamics in online social spaces. Our findings on what makes non-verbal communication in social VR unique and socially desirable extend our current understandings of the role of non-verbal communication in social interaction. We also highlight potential design implications that aim at better supporting non-verbal communication in social VR.

TI  - Teaching adequate prehospital use of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic: Development of a gamified e-learning module
IS  - 2
VL  - 8
AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Adequate use of this equipment is more critical than ever because the risk of shortages must be balanced against the need to effectively protect health care workers, including prehospital personnel. Specific training is therefore necessary; however, the need for social distancing has markedly disrupted the delivery of continuing education courses. Electronic learning (e-learning) may provide significant advantages because it requires neither the physical presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. Objective: Inclusion of game mechanics, or “gamification,” has been shown to increase knowledge and skill acquisition. The objective of this research was to develop a gamified e-learning module to interactively deliver concepts and information regarding the correct choice and handling of PPE. Methods: The SERES framework was used to define and describe the development process, including scientific and design foundations. After we defined the target audience and learning objectives by interviewing the stakeholders, we searched the scientific literature to establish relevant theoretical bases. The learning contents were validated by infection control and prehospital experts. Learning mechanics were then determined according to the learning objectives, and the content that could benefit from the inclusion of game mechanics was identified. Results: The literature search resulted in the selection and inclusion of 12 articles. In addition to gamification, pretesting, feedback, avoiding content skipping, and demonstrations using embedded videos were used as learning mechanics. Gamification was used to enhance the interactivity of the PPE donning and doffing sequences, which presented the greatest learning challenges. The module was developed with Articulate Storyline 3 to ensure that it would be compatible with a wide array of devices, as this software generates HTML5-compatible output that can be accessed on smartphones, tablets, and regular computers as long as a recent browser is available. Conclusions: A gamified e-learning module designed to promote better knowledge and understanding of PPE use among prehospital health care workers was created by following the SERES framework. The impact of this module should now be assessed by means of a randomized controlled trial. © 2020 JMIR Publications. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Teaching an old dog new tricks: A lipid membrane-based electric immunosensor for real-time probing of the spike S1 protein subunit from SARS-CoV-2
IS  - 5-6
VL  - 22
AB  - Fast, cheap, and easy to implement point-of-care testing for various pathogens constituted a game changer in past years due to its potential for early disease diagnosis. Herein, we report on the proof-of-concept of a simple method enabling in vitro detection of a structural spike protein subunit from the SARS-CoV-2 (S1) in aqueous samples. At the core of this discovery lies the well-known paradigm of monitoring the capacitive current across a reconstituted zwitterionic lipid membrane subjected to a periodic transmembrane potential, followed by the real-time spectral analysis enabling the extraction of the second harmonic of the capacitive current. Subsequent changes in the amplitude of this harmonic recorded during lipid membrane–S1 interactions were correlated with alterations induced in the inner membrane potential profile by the S1 protein subunit adsorption, and were shown to be augmented by ionic strength, the presence of a specific monoclonal antibody designed against the S1 subunit and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein receptor, and uninhibited by the presence of other human serum proteins. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

TI  - Telling your own story: design and evaluation of a storytelling mechanic in a platform for serious games authoring
AB  - End-User Development (EUD) researchers have been investigating methods and techniques so that, instead of computer experts, end users build applications themselves. However, these users have difficulties, for example, in understanding requirements, in making design decisions, in making use and reuse of components, and in carrying out integration and testing activities --- barriers to be overcome in the area. This paper presents the design, development and evaluation process of a storytelling-type game mechanic created to compose a platform for authoring digital games in which professionals can create their own games and use them with their populations of interest. The design was created together with professionals from different areas, in different stages, in order to consider a holistic view. The evaluation was carried out through usability tests that pointed out improvements to enable a more intuitive and easy-to-use interface. The storytelling game is an extra resource for health and education professionals, for example, to use as pedagogical or therapy tools.

TI  - Testing the Efficacy of a Social Networking Gamification App to Improve Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Adherence (P3: Prepared, Protected, emPowered): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial
IS  - 12
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: HIV prevalence is high among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women who have sex with men (YTWSM), particularly among minorities. Despite its proven efficacy and safety, the uptake of and adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among YMSM and YTWSM is currently limited. To date, evidence-based interventions to promote and sustain PrEP adherence have been limited and not shown to be highly efficacious. Given the widespread adoption of smartphones, mobile apps can be utilized to increase PrEP adherence for many YMSM and YTWSM. Objective: The study consists of a formative research phase to develop an app-based intervention, P3 (Prepared, Protected, emPowered), to increase PrEP adherence, and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test its efficacy. P3 is a mobile app built on an established health platform, which includes social networking and game-based components to encourage PrEP adherence among YMSM and YTWSM. P3+ includes all P3 features plus adherence counseling delivered via two-way text messaging (short message service, SMS) through the app. Methods: The formative research phase includes usability testing to assess users’ comprehension of P3’s educational content, understanding and use of intervention features, and overall impressions of app functionality, followed by app refinements. A subsequent field trial will identify and resolve any remaining technical challenges. A three-arm RCT (P3, P3+, and standard of care) will then be conducted at 6 iTech subject recruitment venues to assess intervention efficacy and to conduct a comparison of costs to deliver the 2 intervention arms. Results: This is an ongoing research project with initial results from the formative work expected in 2020 and those from the RCT in 2021. Conclusions: P3 aims to provide an engaging, interactive experience that is highly appealing for the target population, leveraging technology already heavily integrated into the lives of young people, and thus meeting users’ needs in a familiar, stimulating way. If efficacious, P3 could be a sustainable, easily disseminated, lower-cost PrEP intervention for YMSM and YTWSM. Further, the research aims to determine the processes that are essential to developing and implementing future health-related gamification interventions. ©Sara LeGrand, Kelly Knudtson, David Benkeser, Kathryn Muessig, Andrew Mcgee, Patrick S Sullivan, Lisa Hightow-Weidman.

TI  - The association of screen time, television in the bedroom, and obesity among school-aged youth: 2007 national survey of children's health
IS  - 8
VL  - 83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among school-aged youth, we sought to identify characteristics associated with (1) exceeding screen time recommendations (ie, television/videos/video games more than 2 hours/weekday), and (2) exceeding screen time recommendations, the presence of a television in the bedroom, and obesity. METHODS: Using 2007 National Survey of Children's Health data, we used multivariable logistic regression to identify sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics associated with excessive screen time among 6 to 11- and 12 to 17-year-olds on a typical weekday. For 12 to 17-year-olds only, we used logistic regression to examine the odds of obesity using the same variables as above, with the addition of screen time. RESULTS: Overall, 20.8% of 6 to 11-year-olds and 26.1% of 12 to 17-year-olds had excessive screen time. For both age groups, having a bedroom TV was significantly associated with excessive screen time. For the older age group, the dual scenario of excessive screen time with a bedroom TV had the strongest association with obesity (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.9, 3.2). CONCLUSIONS: Given the similar risk factors for excess screen time and having a TV in the bedroom, a public health challenge exists to design interventions to reduce screen time among school-aged youth.

TI  - The Caixa de Pandora Game: Changing Behaviors and Attitudes toward Violence against Women
IS  - 3
VL  - 16
AB  - This article presents the development issues and evaluation results of a serious game called Caixa de Pandora (Pandora's Box, in English), developed to train health professionals to care for women in situations of domestic violence. The combat of violence against women in the health sector presupposes a change of attitudes with respect to identified cases, with the exclusion of discriminatory and oppressive practices on the part of care professionals. To change these behaviors and verify postures, Caixa de Pandora uses an approach focused on the affective domain of learning. In the same sense of verifying and guiding changes in behavior, the intelligence module of the game used a model based on psychometric principles in its design. The validation of the game by a statistical sample with health professionals identified changes in their conceptions about the subject after playing the game, thereby demonstrating its pedagogical potential to formulate new knowledge and to change behavior.

TI  - The design and implementation of a randomized controlled trial of a risk reduction and human immunodeficiency virus prevention videogame intervention in minority adolescents: PlayForward: Elm City Stories
IS  - 4
VL  - 13
AB  - Background: To address the need for risk behavior reduction and human immunodeficiency virus prevention interventions that capture adolescents "where they live," we created a tablet-based videogame to teach skills and knowledge and influence psychosocial antecedents for decreasing risk and preventing human immunodeficiency virus infection in minority youth in schools, after-school programs, and summer camps. Methods: We developed PlayForward: Elm City Stories over a 2-year period, working with researchers, commercial game designers, and staff and teens from community programs. The videogame PlayForward provides an interactive world where players, using an avatar, "travel" through time, facing challenges such as peer pressure to drink alcohol or engage in risky sexual behaviors. Players experience how their choices affect their future and then are able to go back in time and change their choices, creating different outcomes. A randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of PlayForward. Participants were randomly assigned to play PlayForward or a set of attention/time control games on a tablet at their community-based program. Assessment data were collected during face-to-face study visits and entered into a web-based platform and unique real-time "in-game" PlayForward data were collected as players engaged in the game. The innovative methods of this randomized controlled trial are described. We highlight the logistical issues of conducting a large-scale trial using mobile technology such as the iPad®, and collecting, transferring, and storing large amounts of in-game data. We outline the methods used to analyze the in-game data alone and in conjunction with standardized assessment data to establish correlations between behaviors during gameplay and those reported in real life. We also describe the use of the in-game data as a measure of fidelity to the intervention. Results: In total, 333 boys and girls, aged 11-14 years, were randomized over a 14-month period: 166 were assigned to play PlayForward and 167 to play the control games. To date (as of 1 March 2016), 18 have withdrawn from the study; the following have completed the protocol-defined assessments: 6 weeks: 271 (83%), 3 months: 269 (84%), 6 months: 254 (79%), 12 months: 259 (82%), and 24 months: is ongoing with 152 having completed out of the 199 participants (76%) who were eligible to date (assessment windows were still open). Conclusion: Videogames can be developed to address complex behaviors and can be subject to empiric testing using community-based randomized controlled trials. Although mobile technologies pose challenges in their use as interventions and in the collection and storage of data they produce, they provide unique opportunities as new sources of potentially valid data and novel methods to measure the fidelity of digitally delivered behavioral interventions. © The Author(s) 2016.

TI  - The Development and piloting of an eHealth breastfeeding resource targeting fathers and partners as co-parents
VL  - 50
AB  - Objective Traditionally breastfeeding education programs target mothers solely. The objective of this study was to design and pilot test an interactive eHealth breastfeeding co-parenting resource developed to target both mothers and fathers. eHealth resources provide an accessible and engaging format on which to educate parents and assist them in meeting their breastfeeding goals. Best practices to design such resources are not currently known. Design A three phase pilot study was conducted. The three phases included conducting a needs assessment, creating the resource and pilot testing the resource with mother, father and health care professionals to determine their perspectives regarding the usability and design of the prototype resource. The interactive prototype resource was designed to provide information to parents on breastfeeding and co-parenting, which included suggestions on how fathers can be involved and support breastfeeding and how the couples can work as a team to meet their breastfeeding goals. Setting: Recruitment took place in a health region in Southern Ontario, Canada between June 2014 and March 2015. Online questionnaires were completed by participants in all phases of the study.Participants: Participants (n=149) were pregnant or new mothers and their partners in the health region who read and speak English and had access to the internet and health care professionals who work with breastfeeding families in Ontario, Canada. Intervention A prototype eHealth breastfeeding co-parenting resource was developed based on maternal and paternal feedback from Phase I and utilized an interactive interface which included games and multimodal information delivery. The prototype eHealth resource was provided to the parents in Phase II and health care professionals in Phase III. The final resource was created based on feedback from these participants. Measurements and Findings The resource was pilot tested with new and expectant parents using pre- and post-test questionnaires which included measures for breastfeeding self-efficacy (Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Short Form), infant feeding attitude (Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale), breastfeeding knowledge (Breastfeeding Knowledge Questionnaire) and co-parenting relationship (Co-parenting Relationship Scale). Maternal and paternal breastfeeding self-efficacy and knowledge and infant feeding attitude scores all increased from pre-test to post-test. However, there was no difference in the co-parenting relationship scores from pretest to post-test. Key Conclusions This study has used feedback from parents and health professionals to develop a prototype resource which appears to be effective in increasing parents’ breastfeeding knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy. The prototype resource was rated positively by parents and health care providers. Implications for Practice An eHealth breastfeeding co-parenting resource designed with input from the target population is an effective way of providing information to mothers and fathers. Further research with a randomized controlled design and more diverse populations is needed to determine effectiveness of the resource on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. © 2017

TI  - The Development of an Interactive Health Education Model Based on the Djuwita Application for Adolescent Girls
VL  - 40
AB  - Alarming incidents of maternal deaths in Indonesia are due to three major causes: bleeding, sepsis, and hypertension, in addition to other non-obstetric causes and unsafe abortions. Adolescent girls contributed to maternal mortality based on early marriage, unwanted pregnancy, and childbirth. Prevention efforts have been taken through government programs and non-governmental organizations, but in practice those were considered ineffective. Thus, a preventative effort in the form of health education should be made, preferably embedded in a popular mobile application that most teenagers would be apt to use. This study aimed to develop an interactive health education model based on adolescent-friendly applications, according to their needs. The design of this research was mixed-method. A quantitative approach was used by conducting a survey of 188 teenagers aged 15–19 years in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia through questionnaires. This research also contained a qualitative component via in-depth interviews with students, parents, and counseling teachers. The quantitative results showed that respondents’ knowledge was low about male and female reproductive organs, prevention of pregnancy, and the use of condoms. Respondents’ attitudes toward risky behaviors indicate a positive attitude about smoking, drinking, and illegal drugs, as well as premarital sex, while respondents have a negative attitude toward unwanted pregnancies. Respondents’ attitudes toward application-based health education shows a high interest. Respondents desired that the application have privacy, up-to-date information, interesting features, can be discussed with peer groups and health workers, include a game, animation, and simulation, and can identify reproductive health independently. Qualitative results indicate the need for reliable, accessible, and personal sources of information. The next research recommendation is to develop an interactive health education model based on the application of Djuwita and evaluate its influence on the knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy of young women in maintaining their reproductive health. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - The Digital Divide in Health-Related Technology Use: The Significance of Race/Ethnicity
IS  - 1
VL  - 59
AB  - Technology can enhance the health and quality of life of diverse populations and may play an important role in reducing health disparities. Although a 'digital divide' between the young and the old has been noted, it is unclear whether the use of technology for managing health differs by race/ethnicity among older adults. This study uses nationally representative data from community-dwelling older Americans to characterize racial/ethnic differences in health-related technology use. Data came from 1,336 white, black, and Hispanic adults aged 54 and older who completed the 2014 technology module of the Health and Retirement Study. Racial/ethnic differences in overall health-related technology use were assessed using Poisson regression. Then, F-tests were used to assess differences in the use of phone calls, text messages, E-mails, social media, health management sites, health-related mobile applications, web searches, and brain games for health purposes. Compared to whites, older blacks and Hispanics were less likely to use technology for health-related purposes after accounting for demographic characteristics, education, and health conditions. They were also less likely to make or receive phone calls, use health management sites, search the web for health information, and use brain games for their health. Older racial and ethnic minorities are less likely than whites to use certain technologies when managing their health. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the patterns of health-related technology use across racially and ethnically diverse populations to appropriately tailor interventions aimed at improving minority health and eliminating health disparities. © The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - The effectiveness of M-health technologies for improving health and health services: A systematic review protocol
VL  - 3
AB  - Background: The application of mobile computing and communication technology is rapidly expanding in the fields of health care and public health. This systematic review will summarise the evidence for the effectiveness of mobile technology interventions for improving health and health service outcomes (M-health) around the world. Findings: To be included in the review interventions must aim to improve or promote health or health service use and quality, employing any mobile computing and communication technology. This includes: (1) interventions designed to improve diagnosis, investigation, treatment, monitoring and management of disease; (2) interventions to deliver treatment or disease management programmes to patients, health promotion interventions, and interventions designed to improve treatment compliance; and (3) interventions to improve health care processes e.g. appointment attendance, result notification, vaccination reminders. A comprehensive, electronic search strategy will be used to identify controlled studies, published since 1990, and indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, or the UK NHS Health Technology Assessment database. The search strategy will include terms (and synonyms) for the following mobile electronic devices (MEDs) and a range of compatible media: mobile phone; personal digital assistant (PDA); handheld computer (e.g. tablet PC); PDA phone (e.g. BlackBerry, Palm Pilot); Smartphone; enterprise digital assistant; portable media player (i.e. MP3 or MP4 player); handheld video game console. No terms for health or health service outcomes will be included, to ensure that all applications of mobile technology in public health and health services are identified. Bibliographies of primary studies and review articles meeting the inclusion criteria will be searched manually to identify further eligible studies. Data on objective and self-reported outcomes and study quality will be independently extracted by two review authors. Where there are sufficient numbers of similar interventions, we will calculate and report pooled risk ratios or standardised mean differences using meta-analysis. Discussion: This systematic review will provide recommendations on the use of mobile computing and communication technology in health care and public health and will guide future work on intervention development and primary research in this field. © 2010 Free et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - The Effects of a Self-Similar Avatar Voice in Educational Games
IS  - CHI PLAY
VL  - 5
AB  - Avatar identification is one of the most promising research areas in games user research. Greater identification with one's avatar has been associated with improved outcomes in the domains of health, entertainment, and education. However, existing studies have focused almost exclusively on the visual appearance of avatars. Yet audio is known to influence immersion/presence, performance, and physiological responses. We perform one of the first studies to date on avatar self-similar audio. We conducted a 2 x 3 (similar/dissimilar x modulation upwards/downwards/none) study in a Java programming game. We find that voice similarity leads to a significant increase in performance, time spent, similarity identification, competence, relatedness, and immersion. Similarity identification acts as a significant mediator variable between voice similarity and all measured outcomes. Our study demonstrates the importance of avatar audio and has implications for avatar design more generally across digital applications.

TI  - The effects of virtual racial embodiment in a gaming app on reducing
prejudice
IS  - 3
VL  - 83
AB  - This research experimentally examined the effectiveness of the use of
virtual racial embodiment in a digital gaming application for reducing
bias against a non-dominant group. The findings of this study advance
theory and have practical implications for the design of immersive
diversity initiatives. We tested avatar creation and the gaming app as a
new modality for stimulating perspective-taking. In addition, we
explored how sex and race intersect in virtual embodiment and
stereotyping. Results showed that creating and embodying a Black avatar
produced more favorable beliefs about African American men, but not
African American women, and greater support for pro-minority policies in
comparison to creating and playing a White avatar. Avatar liking was a
significant moderator, but self-presence had no effect.

TI  - The Efficacy of a Smartphone Game to Prevent HIV Among Young Africans:
Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial in the Context of COVID-19
IS  - 3
VL  - 11
AB  - Background: Adolescents contribute slightly less than one-third of all
new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa. There is a need for more
effective intervention approaches to help young adolescents safely
navigate through adolescence and into adulthood. We are assessing the
efficacy of Tumaini, a smartphone game designed to prevent HIV among
young Africans. Against the background of COVID-19, meaningful
alteration of the research protocol was necessary to ensure successful
implementation and retention of the study participants in ongoing
research.
Objective: The objective of our protocol is to determine (1) if Tumaini
delays sexual debut and increases condom use at first sex and (2)
whether it influences behavioral mediators of early and unprotected sex.
Methods: Participants were recruited from Kisumu County in Western
Kenya. This study is a 2-arm, individual-randomized controlled trial
that enrolled 1004 adolescents aged between 12 years and 15 years. The
intervention arm participants are playing Tumaini, while the control arm
is provided with Brainilis, a commercially available control game. The
study period will last 45 months At baseline, participants in both arms
completed a baseline survey and biological testing for HIV and herpes
simplex virus, type 2 (HSV-2); participants will have annual game play
periods in years 1-3. They will also complete a total of 12 follow-up
surveys. At endline, repeat biological testing will be conducted.
Protocol adaptations were necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and
implemented in accordance with local public health guidelines.
Results: Participants were enrolled between October 2020 and November
2020. We plan to complete study procedures in September 2024. The
enrolled participant sample was 50.1\% (499/996) female and had a mean
age of 14.0 (SD 0.6) years.
Conclusions: This ongoing research demonstrates that, with appropriate
revisions to planned protocol activities guided by the need to maintain
study integrity, protect both study participants and staff, and adhere
to institutional review board and local health authority guidelines,
human subject research is possible in the context of a global pandemic.
If the trial demonstrates efficacy, Tumaini would provide an
alternative, remote means of delivering age-appropriate education to
adolescents on safer sex, HIV prevention, and effective life skills on a
highly scalable, low-cost, and culturally adaptable platform.

TI  - The Ethics of Mixed Reality Games
AB  - Mixed Reality (MR) Games integrate digital elements with real world places. In doing so they change those places, with important ethical implications. We present a synthesis of 8 existing frameworks on MR Ethics to establish a set of ethical issues for MR Games, and a qualitative analysis of interviews with 17 MR Game Designers to define the strategic approaches they use to address them. We identify 26 ethical issues over 5 dimensions: Claim Rights, Duty of Care, Social Justice, Privacy, and Control; and 59 separate tactics forming 13 strategic approaches over three areas: Design, Participant Management, and Logistics. Mapping these to codes of ethics from the ACM and IEEE we show that the strategies can be seen as methods for behaving ethically within the context of MR Game development, although many strategies rest on the virtues of individual designers and their critical engagement with an ongoing ethical process.

TI  - The Feasibility of a Family-Focused CBT Skills Self-Help App
IS  - 2
VL  - 31
AB  - Behavioral intervention technology (BIT) is one avenue for extending the
reach of evidence-based pediatric mental health. We developed Anchors
Away: Anxiety at Bay, a family-friendly stand-alone mobile health app
for children ages 6 to 11 that delivers CBT strategies tailored to
mental health struggles typical for youth. This study assessed the
acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and fidelity following an
iterative model of development that provided quantitative and
qualitative data. We made changes based on feedback from pilot data and
clinical expert stakeholders and conducted a randomized controlled trial
(RCT). Findings largely supported the acceptability and feasibility of
the app. 71.8\% of those randomized to the app show some degree of
engagement with the child-side of the app and 47.4\% completed all game
modules. Most participants (80\%) reported that they would purchase the
app and found it to be easy to use and helpful in meeting their child's
specific anxiety and emotion regulation challenges.

TI  - The Implementation Playbook: study protocol for the development and feasibility evaluation of a digital tool for effective implementation of evidence-based innovations
IS  - 1
VL  - 4
AB  - Background: Evidence-based innovations can improve health outcomes, but only if successfully implemented. Implementation can be complex, highly susceptible to failure, costly and resource intensive. Internationally, there is an urgent need to improve the implementation of effective innovations. Successful implementation is best guided by implementation science, but organizations lack implementation know-how and have difficulty applying it. Implementation support is typically shared in static, non-interactive, overly academic guides and is rarely evaluated. In-person implementation facilitation is often soft-funded, costly, and scarce. This study seeks to improve effective implementation by (1) developing a first-in-kind digital tool to guide pragmatic, empirically based and self-directed implementation planning in real-time; and (2) exploring the tool’s feasibility in six health organizations implementing different innovations. Methods: Ideation emerged from a paper-based resource, The Implementation Game©, and a revision called The Implementation Roadmap©; both integrate core implementation components from evidence, models and frameworks to guide structured, explicit, and pragmatic planning. Prior funding also generated user personas and high-level product requirements. This study will design, develop, and evaluate the feasibility of a digital tool called The Implementation Playbook©. In Phase 1, user-centred design and usability testing will inform tool content, visual interface, and functions to produce a minimum viable product. Phase 2 will explore the Playbook’s feasibility in six purposefully selected health organizations sampled for maximum variation. Organizations will use the Playbook for up to 24 months to implement an innovation of their choosing. Mixed methods will gather: (i) field notes from implementation team check-in meetings; (ii) interviews with implementation teams about their experience using the tool; (iii) user free-form content entered into the tool as teams work through implementation planning; (iv) Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change questionnaire; (v) System Usability Scale; and (vi) tool metrics on how users progressed through activities and the time required to do so. Discussion: Effective implementation of evidence-based innovations is essential for optimal health. We seek to develop a prototype digital tool and demonstrate its feasibility and usefulness across organizations implementing different innovations. This technology could fill a significant need globally, be highly scalable, and potentially valid for diverse organizations implementing various innovations. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - The influence of competitive and cooperative video games on behavior during play and friendship quality in adolescence
VL  - 91
AB  - Many adolescents play video games together with their friends for multiple hours per week. The way in which peers play games may influence their interactions and relationship. Research has shown distinct effects of competitive and cooperative play on aggression, prosocial behavior, and feelings of empathy and trust. The current study investigated the effect of the mode of gaming on adolescents’ behavior during gaming, as well as their friendship quality and prosocial behavior afterwards, in a field study with experimental design and naturalistic observations. Adolescent friend dyads played a racing video game either solitary, competitively, or cooperatively. Observers coded participants’ behavior during the gaming sessions, while friendship quality and prosocial behavior towards the friend were measured afterwards. Results showed that playing a game competitively lowered friendship quality. Furthermore, the mode of play changed the participants’ behavior during game play, with more positive, negative, and hierarchical behavior observed in the cooperative condition. Additionally, positive and prosocial behavior displayed during the gaming session predicted higher friendship quality afterwards. There were no effects on the subsequent prosocial behavior task. This study illustrates that both the mode in which friends play a video game and the behavior displayed during gaming influence friendship quality. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The Male Domain-Digital Game-Based Learning for Human Papillomavirus
Vaccination Among Young Males
IS  - 5
VL  - 11
AB  - Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually
transmitted disease, with the highest infection rates among those
sexually active under 25. Although vaccination can reduce HPV cancers
among men, public health interventions have primarily targeted females.
Increased gaming rates among men provide innovative opportunities to
motivate behavior change. This study sought to explore which game
development and design strategies are most effective in a game for
sexual health, specifically focused on HPV. We also sought to capture
information relevant to preferred gaming platforms and game mechanics
(health messages, avatars, and visual imagery).Materials and Methods:
Twenty-two (n = 22) qualitative interviews were conducted with experts.
Using grounded theory, interview data was coded, and emergent themes
were identified.Results: Game mechanics most mentioned included
simulation/role-playing, social interaction, narrative, and rewards.
Experts felt it was important to keep the game in the context of the
target audience and integrate the game into an existing game/game
scenario or application. Experts also felt the game should link to
external resources and enlist partnerships or collaborations with
external health agencies. Moreover, while there are benefits to each
gaming platform, games on mobile phones and tablets are most
appropriate.Conclusion: Digital games are a nonconfrontational approach
to discussing HPV and can increase knowledge/awareness and positively
influence behavior change toward vaccine uptake. Digital games present a
safe environment for role-playing through simulated activities without
real-world consequences.

TI  - The measurement of maladaptive cognitions underlying problematic video-game playing among adults
VL  - 55
AB  - Research has shown that some individuals can develop excessive patterns of video-gaming, leading to significant psychological and interpersonal problems. Recent reviews of problematic gaming suggest that treatment is best approached from a cognitive-behavioural perspective. However, relatively little research has examined the underlying cognitive factors that might be usefully targeted in an intervention. To address this gap, we present the findings of a study involving N = 485 adult regular video-game players (84% male, Mage = 26 years) who completed a questionnaire about gaming activity, problematic gaming, and problematic cognitions. Gaming cognitions fell on four dimensions: (1) perfectionism, (2) cognitive salience, (3) regret, and (4) behavioural salience. All cognition subscales correlated moderately to highly with two different measures of problematic gaming (r =.49-.76), as well as a measure of emotional distress (DASS-21; r =.25-.35). Large effect sizes (d =.87-1.96) were found when comparing problematic and non-problematic gamers on all four cognition types. This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence for cognitive differences between problematic and non-problematic video-game players, and to identify specific cognitions which could be practically addressed in clinical settings. The implications for the further development and refinement of clinical approaches to problematic gaming, including formulation, assessment, and intervention, are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The MOSEXY trial: mobile phone intervention for sexual health in youth -
a pragmatic randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a
smartphone application on sexual health in youth in Stockholm, Sweden
IS  - 2
VL  - 97
AB  - An estimated 350 million cases of STIs occur globally each year. In
Sweden, Chlamydia is the most common STI with approximately 30 000 cases
annually, disproportionally affecting youth. National surveys report low
condom use among youth. Smartphone coverage is high among this
tech-savvy group. In collaboration with youth, we developed an
interactive smartphone application comprising games, peer experiences
and information snippets to promote condom use.
Objectives To evaluate in a randomised controlled trial, the
effectiveness of this smartphone application to improve condom use among
youth in Stockholm, Sweden.
Methods This two-arm, individually randomised controlled trial was
implemented through the Youth Health Clinics (YHC) in Stockholm, Sweden.
Youth aged 18-23 years, who owned a smartphone and had >= 2 sexual
partners during the past 6 months were eligible. The intervention
delivered the interactive elements described above over 180 days. The
control group received a `dummy' application. Both groups received
standard of care at the YHC. The primary outcome was proportion of
consistent (100\%) self-reported condom use at 6 months. Secondary
outcomes included self-reported number of partners, occurrence of
STIs/pregnancy and STI tests during the study period. An
intention-to-treat approach was used.
Results 214 and 219 youth were randomised to the intervention and
control groups, respectively. Consistent condom use was reported for
32/214 (15.0\%) in the intervention group and for 35/219 (16.0\%) in the
control group (OR 0.9, 95\% CI 0.5 to 1.6). No significant differences
in secondary outcomes were seen.
Conclusion We were unable to detect an effect of the intervention.
Future research should focus on targeting different subgroups within the
overall risk group, with tailored mHealth interventions. The potential
for such interventions in settings where sexual health services are
unavailable should be evaluated.

TI  - The Notijoves Project: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial About
New Communication Technologies and Gamification to Promote Partner
Notification of Sexually Transmitted Infections Among Young People
IS  - 6
VL  - 8
AB  - Background: An increase in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as
well as an increase in the use of new information and communication
technologies among young people in Catalonia is the inspiration behind
the idea of designing a smartphone app to promote partner notification
of STIs.
Objective: The main objective of this study is to design a Web-based
tool adapted to smartphones for partner notification of STIs among youth
who are 16 to 24 years old. Additionally, the objective is to evaluate
the Web-based tool's role in increasing the patient referral partner
notification.
Methods: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with a
proportional stratification of the sample by center and random
allocation of participants to the 3 arms of the study (simple Web-based
intervention, game Web-based intervention, and control). This study is
being conducted by midwives, gynecologists, and physicians in the sexual
and reproductive areas of the primary health care centers.
Results: The primary outcome measure is the number and proportion of
partner notifications. Additional outcome measures are the yield of
early diagnosis and treatment of those exposed and infected,
acceptability, barriers, and preferences for partner notification.
Expected results include an increase in the yield of partner
notification, early diagnosis and treatment among youth using Web-based
interventions compared with those receiving the traditional advice to
notify, and a description of sexual networks among those participating
in the study.
Conclusions: The Notijoves is expected to have a sustainable positive
impact in the partner notification practice among youth and contribute
to increasing the awareness of STI prevention.

TI  - The paradox of interactive media: The potential for video games and virtual reality as tools for violence prevention
VL  - 5
AB  - Interactive media such as video games and virtual reality (VR) provide users with lived experiences that may be dangerous or even impossible in daily life. By providing interactive experiences in highly authentic, detail-rich contexts, these technologies have demonstrated measurable success in impacting how people think, feel, and behave in the physical world. At the same time, violent interactive media content has been historically connected with a range of antisocial effects in both popular press and academic research. Extant literature has established a small-but-statistically significant effect of interactive media violence on aggressive thoughts and behaviors, which could serve as a risk factor for interpersonal violence. However, left unexplored is the seemingly paradoxical claim that under some conditions, interactive media experiences might protect against interpersonal violence. Drawing on advances in media theory and research and the evolution of interactive media content and production practices, the current manuscript suggests ways in which interactive media violence may be leveraged to lower the likelihood of real-world violence experiences. For example, research on both violent and non-violent games has found that players can (a) express guilt after committing violent acts, (b) report reflective and introspective emotional reactions during gameplay, and (c) debate the morality of their actions with others. Regarding VR, studies have demonstrated that (a) witnessing physical violence in immersive spaces led participants to take the perspective of victims and better understand their emotional state and (b) controlled exposure to traumatic or violent events can be used for treatment. Broadly, studies into video games and VR demonstrate that the impact of actions in virtual worlds transfer into the physical worlds to influence (later) attitudes and behaviors. Thus, how these experiences may be potentially harnessed for social change is a compelling and open consideration, as are side-effects of such interventions on vulnerable groups. The current manuscript summarizes emerging research perspectives (as well as their limitations) to offer insight into the potential for interactive media violence to protect against real-world violence victimization and perpetration. © Bowman, Ahn and Mercer Kollar.

TI  - The Placebo Effect in Digital Games: Phantom Perception of Adaptive Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Play-testing of digital games is a crucial part of any game development process, used to gather feedback about the game and correct any existing and potential flaws with the design. However, due to the nature of human subject testing, the feedback being collected in such experiments is prone to biases. Players' expectations play a great role in dictating their gaming experience, which means the information players receive before trying a new game, as well as the knowledge they already possess, may affect their perception and experience of the game. Two studies were conducted in order to evaluate how priming players to expect a game technology can positively influence their experience. The results supported the hypothesis that even basic instructions can change players' perception of the game, and lead to a higher level of perceived immersion when knowing that the game contains an improved feature, the adaptive artificial intelligence (AI), while it is not present in the game.

TI  - The problematic use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in adolescents by the cross sectional JOITIC study
IS  - 1
VL  - 16
AB  - Background: The emerging field of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has brought about new interaction styles. Its excessive use may lead to addictive behaviours. The objective is to determine the prevalence of the problematic use of ICT such as Internet, mobile phones and video games, among adolescents enrolled in mandatory Secondary Education (ESO in Spanish) and to examine associated factors. Methods: Cross sectional, multi-centric descriptive study. Population: 5538 students enrolled in years one to four of ESO at 28 schools in the Vallès Occidental region (Barcelona, Spain). Data collection: self-administered socio-demographic and ICT access questionnaire, and validated questionnaires on experiences related to the use of the Internet, mobile phones and video games (CERI, CERM, CERV). Results: Questionnaires were collected from 5,538 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 20 (77.3 % of the total response), 48.6 % were females. Problematic use of the Internet was observed in 13.6 % of the surveyed individuals; problematic use of mobile phones in 2.4 % and problematic use in video games in 6.2 %. Problematic Internet use was associated with female students, tobacco consumption, a background of binge drinking, the use of cannabis or other drugs, poor academic performance, poor family relationships and an intensive use of the computer. Factors associated with the problematic use of mobile phones were the consumption of other drugs and an intensive use of these devices. Frequent problems with video game use have been associated with male students, the consumption of other drugs, poor academic performance, poor family relationships and an intensive use of these games. Conclusions: This study offers information on the prevalence of addictive behaviours of the Internet, mobile phones and video game use. The problematic use of these ICT devices has been related to the consumption of drugs, poor academic performance and poor family relationships. This intensive use may constitute a risk marker for ICT addiction. © 2016 The Author(s).

TI  - The relationship between maladaptive personality functioning and problematic technology use in adolescence: A cluster analysis approach
IS  - 6
VL  - 61
AB  - In the last two decades, scientific research has explored the problematic use of internet, videogames and mobile phones. However, there is still little consistent knowledge regarding the co-occurrence of problematic technology use and the role of maladaptive personality characteristics in adolescence. The present study aimed to investigate adolescents' styles of technology use with a cluster analysis approach focusing on personality functioning. The sample comprised 408 Italian adolescents (46.3% males) aged 11 to 18 years (Mage = 13.80; SD = 2.08). Data were collected using the Internet Addiction Test, the Videogame Dependency Scale, the Test of Mobile-Phone Dependence Brief Form and the Personality Inventory for DSM5 Brief Form. Results provided a four-cluster solution based on the co-occurrence of problematic technology use. The four clusters were labeled as follows: cluster 1: “Above average internet and mobile-phone use”; cluster 2: “Below average technology use”; cluster 3: “Above average videogame use”; and cluster 4: “Problematic technology use.” Analyses on demographic variables (e.g., gender and age) demonstrated significant differences between the four groups. Adolescents with high levels of problematic technology use reported greater overall personality dysfunction than the other three groups. This finding supported our hypothesis on maladaptive personality functioning in adolescents at risk for addiction. Finally, the Antagonism domain played a specific role in differentiating the severity of adolescents' involvement in technology use. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to plan preventive interventions as well as therapeutic treatments. © 2020 Scandinavian Psychological Associations and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - The Risk of Online Gambling: a Study of Gambling Disorder Prevalence Rates in Spain
IS  - 2
VL  - 19
AB  - Since the 1990s, gambling has been considered a public health concern. The characteristics of games and the environments in which gambling is carried out are major causes of gambling disorder. Information and communication technologies (e.g., Internet, mobile phones) have been adapted for gambling, and new forms of online gambling have appeared. Online gambling is currently legal in many countries worldwide, and it is continuing to expand globally. In Spain, online gambling has been legal since 2012, when the government authorized companies to operate in this space. Many other countries have been through a similar process of legalization and the promotion of online gambling. In this study, we analyzed the prevalence of gambling disorder in Spain, as well as differences between online and traditional gambling, according to sex and age group. Prevalence indicators of gambling disorder were higher than expected, and this result was especially evident with regard to online gambling. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - The role of life satisfaction in the association between problematic technology use and anxiety in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic
IS  - 1
VL  - 32
AB  - The main aim of this study is to explore problematic technology use among adolescents (Internet, video games, mobiles, and television) and its association with anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, we also analysed the possible moderating role of life satisfaction in this relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. A cross-sectional survey of 4025 children and adolescents (52% females and 48% males) between 12 and 18 years old was carried out to explore problematic technology use and its correlation with anxiety and life satisfaction after pandemic lockdown. Four multivariate regressions containing the independent variable (problematic technology use), the moderator (life satisfaction), and their interaction were entered to predict the outcome (anxiety). The moderated models were examined using SPSS PROCESS macro software (Model 1). Analyses showed significant positive correlations with anxiety and negative correlations with life satisfaction regarding problematic technology use (mobile phone, television, and internet). Both gender and age had a significant direct effect on anxiety (showing that women and older participants had the greatest anxiety). In the moderation analysis, when life satisfaction was higher, the presence of anxiety symptoms depended to a greater extent on the problematic use of technology. Our results confirm that problematic technology use is related to higher levels of anxiety in adolescents, with differences by age and gender. The results also showed that life satisfaction mediated the relationship between technology abuse and anxiety, such that when life satisfaction was higher, the presence of anxiety symptoms was more dependent on problematic technology use. These findings have implications for health and education professionals. © 2022 The Authors. International Journal of Mental Health Nursing published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

TI  - The role of media in influencing students’ STEM career interest
IS  - 1
VL  - 10
AB  - Background: Digital media are pervasive in the lives of young people and provide opportunities for them to learn about STEM. Multiple theories argue that the STEM media environment may shape how youth see a STEM career in their future. Yet, little is known about how pre-college digital media consumption may be related to students’ STEM career interest at the beginning of college. The wide variety of STEM media also raises the question of potentially different effects and pathways by media type. In this study, we collected a nationally representative sample of more than 15,000 students in their first year in U.S. colleges and universities. We asked about their career interests at the beginning of college and also asked them to retrospectively report their STEM media consumption during high school. Results: We found that watching STEM-related TV and online videos, as well as playing STEM-related video games during high school, were positively associated with students’ STEM career interests at the beginning of college. However, we also found that STEM media consumption did not impact directly on STEM career interest, but acted through two intermediaries: STEM identity (I and others see me as a STEM person) and three personal career outcome expectations: a high interest in self-development (enhancement and use of talents), and low interests in material status (money, fame, power) and in interpersonal relationships (helping, and working with, other people). Conclusions: This study finds that STEM media have a significant effect in fostering STEM career interest, with most of the effect coming from STEM TV, STEM video viewing, and STEM video games. The effect is mediated mainly through students’ identity and, to a lesser extent, through personal values, such as self-development, material, and interpersonal relationship values. This study suggests that media communication should be mindful of how different platforms may deliver nuanced and varied messages of what STEM careers may afford and who can succeed in STEM. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - The Role of Technologies, Behaviors, Gender, and Gender Stereotype Traits in Adolescents’ Cyber Aggression
IS  - 7-8
VL  - 35
AB  - The present study focused on the impact of gender and gender stereotype traits (i.e., masculinity, femininity) on cyber aggression perpetration utilizing different technologies (i.e., social-networking sites, gaming consoles, mobile phones) and behaviors (i.e., cyber relational aggression, cyber verbal aggression, hacking). Participants included 233 eighth graders (108 female; Mage = 13.26, SD = 0.36) from two middle schools in the Midwestern United States. Adolescents completed questionnaires on their endorsement of masculinity and femininity traits as well as how often they engaged in cyber aggression perpetration (i.e., cyber relational aggression, cyber verbal aggression, hacking) through mobile phones, social-networking sites, and gaming consoles. Findings indicated that boys and girls with more feminine traits engaged in more cyber relational aggression through social-networking sites and mobile phones, while boys and girls who endorsed more masculine traits perpetrated this behavior and cyber verbal aggression more often through online gaming. In addition, these boys and girls engaged in more hacking through all technologies when compared with girls and boys who reported more feminine traits. Results of this study indicate the importance of delineating gender stereotype traits, behaviors, and technologies when examining cyber aggression perpetration. © The Author(s) 2017.

TI  - The Social Context of Video Game Play: Challenges and Strategies
AB  - People who play video games do so in a range of social contexts: alone, with people they know and don't know, in cooperative and competitive settings. However, little is known about what people enjoy or dislike about these contexts of play, or how to best design games to support player preferences. Using open-ended responses from an online survey (N = 326) and a series of interviews (N = 16) this study shows that the solitary context offers immersive, relaxing, autonomous play, as well as the avoidance of unwanted social interactions. Social play, however, provides competence-enhancing experiences (via competition or teamwork or both) via interactions with others. What was disliked about these contexts indicates where design improvements to both the solitary and social play experiences can be made.

TI  - The Superhero Pose: Enhancing Physical Performance in Exergames by Embodying Celebrity Avatars in Virtual Reality
AB  - Altered virtual reality self-representations can augment human capabilities by exploiting the Proteus effect. For example, previous work has shown that embodying an avatar that signifies super-intelligence, Einstein, enhanced the users’ performance in cognitive tasks. In this paper, we show that embodying an avatar that signifies superior athletic skills enhances the users’ physical performance. We conducted a between-subject experiment (n = 50) where participants played a soccer game while being embodied in a famous soccer avatar and in a generic avatar. We reflect on how self-esteem, embodiment illusion, and presence moderate the Proteus effect. Our results showed that participants embodied as a professional soccer celebrity performed better in the tasks and had a higher sense of embodiment compared to those with a generic avatar. Our results can be used to design engaging exergames and technological interventions to expand human capabilities.

TI  - The Tinder Games: Collective mobile dating app use and gender conforming
behavior
IS  - 1
VL  - 10
AB  - Mobile dating apps like Tinder became very popular among young adults,
and, in contrast to mobile dating websites, they were designed to create
a more game-like experience. While it is well documented that seeking
entertainment is one core motivation for mobile dating app use, the
social nature of entertainment has garnered less attention. Therefore,
in this paper we draw on research on entertainment in dating apps and
the socio-physical contexts of use to identify patterned behaviors of
heterosexual users. To do this, we employed a qualitative multi-phase
research approach. First, we conducted 20 interviews with mobile dating
app users. Based on the findings from that study, we conducted
gender-specific focus groups and a discourse analysis to explore the
social phenomena identified in phase one. Our findings suggest the fun
of mobile dating is not just interacting with potential matches through
the apps, but the use of the apps among one's friends. These ``dating
games{''} are entertaining, but importantly mitigate potential social or
physical risks of mobile dating. Unsurprisingly, notions of ``play{''}
across the interview, focus group, and discourse analyses reflect highly
gendered practices surrounding mobile dating apps and different risks
associated with such games.

TI  - The use of information and communication technologies to promote healthy lifestyle behaviour: A systematic scoping review
IS  - 10
VL  - 9
AB  - Introduction Health-promoting lifestyle behaviours are part of the activities of daily living that influence individual happiness, values and well-being. They play a crucial role in prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among all age groups. Current statistics on mortality, disability and morbidity associated with NCDs are alarming globally. The use of information and communication technology (ICT) for a health-promoting lifestyle behaviour programme enhances health behaviours that are important in the prevention and control of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Our study aimed to map evidence on the use of ICT in comprehensive health-promoting lifestyle behaviour among healthy adults. Methods Eleven electronic databases were searched for the study. We included studies published in English between January 2007 and December 2018 reporting on healthy adults, ICT and any subscales of the health-promoting lifestyle profile (HPLP). Studies focusing on diseases or disease management and studies that combine monitoring tools in the form of hardware (accelerometer or pedometer) with ICT or computer games were excluded. Data were summarised numerically and thematically. Results All the studies reviewed were conducted in developed countries. Most of the studies reported on physical activity, and findings of one study covered all the subscales of HPLP. The use of ICT for health-promoting lifestyle behaviours was reported to be effective in ensuring health behaviours that can improve physical and mental health. Conclusion Our findings showed that there is a dearth of knowledge on comprehensive health-promoting lifestyle behaviour that can be beneficial for the control and prevention of NCDs. There is a need to carry out primary studies on the use of ICT and comprehensive health-promoting lifestyle, especially among adults in low-income and middle-income countries where there are alarming statistics for mortality and disability associated with NCDs.

TI  - The utility of a board game for dengue haemorrhagic fever health education
IS  - 3
VL  - 107
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of an educational board game for increasing knowledge, positive attitudes-beliefs, and self-efficacy for dengue prevention in a sample of Philippine school children and adolescents. Effective board games are more advantageous than lectures because they are adaptable, inexpensive and foster learning independently of teachers or lecturers. Also tested were relationships between perceived fun by students playing the game and outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - A school-based pre-test/post-test experimentally controlled design was employed in a Filipino primary and secondary school population. Findings - The lecture was more effective in increasing knowledge. But neither was more effective than the other in increasing positive attitudes-beliefs and self-efficacy. Both modes produced specifically significant increases in knowledge and self-efficacy; only the lecture produced significant increases in attitudes-beliefs. Also, there was a significant relationship between fun and self-efficacy in the game group at the reduced regression model level but not in the presence of all study variables. Research limitations/implications - No long term outcomes or behavioral change outcomes were measured. However, an educational game may increase knowledge and self-efficacy about the dengue fever without the assistance of a teacher or other pre-game instructional aids. In addition, the board game technique is flexible and easily adapted to other community or school health issues. Originality/value - This was the first experimentally controlled study on the use of a game with the topic of dengue. The study on the use of a game was the first to demonstrate a significant increase in self-efficacy as a result of the play of a board game. Original instruments measured self-efficacy related to dengue control and also the variable of fun. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

TI  - Time 2 tlk 2nite: Use of Electronic Media by Adolescents during Family
Meals and Associations with Demographic Characteristics, Family
Characteristics, and Foods Served
IS  - 7
VL  - 114
AB  - We examined the frequency of adolescents' use of electronic media (ie,
television/movie watching, text messaging, talking on the telephone,
listening to music with headphones, and playing with hand-held games) at
family meals and examined associations with demographic characteristics,
rules about media use, family characteristics, and the types of foods
served at meals using an observational, cross-sectional design. Data
were drawn from two coordinated, population-based studies of adolescents
(Project Eating Among Teens 2010) and their parents (Project Families
and Eating Among Teens). Surveys were completed during 2009-2010.
Frequent television/movie watching during family meals by youth was
reported by 25.5\% of parents. Multivariate logistic regression analyses
indicated significantly higher odds of mealtime media use (P<0.05) for
girls and older teens. In addition, higher odds of mealtime media use
(P<0.05) were also seen among those whose parents had low education
levels or were black or Asian; having parental rules about media use
significantly reduced these odds. Frequent mealtime media use was
significantly associated with lower scores on family communication
(P<0.05) and scores indicating less importance placed on mealtimes
(P<0.001). Furthermore, frequent mealtime media use was associated with
lower odds of serving green salad, fruit, vegetables, 100\% juice, and
milk at meals, whereas higher odds were seen for serving sugar-sweetened
beverages (P<0.05). The ubiquitous use of mealtime media by adolescents
and differences by sex, race/ethnicity, age, and parental rules suggest
that supporting parents in their efforts to initiate and follow-through
on setting mealtime media use rules may be an important public health
strategy.

TI  - Tobacco prevention interventions - developing life skills through playful activities among children and preteens: A systematic review
VL  - 151
AB  - In children and adolescents, risky behaviours such as tobacco use may be addressed by developing life skills. In the field of tobacco prevention, the deployment of playful activities for the development of life skills has received little attention. This review describes the methods and results of tobacco prevention interventions using playful activities to develop life skills in children and preteens. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science and PsycInfo databases. Articles were included in the review based on the following five criteria: (1) the article totally or partially concerns a study of a tobacco prevention intervention; (2) the subjects were children and preteens aged between 6 and 12 years (with an average age within this age range or with an interval including all or part of this age range), from a general or specific population; (3) the intervention was a life skills development action or program; (4) playful activities were employed; (5) design, implementation, evaluation methods and/or results are available in the article. A total of 11 studies, composed of 9 interventions, were included in this systematic review. Most were carried out in school settings (n = 8/11) and involved teachers (n = 7/11). Web-based interventions (video games, mobile health games/websites and e-learning programs) were the playful activities most often used (n = 4/11). The majority of the interventions aimed to develop social skills such as the ability to resist pressure (n = 9/11). In this review, there were only four randomized controlled trial (n = 4/11). The evaluation was immediately after the RCTs. Among the measured outcome variables, knowledge (n = 8/11), attitudes (n = 5/11), intentions (n = 5/11), self-efficacy (n = 4/11) and skills (n = 3/11) were the most assessed. Only two of the studies reviewed here conducted a process evaluation (n = 2/11). This systematic review provides guidance for future youth smoking prevention interventions. Among these, a process evaluation is strongly suggested, as well as the use of appropriate variables and validated scales to assess the effectiveness of prevention programs. In addition, participatory research must allow for the design of adapted and relevant interventions, but also for the proper development of intervention research methodologies in health promotion. © 2023

TI  - To See or Not to See: Understanding the Tensions of Algorithmic Curation for Visual Arts
AB  - Algorithmic recommendation is one of the most popular applications of machine learning (ML) systems. While the implication of algorithmic recommendation has been studied in the context of high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, there has been very little focus in understanding its impacts with respect to the arts domain. Given that ML is increasingly finding place in the arts domain such as in generative arts and content analysis, in this paper, we examine the tensions of algorithmic curation in the context of visual arts. Through case studies, we describe how curatorial algorithms that are oblivious of broader socio-cultural contexts could potentially result in ethical concerns such as over-representation and misattribution, to name a few. Towards addressing some of these concerns, the paper offers design guidelines. Specifically, the paper outlines repair strategies that suggest ways 1) to engage with cultural stakeholders in building visual art curatorial algorithms, 2) to unlearn biases embedded in digital artworks and their meta-data, and 3) emphasize the need to establish regulatory norms specific to the use of ML in visual art curation. Taking cue from the process employed by artwork curators, the paper also describes how authenticity can be prioritized by re-calibrating visual art curatorial algorithms. The paper also suggest ways through which the potential of state-of-the-art ML curatorial algorithms can be re-imagined towards empowering the audience of artworks. We hope the insights presented in the paper spark interdisciplinary discussions and pave way for fostering reformation in algorithmic curation of visual arts.

TI  - To trust or not to trust: social decision-making in post-institutionalized, internationally adopted youth
IS  - 3
VL  - 20
AB  - Chronic parental maltreatment has been associated with lower levels of interpersonal trust, and depriving environments have been shown to predict short-sighted, risk-averse decision-making. The present study examined whether a circumscribed period of adverse care occurring only early in life was associated with biases in trust behavior. Fifty-three post-institutionalized (PI) youth, adopted internationally on average by 1 year of age, and 33 never-institutionalized, non-adopted youth (Mage = 12.9 years) played a trust game. Participants decided whether or not to share coins with a different anonymous peer in each trial with the potential to receive a larger number of coins in return. Trials were presented in blocks that varied in the degree to which the peers behaved in a trustworthy (reciprocal) or untrustworthy (non-reciprocal) manner. A comparison condition consisted of a computerized lottery with the same choices and probabilistic risk as the peer trials. Non-adopted comparison youth showed a tendency to share more with peers than to invest in the lottery and tended to maintain their level of sharing across trials despite experiencing trials in which peers failed to reciprocate. In contrast, PI children, particularly those who were adopted over 1 year of age, shared less with peers than they invested in the lottery and quickly adapted their sharing behavior to peers’ responses. These results suggest that PI youth were more mistrusting, more sensitive to both defection and reciprocation, and potentially more accurate in their trusting decisions than comparison youth. Results support the presence of a sensitive period for the development of trust in others, whereby conditions early in life may set long-term biases in decision-making. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Toward complementary food hygiene practices among child caregivers in rural Malawi
IS  - 2
VL  - 101
AB  - Despite being preventable, foodborne diseases remain a global health challenge. Poor food hygiene practices such as improper handling of kitchen utensils are among the major causes of diarrhea transmission. A formative study was conducted in Malawi to inform an intervention design to promote complementary food hygiene practices. An assessment of contextual and psychosocial factors for behavior change was conducted using Risk, Attitude, Norms, Ability, and Self-regulation model.Weconducted 323 household surveys with caregivers of children aged 6 to 24 months. Analysis of variance was used to estimate difference between doers and non-doers of three targeted behaviors: washing utensils with soap, keeping utensils on a raised place, and handwashing with soap. Analysis of variance analyses revealed that literacy level, ownership of animals, and presence of handwashing facility and dish racks were contextual factors predicting storage of utensils on an elevated place and handwashing frequencies. Psychosocial factors, such as time spent to wash utensils with soap, distance to the handwashing facility, and cost for soap, had an influence on washing utensils and handwashing practices. Perceived vulnerability determined effective handwashing and storage of utensils. Perceived social norms and ability estimates were favorable for the three targeted behaviors. Promotion of already existing targeted beneficial behaviors should be encouraged among caregivers. Risk perceptions on storage of utensils and handwashing practices should be increased with motivational exercises such as paint games. Caregivers' technical know-how of local dish rack and tippy tap construction is essential. © 2019 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

TI  - Towards an AI-driven talking avatar in virtual reality for investigative interviews of children
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming systems have advanced to the stage where the current models and technologies can be used to address real-world problems. The development of such systems comes with different challenges, e.g., most of them related to system performance, complexity and user testing. Using a virtual reality (VR) environment, we have designed and developed a game-like system aiming to mimic an abused child that can help to assist police and child protection service (CPS) personnel in interview training of maltreated children. Current research in this area points to the poor quality of conducted interviews, and emphasises the need for better training methods. Information obtained in these interviews is the core piece of evidence in the prosecution process. We utilised advanced dialogue models, talking visual avatars, and VR to build a virtual child avatar that can interact with users. We discuss our proposed architecture and the performance of the developed child avatar prototype, and we present the results from the user study conducted with CPS personnel. The user study investigates the users' perceived quality of experience (QoE) and their learning effects. Our study confirms that such a gaming system can increase the knowledge and skills of the users. We also benchmark and discuss the system performance aspects of the child avatar. Our results show that the proposed prototype works well in practice and is well received by the interview experts.

TI  - Towards an avatar mentor framework to support physical and psychosocial treatments
IS  - 1
VL  - 2
AB  - The clinical care of patients with chronic life-limiting conditions and terminal illness has improved. However, intense treatment regimens make patients feel isolated, particularly among young children and adolescents who require psychosocial care. Failure to address this issue can leave patients feeling depressed and isolated. Social networking and digital entertainment have helped to address some of these issues, particularly for house bound and long stay patients in a hospital. It has allowed patients to remain in contact with family and friends, express how they feel and find information about their condition. Nevertheless, these kinds of solutions are too general to support the specific psychosocial needs of patients. This paper builds on these technologies and explores the idea of improving communications between medical practitioners and patients using avatars (digital characters that have controllable expressions, animations and speech) in computer games to guide and encourage patients to comply with treatments, provide support, and elicit information about their well-being. We have successfully developed several prototype systems to evaluate the applicability of our approach. © 2012 IUPESM and Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Traditional games and child-centred development: affirming disabled and female bodies in applied theatre projects in Zimbabwe
IS  - 3
VL  - 32
AB  - Traditional/indigenous children’s games are yet to be appreciated as sites of critical engagement. The limited available literature on traditional children’s games is mainly focused on the deployment of traditional games in the teaching of conventional curriculum subjects. On the other hand, applied theatre projects appear to mainly rely on ‘foreign’ games. Curiously, there seems to be bias towards theatre games from North America, South America and Western Europe. We concede that, to an extent, the deployment of foreign games has revolutionized and radicalized applied theatre practice in Zimbabwe. However, there is hardly any serious scholarship that examines implications of infusing traditional children’s games within gender and disability discourse for child-centred development. This article addresses the extent to which applied theatre practitioners may appropriate traditional children’s games in the quest to deploy theatre as a site of critical engagement against pervasive hegemonies such as masculinity, neo-colonialism and ableism that may impede on human-/child-centred development. Drawing from Africana Womanism and Critical Disability Theory, we argue that although currently few applied theatre practitioners are deploying traditional children’s games, there is scope for appropriating and contextualizing traditional games in subverting imposed ableist and gendered hegemonies. Applied theatre projects can offer space to recover the rich intangible heritage that is embodied in traditional games. Having established that indigenous African children’s games affirm the material body in general, we recognize the potential of applied theatre contexts to act as sites of taping from the wisdom of the past in order to invent the future in which Africa/Zimbabwean children are proud of their bodily realities as centres of human growth and self-construction. © 2018 South African Theatre Journal.

TI  - Training citizen scientists through an online game developed for data quality control
IS  - 1
VL  - 3
AB  - Some form of training is often necessary for citizen science projects. While in some citizen science projects, it is possible to keep tasks simple so that training requirements are minimal, other projects include more challenging tasks and, thus, require more extensive training. Training can be a hurdle to joining a project, and therefore most citizen science projects prefer to keep training requirements low. However, training may be needed to ensure good data quality. In this study, we evaluated whether an online game that was originally developed for data quality control in a citizen science project can be used for training for that project. More specifically, we investigated whether the CrowdWater game can be used to train new participants on how to place the virtual staff gauge in the CrowdWater smartphone app for the collection of water level class data. Within this app, the task of placing a virtual staff gauge to start measurements at a new location has proven to be challenging; however, this is a crucial task for all subsequent measurements at this location. We analysed the performance of 52 participants in the placement of the virtual staff gauge before and after playing the online CrowdWater game as a form of training. After playing the game, the performance improved for most participants. This suggests that players learned project-related tasks intuitively by observing actual gauge placements by other citizen scientists in the game and thus acquired knowledge about how to best use the app instinctively. Interestingly, self-assessment was not a good proxy for the participants' performance or the performance increase through the training. These results demonstrate the value of an online game for training. These findings are useful for the development of training strategies for other citizen science projects because they indicate that gamified approaches might provide valuable alternative training methods, particularly when other information materials are not used extensively by citizen scientists. © Author(s) 2020.

TI  - Trait and state impulsivity in males with tendency towards
Internet-pornography-use disorder
VL  - 79
AB  - Introduction: Impulsivity has been identified to be involved in the
development and maintenance of specific Internet-use disorders (IUD). It
can be differentiated between relatively stable trait impulsivity and
state impulsivity which is dependent on environmental and affective
factors such as craving. Following the I-PACE (Interaction of
Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution) model, both trait and state
impulsivity may play an interactive role in IUD. The present study aimed
to investigate the relationship between trait and state impulsivity and
symptom severity of Internet-pornography-use disorder (IPD) as one form
of IUD.
Methods: Fifty heterosexual males participated in this study. State
impulsivity was measured with reaction times in a modified stop-signal
task. Each participant conducted two blocks of this task which included
neutral and pornographic pictures. Moreover, current subjective craving,
trait impulsivity, and symptom severity of IPD were assessed using
several questionnaires.
Results: Results indicate that trait impulsivity was associated with
higher symptom severity of IPD. Especially those males with higher trait
impulsivity and state impulsivity in the pornographic condition of the
stop-signal task as well as those with high craving reactions showed
severe symptoms of IPD.
Conclusion: The results indicate that both trait and state impulsivity
play a crucial role in the development of IPD. In accordance with
dual-process models of addiction, the results may be indicative of an
imbalance between the impulsive and reflective systems which might be
triggered by pornographic material. This may result in loss of control
over the Internet-pornography use albeit experiencing negative
consequences.

TI  - Translating an effective group- based hiv prevention program to a program delivered primarily by a computer: Methods and outcomes
IS  - 2
VL  - 23
AB  - We describe development of SAHARA (SISTAS Accessing HIV/AIDS Resources At-a-click), an innovative HIV prevention program that uses a computer to deliver an updated version of SiSTA, a widely used, effective group-level HIV prevention intervention for African American women ages 18-29. Fidelity to SiSTA's core components was achieved using: (1) video clips featuring group discussions and modeling of appropriate sexual- and contraceptive-related behavior; and (2) interactive Flash modules facilitating cognitive rehearsal, providing learning experiences through games and quizzes, and providing opportunities for simulated role-play. A preliminary outcome study of SAHARA conducted at Planned Parenthood, Atlanta, found that SAHARA, when followed by a brief 20-minute wrap-up group session facilitated by a health educator, was effective in promoting consistent condom use for vaginal sex. We discuss the potential advantages and challenges of an intervention like SAHARA delivered by computer to an individual, versus one like SiSTA delivered by a health educator to a small group. © 2011 The Guilford Press.

TI  - Translating group programmes into online formats: Establishing the acceptability of a parents' sex and relationships communication serious game Health behavior, health promotion and society
IS  - 1
VL  - 15
AB  - Background: With ongoing concerns about the sexual health and wellbeing of young people, there is increasing need to innovate intervention approaches. Engaging parents as agents to support their children, alongside capitalising on increasingly sophisticated technological options could jointly enhance support. Converting existing programmes into interactive game based options has the potential to broaden learning access whilst preserving behaviour change technique fidelity. However the acceptability of this approach and viability of adapting resources in this way is yet to be established. This paper reports on the process of converting an existing group programme ("What Should We Tell the Children?") and tests the acceptability within a community setting. Methods: Translation of the original programme included selecting exercises and gathering user feedback on character and message framing preferences. For acceptability testing, parents were randomised to either the game (n = 106) or a control (non-interactive webpage) condition (n = 76). At time 1 all participants completed a survey on demographics, computer literacy and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) items. Post intervention (time 2) users repeated the TPB questions in addition to acceptability items. Interviews (n = 17) were conducted 3 months post intervention to gather qualitative feedback on transfer of learning into real life. Results: The process of conversion identified clear preferences for first person role play, home setting and realistic characters alongside positively phrased feedback. Evaluation results show that the game was acceptable to parents on cognitive and emotional dimensions, particularly for parents of younger children. Acceptability was not influenced by baseline demographics, computer skills or baseline TPB variables. MANOVA analysis and qualitative feedback suggest potential for effective translation of learning into real life. However attrition was more likely in the game condition, potentially due to feedback text volume. Conclusions: A manualised group programme can be viably converted into a serious game format which is both cognitively and emotionally acceptable. The intervention may be more effectively targeted at parents with younger children, and further game developments must particularly address information dosing. Establishing the viability of digitally converting a group programme is a significant step forward for implementation focused research. © 2015 Bayley and Brown.

TI  - Understanding Diabetes through Watch Based Interactive Play
AB  - Play based systems, such as computer games, have proven effective as tools to enhance our human understanding, skills and capabilities in a number of real world activities. The active pursuit of gamification and applied games for tasks from education to design, training and simulation continues to grow. The field of healthcare is one key area offering significant potential. Raising the question of whether play based assistive tools, as a means to create greater understanding of serious medical conditions, and the health and lifestyle impacts they cause, can be effective. This research involved both the review of play based systems that are dedicated to assisting with diabetes, as well as the development of a new watch based mobile App designed specifically to assist players (both diabetic as well as broader community) in understanding the complex nature of managing diabetes. Diabetes is listed as the sixth leading cause of death worldwide and its improved management is listed as a priority by the world health organization. The results from the randomized control trial of the new watch based tool showed that participants who used the play based watch App, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of their understanding of the condition and its management. This highlights the potential of play based digital tools to bring greater understanding of complex medical conditions to patients, care givers and the broader population.

TI  - Understanding screen-related sedentary behavior and its contributing factors among school-aged children: A social-ecologic exploration
IS  - 5
VL  - 23
AB  - Purpose. To explore the factors that contribute to children's screen-related sedentary (S-RS) behaviors. Settings. Elementary schools. Subjects. A random sample of children in grades five and six and their parents. Measures. The outcome measure was children's S-RS activity level measured by a selfadministered questionnaire. A full spectrum of potential contributing factors for children's S-RS behaviors was obtained through surveys. Multilevel linear regression methods were used to determine the associations between these factors and children's screen time (hours per day) and results were expressed as regression coefficients (g). Results. Of 955 child-parent pairs in 14 participating schools, 508 pairs(53%) completed the surveys. At an intrapersonal level, protective factors included being a girl (g = -. 71); belonging to a sports team inside (g = -.56) or outside (g = -.49) of school; having a negative attitude toward S-RS activities (g = -. 13); and having a positive attitude toward physical activity (g = - .48). At the interpersonal and social levels, parental leisure S-RS behaviors (g = .32) were positively associated, whereas strict parentalrules on computer use(g= -.27) and family income (g= -.32) were inversely correlated with S-RS behavior. At the environmental level, the presence of TVs in children's bedrooms (g = .44) and owning videogame devices (g = .58) increased the risk of S-RS behaviors, whereas after school programs (g= -.86) and schools'participation in the Turn Off the Screen Week campaign (g = -.91) decreased the risk. Conclusions. Public health interventions should target multilevel factors, including increasing children's awareness, promoting parental involvement in healthy lifestyle pursuits, and creating less screenogenic environments.

TI  - United States Adolescents' Television, Computer, Videogame, Smartphone, and Tablet Use: Associations with Sugary Drinks, Sleep, Physical Activity, and Obesity
VL  - 182
AB  - Objective To quantify the relationships between youth use of television (TV) and other screen devices, including smartphones and tablets, and obesity risk factors. Study design TV and other screen device use, including smartphones, tablets, computers, and/or videogames, was self-reported by a nationally representative, cross-sectional sample of 24 800 US high school students (2013-2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys). Students also reported on health behaviors including sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, physical activity, sleep, and weight and height. Sex-stratified logistic regression models, adjusting for the sampling design, estimated associations between TV and other screen device use and SSB intake, physical activity, sleep, and obesity. Results Approximately 20% of participants used other screen devices for ≥5 hours daily. Watching TV ≥5 hours daily was associated with daily SSB consumption (aOR = 2.72, 95% CI: 2.23, 3.32) and obesity (aOR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.40, 2.27). Using other screen devices ≥5 hours daily was associated with daily SSB consumption (aOR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.69, 2.32), inadequate physical activity (aOR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.69, 2.25), and inadequate sleep (aOR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.54, 2.08). Conclusions Using smartphones, tablets, computers, and videogames is associated with several obesity risk factors. Although further study is needed, families should be encouraged to limit both TV viewing and newer screen devices. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Unlock Me: A Real-World Driven Smartphone Game to Stimulate COVID-19 Awareness
VL  - 164
AB  - Despite having numerous platforms to promote coronavirus awareness, a part of the population is not well informed about the basic knowledge related to the pandemic. This inspired us to design and implement a free-to-play game, Unlock Me, to help people learn about coronavirus easily yet effectively. A user-centric approach to designing the game has helped us understand the challenges people face and eventually to deliver an interactive game. We conducted an evaluation study across multiple age groups to understand the impact of Unlock Me to enhance COVID-19 learning of the player and to evaluate the quality of the game. The results are obtained by studying the player behavior and performing comparative analysis with Model for the Evaluation of Educational Games (MEEGA+), a standard game evaluation model. Our evaluation shows that there has been an increase in the awareness of players by 53% compared to pre-game awareness. 52.40% of the players found the game to be usable with a good player experience and learning. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Unpacking Invisible Work Practices, Constraints, and Latent Power Relationships in Child Welfare through Casenote Analysis
AB  - Caseworkers are trained to write detailed narratives about families in Child-Welfare (CW) which informs collaborative high-stakes decision-making. Unlike other administrative data, these narratives offer a more credible source of information with respect to workers’ interactions with families as well as underscore the role of systemic factors in decision-making. SIGCHI researchers have emphasized the need to understand human discretion at the street-level to be able to design human-centered algorithms for the public sector. In this study, we conducted computational text analysis of casenotes at a child-welfare agency in the midwestern United States and highlight patterns of invisible street-level discretionary work and latent power structures that have direct implications for algorithm design. Casenotes offer a unique lens for policymakers and CW leadership towards understanding the experiences of on-the-ground caseworkers. As a result of this study, we highlight how street-level discretionary work needs to be supported by sociotechnical systems developed through worker-centered design. This study offers the first computational inspection of casenotes and introduces them to the SIGCHI community as a critical data source for studying complex sociotechnical systems.

TI  - Usability and Satisfaction Testing of Game-Based Learning Avatar-Navigated Mobile (GLAm), an App for Cervical Cancer Screening: Mixed Methods Study
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: Barriers to cervical cancer screening in young adults include a lack of knowledge and negative perceptions of testing. Evidence shows that mobile technology reduces these barriers, thus, we developed a web app, Game-based Learning Avatar-navigated mobile (GLAm), to educate and motivate cervical cancer screening using the Fogg Behavioral Model as a theoretic guide. Users create avatars to navigate the app, answer short quizzes with education about cervical cancer and screening, watch videos of the screening process, and earn digital trophies. Objective: We tested ease of use, usefulness, and satisfaction with the GLAm app among young adults. Methods: This mixed methods study comprised a qualitative think-aloud play interview session and a quantitative survey study. Participants were cervical cancer screening–eligible US residents aged 21 to 29 years recruited through social media. Qualitative study participants explored the app in a think-aloud play session conducted through videoconference. Data were analyzed using directed content analysis to identify themes of ease of use, usefulness, and content satisfaction. Qualitative study participants and additional participants then used the app independently for 1 week and completed a web-based survey (the quantitative study). Ease of use, usefulness, and satisfaction were assessed using the validated Technology Acceptance Model and Computer System Usability Questionnaire adapted to use of an app. Mean (SD) scores (range 1-7) are presented. Results: A total of 23 individuals participated in one or both study components. The mean age was 25.6 years. A majority were cisgender women (21/23, 91%) and White (18/23, 78%), and 83% (19/23) had at least some secondary education. Nine participants completed the think-aloud play session. Direct content analysis showed desire for content that is concise, eases anxiety around screenings, and uses game features (avatars and rewards). Twenty-three individuals completed the quantitative survey study. Mean scores showed the app was perceived to be easy to use (mean score 6.17, SD 0.27) and moderately useful to increase cervical cancer screening knowledge and uptake (mean score 4.94, SD 0.27). Participants were highly satisfied with the app (mean score 6.21, SD 1.20). Conclusions: Survey results showed participants were satisfied with the app format and found it easy to use. The app was perceived to be moderately useful to inform and motivate cervical cancer screening, notably, the screening reminder function was not tested in this study. Qualitative study results demonstrated the app’s ability to ease anxiety about screening through demonstration of the screening process, and brevity of app components was favored. Interpretation of results is limited by the predominantly cisgender, White, and educated study population, additional testing in populations which historically have lower cervical cancer screening uptake is needed. A modified version of the app is undergoing efficacy testing in a randomized clinical trial. © Lindsey J Wanberg, Angela Kim, Rachel I Vogel, Karim Thomas Sadak, Deanna Teoh.

TI  - Use of an interactive trivia game to increase knowledge and awareness of appropriate antibiotic use in community-dwelling older adults: A pilot survey
IS  - 11
VL  - 29
AB  - Objective: To assess change in knowledge and awareness of upper respiratory-tract infections (URTIs), and appropriate antibiotic use in community-dwelling older adults. Design: Single group, pre- and post-test study. Setting: Two independent senior living communities in Baltimore City and Baltimore County, Maryland. Participants: Older adults eligible to receive housing or other social services as defined by the study sites. Intervention: Use of an interactive trivia game to educate older adults about URTIs. A 15-item pre- and postsurvey was administered to assess change in knowledge. Outcome Measures: Average change in pre- and postsurvey scores. Results: Thirty-two seniors participated in the game intervention, with 18 completing both surveys. There was no significant difference in the total mean pre- versus postsurvey scores. Average scores of pre- and postsurveys were 9.28 and 9.17, respectively, out of 15 points (95% confidence interval 0.65 +/- 1.414; P = 0.76). Upon review of individual survey questions, two specific areas showed a significant improvement on postsurvey scores compared with baseline. Participants showed significant improvement, however, in knowledge regarding symptoms that may require the use of an antibiotic (P = 0.02) and symptomatic management of URTI symptoms (P = 0.045). Conclusions: Based on survey results, we learned more about older adults' knowledge regarding URTIs, antibiotic use, and strategies to provide education to communitydwelling geriatric adults. The game was effective in teaching older adults about symptom management and symptoms that may require an antibiotic. © 2014 American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - USE OF ELECTRONIC GAMES BY YOUNG CHILDREN AND FUNDAMENTAL MOVEMENT
SKILLS?
IS  - 3
VL  - 114
AB  - This study investigated associations between pre-school children's time
spent playing electronic games and their fundamental movement skills. In
2009, 53 children had physical activity (Actigraph accelerometer counts
per minute), parent proxy-report of child's time in interactive and
non-interactive electronic games (min./week), and movement skill (Test
of Gross Motor Development-2) assessed. Hierarchical linear regression,
adjusting for age (range=3-6 years), sex (Step 1), and physical activity
(cpm; M=687, SD=175.42; Step 2), examined the relationship between time
in (a) non-interactive and (b) interactive electronic games and
locomotor and object control skill. More than half (59\%, n=31) of the
children were female. Adjusted time in interactive game use was
associated with object control but not locomotor skill. Adjusted time in
non-interactive game use had no association with object control or
locomotor skill. Greater time spent playing interactive electronic games
is associated with higher object control skill proficiency in these
young children. Longitudinal and experimental research is required to
determine if playing these games improves object control skills or if
children with greater object control skill proficiency prefer and play
these games.

VL  - 15
AB  - The presence of technologies in all areas and stages of life increases the risk of addiction to devices, networks, and the use of various programmes. Excessive use of devices and technologies during childhood and adolescence has negative effects on neurodevelopment and causes emotional disorders related to anxiety, stress, and depression. These disorders can be associated with the development of other addictions (alcohol, psychoactive substances) or other situations of risk of social exclusion such as bullying, among others. In our study of the risk of social exclusion in adolescents (ÁVALOS RUIZ, 2022) we have applied a complete diagnostic battery to 25 subjects of both sexes between 12 and 17 years of age focusing on six dimensions of risk: anxiety and depression, alcohol and other substance abuse, bullying, addiction to technologies, gender violence and risk behaviour in love and sexual relationships, and difficult family situation. The aim of this paper is to present and analyse the correlations found between each of the first three dimensions, and the technology addiction dimension as a predictor of other risk factors for social exclusion. The data show that addiction to video games, in particular, is related to high levels of depression, while addiction to any of the technologies studied (mobile, internet and video games) is significantly related to being a victim of bullying. © 2022 Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.

TI  - Use of information and communication technology (ICT) and perceived health in adolescence: The role of sleeping habits and waking-time tiredness
IS  - 4
VL  - 30
AB  - The first aim for this paper was to examine gender and age differences in the intensity of usage of information and communication technology (ICT: computer for digital playing, writing and e-mailing and communication, and Internet surfing, and mobile phone). Second, we modelled the possible mediating role of sleeping habits and waking-time tiredness in the association between ICT usage and perceived health (health complaints, musculoskeletal symptoms, health status). The participants were 7292 Finns aged 12, 14, 16 and 18 years responding to a postal enquiry (response rate 70%). The results showed that boys played digital games and used Internet more often than girls, whose mobile phone usage was more intensive. Structural equation model analyses substantiated the mediating hypothesis: intensive ICT-usage was associated with poor perceived health particularly or only when it negatively affected sleeping habits, which in turn was associated with increased waking-time tiredness. The associations were gender-specific especially among older adolescents (16- and 18-year olds). Intensive computer usage forms a risk for boys', and intensive mobile phone usage for girls' perceived health through the mediating links. Girls were vulnerable to the negative consequences of intensive mobile phone usage, as it associated with perceived health complaints and musculoskeletal symptoms both directly and through deteriorated sleep and increased waking-time tiredness. The results of gender-specific ICT usage and vulnerability are discussed as reflecting gendered psychophysiological, psychological and social developmental demands. © 2006 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

TI  - Use of media technologies by native american teens and young adults in the Pacific Northwest: Exploring their utility for designing culturally appropriate technology-based health interventions
IS  - 3-4
VL  - 32
AB  - American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth are disproportionally burdened by many common adolescent health issues, including drug and alcohol use, injury and violence, sexually transmitted infections, and teen pregnancy. Media technologies, including the Internet, cell phones, and video games, offer new avenues for reaching adolescents on a wide range of sensitive health topics. While several studies have informed the development of technology-based interventions targeting mainstream youth, no such data have been reported for AI/AN youth. To fill this gap, this study quantified media technology use among 405 AI/AN youth (13-21 years old) living in tribes and urban communities in the Pacific Northwest, and identified patterns in their health information-seeking practices and preferences. Overall, technology use was exceptionally common among survey respondents, mirroring or exceeding national rates. High rates of online health information seeking were also reported: Over 75% of AI/AN youth reported searching online for health information. These data are now being used by the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and NW tribes to design culturally-appropriate, technology-based health interventions targeting AI/AN youth. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Use of mobile applications and health technologies among dementia caregivers with chronic conditions: A cross-sectional study
VL  - 9
AB  - Objective: Almost 80% of people, who are caring for someone with dementia, have one or more chronic conditions and require self-management support. New technologies offer promising solutions; however, little is known about what technologies caregivers use for their health or in general. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of mobile application (app) and health-related technology use among caregivers who have chronic conditions and care for someone with dementia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 122 caregivers recruited online and from communities in the Baltimore-metropolitan area. Data were collected with online surveys and computer-assisted telephone interviews. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze survey data. Results: Study participants were primarily female (95 of 122, 77.9%), middle-aged (average 53 years, standard deviation (SD) 17), well educated (average 16 years, SD 3.3), an adult child of the person with dementia (53 of 122, 43.4%), and had 4 chronic conditions on average (SD 2.6). Over 90% of caregivers used mobile apps (116 of 122), spending a range of 9 to 82 min on each app. Most caregivers reported using social media apps (96 of 116, 82.8%), weather apps (96 of 116, 82.8%), and/or music or entertainment apps (89 of 116, 76.7%). Among caregivers using each app type, more than half of caregivers used social media (66 of 96, 69%), games (49 of 74, 66%), weather (62 of 96, 65%), and/or music or entertainment apps (51 of 89, 57%) daily. Caregivers also used several technologies to support their own health—the most common being websites, mobile devices, and health-related mobile apps. Conclusion: This study supports the feasibility of using technologies to promote health behavior change and support self-management among caregivers. © The Author(s) 2023.

TI  - Use of Mobile Applications to Increase Therapeutic Adherence in Adults: A Systematic Review
IS  - 12
VL  - 46
AB  - Failure to comply with therapeutic treatments implies negative repercussions for the patient's quality of life, their social environment, and health system. The use of information and communication technologies, especially mobile applications, has favored the increase in global therapeutic adherence figures. The objective of this study is to characterize the use of mobile applications as a strategy to increase therapeutic adherence in adults. A systematic literature review in Web of Science and Scopus was performed following the Preferred Information elements for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis. Information such as: the year of publication, the study population, the medical conditions of the participants, the main characteristics or functionalities of the mobile applications, and the methods or tools used to measure treatment adherence were extracted from each included article. The risk of bias was assessed. Twelve randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English from 1996 to May 2021, were included. Chronic diseases have been mostly addressed through interventions with mobile applications. The most reported functions of mobile applications were reminders, educational modules, two-way communication, and games. Tools such as: "Morisky Medication Adherence Scale of eight items"; "Medication adherence questionnaire"; "Self-reported adherence"; among others, were used to evaluate and report the treatment adherence. In conclusion, including treatment interventions using mobile applications in clinical practice has proven to be beneficial to improve therapeutic adherence. However, it is necessary to develop high-quality clinical trials (size and duration) to generalize results and justify their use in conventional health services. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Use of Social Media Marketing in Healthcare
IS  - 2
VL  - 15
AB  - Social media is an umbrella term that defines online technology and practices used to share opinion, insights, experience and perspectives. Social media are low cost marketing tools that help in facilitating the building of networks, instant dissemination of information and thus encouraging trust and confidence of public. It can take many forms like text, images, audio and video. According to Kaplan and Haenlein, there are six different types of social media: collaborative projects (e.g., Wikipedia), blogs and micro blogs (e.g., Twitter), content communities (e.g., YouTube, Flicker), social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, MySpace), virtual game worlds (e.g., World of Warcraft, Whyville), and virtual social worlds (e.g., Second Life). Based on this classification, extensive literature search was done from a range of sources like journals, books and internet websites of relevant disciplines, including public health organizations, hospitals and case studies prepared on each type exploring the use of social media in health promotion. The objective of this paper is to explain the use of social media marketing in health promotion and education and discuss various interventions done, using social media marketing tools in promoting public health. Finally, it is discussed like every coin has two sides, social media provides large opportunity for health promotion in the public health community, enabling public health professionals to reach out far and wide and directly to the public on multiple public health issues and at the same time its cautious use is imperative to prevent colossal damage. Social media, a communication boon for the public health community has the potential to promote and change many health-related behaviours and issues particularly in times of crisis. © 2013 Indian Institute of Health Management Research.

TI  - Use of virtual games for interactive learning in a pharmacy curriculum
IS  - 1
VL  - 11
AB  - Background and purpose: To evaluate student pharmacists’ attitudes and satisfaction toward playing educational virtual games in the classroom. Educational activity and setting: Virtual games were played in the classroom setting. First year student pharmacists participated in two Mimycx quests in the Healthcare Communication and the Psychiatry/Neurology courses. Students were randomly assigned into teams and worked together to complete the assigned quest games. Completion of the pre- and post-quest questionnaires via Qualtrics was voluntary. Findings: A total of 79 student pharmacists played the Mimycx quests. Only 66 students completed both pre- and post-quest questionnaires. Students indicated their familiarity with game concepts related to the virtual environment and avatars used in the study. The change in their attitudes and satisfaction about the Mimycx virtual learning experience was significant between the two learning time points. The use of virtual gaming technology could enhance student pharmacists’ learning and engagement in the classroom. Students benefitted from increased familiarity with virtual, educational gaming concepts in their experiences with Mimycx, although no statistically significant differences were found regarding their attitudes toward communication and teamwork. © 2018

TI  - User-Agent Bond in Generalizable Environments: Long-Term Risk-Reduction
via Nudged Virtual Choices
VL  - 12
AB  - Avatars or agents are digitized self-representations of a player in
mediated environments. While using agents to navigate through mediated
environments, players form bonds with their self-agents or characters, a
process referred to as identification. Identification can involve
automatic, but temporary, self-concept ``shifts in implicit
self-perceptions `` (Klimmt et al., 2010, p. 323) of the media user by
adopting or emphasizing the action choices on behalf of the social
expectation of the avatar in the mediated environment. In the current
study, we test the possibility that users' identification with video
game avatars-a bond built between avatars and players- would account for
subsequent behavior changes. We did so by using 3-month longitudinal
data involving a narratively-based serious game: Socially Optimized
Learning in Virtual Environments (SOLVE), a 3D-interactive game designed
to reduce risky sexual behaviors among young men who have sex with men
(n = 444). Results show that video game identification predicts both the
reduction of risky sexual behaviors over time, and reduction in the
number of non-primary partners with whom risky sex occurs. And when
players identify with the game character, they tend to make healthier
choices, which significantly mediates the link between video game
identification and reduction of risky behaviors.

TI  - User Experience Adaptation of Complex Game Interface for User Behaviour Modeling Using RNN
IS  - 4
VL  - 6
AB  - In a video game review, the main focus is the narratives, characters, graphics, and mechanics in the gameplay. Some recent research mentions the user interface only when it comes into light as a creative platform for simple interactive narratives from a technical point of view; this narrative is mainly a software tool that requires traditionally modernized inputs from the user. The user needs to interact with the navigational controls or menus in order to start a basic game play. A complex game interface as stimulus is generally considered as having a feeling of immersion that allows for visual tracking of user behavioural patterns and use it to predict the next strategy of the user using robust computational models. A number of users have limited sensory perception in a gameplay and hence rely on complex game stimulus and an adaptive model is paramount when considering behavioural expectations that place the user in a digital environment with more expressive perceptions. We developed a custom based eye tracking and 3D object detection algorithm which was utilised by recruiting users to interact with visual 3D objects and trace their eye movement behaviour to generated data. We then applied the use of recurrent neural network (RNN) for direct tracing of user behavioural activities in a sequential manner to predict their behaviour for interface adaptation. Result indicates that redundant user attributes are flexible and flawless for identifying predicted response of the user in a controlled environment. This would lead to prototypical representation of user behavioural analytics as an embedded platform in the confined digital environment. One of the limitations of the project is its inability to basically specify the 3D gaze point at the inner boundaries of the visual field. Data visualisation is strictly based on combined object flow detection. The originality of the work is its ability to redefine fixation point to a rendered cascaded 3D gaze point and space-defined saccade which is indicated by the distance between one gaze points to the other. The 3D gaze point would be well suited for fixation generalisation on 3D as well as on 2D digital oriented environment. © The author(s) 2022.

TI  - Using a mobile Virtual Reality and computer game to improve visuospatial self-efficacy in middle school students
VL  - 192
AB  - Visuospatial (VS) skills, or one's ability to mentally manipulate spatial information about objects, are critical to STEM enrollment, retention, and achievement. Low level of VS skills may deter some people from joining the STEM workforce or complicate their learning experience. While there is plenty of evidence suggesting that VS skills can be improved through training, few accessible training programs exist as of now, particularly for younger students. The current study proposes a new direction of VS training focusing on the development of visuospatial self-efficacy (VSSE), or one's confidence that they can complete specific VS tasks. The collaborative, desktop/mobile Virtual Reality game called [hidden for peer review] (available for download at [hidden for peer review]) was designed to improve VSSE in middle school students. A total of 169 students across 11 classrooms in 3 middle schools in a mid-western city in the United States participated in the intervention. The participants in the experimental condition (n=96, 6 classrooms) played the intervention game during 4 sessions over the course of 2 weeks, while the participants in the control condition (n=73, 5 classrooms) engaged in typical class activities. The results revealed that the intervention significantly increased students’ VS self-efficacy but not their VS performance or STEM performance. The implications and significance of the findings are discussed along with suggestions for further research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Using an interactive visual novel to promote patient empowerment through engagement
AB  - In this paper we describe a prototype of a serious game designed to improve hospital patients' confidence in managing their hospital stay. We present findings of an evaluation of our visual novel computer game by comparing it with traditional approaches to increasing patient empowerment and patient self-efficacy. The results indicated a significant effect of the type of intervention on improvement in empowerment, but only for participants with gaming experience or who achieved a high level of engagement in the game. This study provides evidence that games may outperform other types of health intervention under certain conditions.

TI  - Using crowdsourcing to develop a peer-led intervention for safer dating app use: pilot study
IS  - 4
VL  - 4
AB  - Background: Smartphone-based dating apps are rapidly transforming how people seek potential sexual and romantic partners. However, they can also increase the risk of unsafe sexual behaviors, harassment, and infringement of personal privacy. Current research on interventions for safer dating app use remains insufficient. Objective: The goal of this study was to describe the development of an intervention for safer dating app usage using crowdsourcing and peer-led approaches. Methods: This paper describes the development of an intervention program designed to promote safer dating app use among college students. Crowdsourcing and peer-led approaches were adopted during key stages of the development process. Focus group discussions were held to assess the experience and needs of dating app users. A crowdsourcing contest then solicited ideas for performance objectives for the intervention. These objectives were grouped to further identify practical strategies. A one-day intensive workshop was subsequently held with peer mentors to brainstorm ideas for the production of creative interventional materials. The intervention programs were produced and tested in a pilot study. The app’s effectiveness will be evaluated in a cluster randomized controlled trial. Results: The intervention program consists of a risk assessment tool, a first-person scenario game, and four short videos. The risk assessment tool, comprised of 14 questions, will give the participant a score to determine their level of risk of adverse events when using dating apps. The scenario game is a first-person simulation game where the players are presented with choices when faced with different scenarios. The short videos each last 2-4 minutes, with points of discussion aimed at addressing the risks of using dating apps. The programs were piloted and were found to be relatable and helpful when further modifications were made. Conclusions: Potential challenges identified during the development process included data management and analysis, sustaining peer mentors’ interests and participation, and balancing between providing more information and perpetuating social stigma around dating app use. By integrating new approaches, such as crowdsourcing and the peer-led approach, in developing an intervention for safer dating app use, our development process provides a viable model for developing future interventions to address the risks associated with dating app use. ©William Chi Wai Wong, Lin Song, Christopher See, Stephanie Tze Hei Lau, Wai Han Sun, Kitty Wai Ying Choi, Joseph Tucker.

TI  - Using ecological momentary assessment to determine media use by individuals with and without major depressive disorder
IS  - 4
VL  - 165
AB  - Objective: To use ecological momentary assessment techniques to measure the association of major depressive disorder (MDD) with media use. Design: Data were collected using an ecological momentary assessment protocol with cellular telephone - based brief interviews. Setting: Participants received as many as 60 telephone calls from a trained staff member during 5 extendedweekends in an 8-week period. Participants: One hundred six adolescent participants who were part of a larger neurobehavioral study of depression in Pittsburgh from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2008. Main Exposure: At each call, participants were asked whether they were using the following 5 types of media: television or movies, music, video games, Internet, and print media, such as magazines, newspapers, and books. Main Outcome Measures: We developed multivariable models to determine the independent association of each type of media use with MDD, controlling for sociodemographic variables. Results: Of the 106 participants, 46 were diagnosed as having MDD. In multivariable models controlling for age, sex, and race, each increasing quartile of audio use was associated with an 80% increase in the odds of having MDD (odds ratio,1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.8; P=.01 for trend). Conversely, each increasing quartile of print media use was associated with a 50% decrease in the odds of having MDD (odds ratio,0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.9; P=.009 for trend). Conclusions: Major depressive disorder is positively associated with popular music exposure and negatively associated with reading print media such as books. Further research elucidating the directionality and strength of these relationships may help advance understanding of the relationships between media use and MDD. ©2011 American Medical Association.

TI  - Using methods from computational decision-making to predict nonadherence to fitness goals: Protocol for an observational study
IS  - 11
VL  - 10
AB  - Background: Can methods from computational models of decision-making be used to build a predictive model to identify individuals most likely to be nonadherent to personal fitness goals? Such a model may have significant value in the global battle against obesity. Despite growing awareness of the impact of physical inactivity on human health, sedentary behavior is increasingly linked to premature death in the developed world. The annual impact of sedentary behavior is significant, causing an estimated 2 million deaths. From a global perspective, sedentary behavior is one of the 10 leading causes of mortality and morbidity. Annually, considerable funding and countless public health initiatives are applied to promote physical fitness, with little impact on sustained behavioral change. Predictive models developed from multimodal methodologies combining data from decision-making tasks with contextual insights and objective physical activity data could be used to identify those most likely to abandon their fitness goals. This has the potential to enable development of more targeted support to ensure that those who embark on fitness programs are successful. Objective: The aim of this study is to determine whether it is possible to use decision-making tasks such as the Iowa Gambling Task to help determine those most likely to abandon their fitness goals. Predictive models built using methods from computational models of decision-making, combining objective data from a fitness tracker with personality traits and modeling from decision-making games delivered via a mobile app, will be used to ascertain whether a predictive algorithm can identify digital personae most likely to be nonadherent to self-determined exercise goals. If it is possible to phenotype these individuals, it may be possible to tailor initiatives to support these individuals to continue exercising. Methods: This is a siteless study design based on a bring your own device model. A total of 200 healthy adults who are novice exercisers and own a Fitbit (Fitbit Inc) physical activity tracker will be recruited via social media for this study. Participants will provide consent via the study app, which they will download from the Google Play store (Alphabet Inc) or Apple App Store (Apple Inc). They will also provide consent to share their Fitbit data. Necessary demographic information concerning age and sex will be collected as part of the recruitment process. Over 12 months, the scheduled study assessments will be pushed to the subjects to complete. The Iowa Gambling Task will be administered via a web app shared via a URL. Results: Ethics approval was received from Dublin City University in December 2020. At manuscript submission, study recruitment was pending. The expected results will be published in 2022. Conclusions: It is hoped that the study results will support the development of a predictive model and the study design will inform future research approaches. © JMIR Public Health and Surveillance 2021.

TI  - Using rating arrays to estimate score distributions for player-versus-level matchmaking
AB  - Rating systems (like Elo and Glicko-2) have previously been used for predicting the expected score that a player will achieve on a level. We present an approach that predicts not a single score, but an approximate cumulative distribution function over possible scores. This approach assigns each level an array of multiple ratings for different score thresholds. Our long-term goal is twofold: first, to dynamically change level difficulty for each player by using this CDF to tailor the target score required to complete a level; second, in human computation games (HCGs), to identify players capable of setting new high scores that could correspond to improved solutions to underlying tasks. To move towards this goal, we explore the rating array approach using two datasets: one gathered from the HCG Paradox, and one generated from idealized players and levels. We examine the accuracy of the CDF and the expected scores it predicts, as well as its use in serving levels to players who could set new high scores.

TI  - Using simulation to enhance primary care sexual health services for breast cancer survivors: a feasibility study
IS  - 10
VL  - 31
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the impact of a virtual simulation game (VSG) to improve primary care sexual health services for breast cancer survivors. Methods: We developed a VSG to help primary care providers (PCPs) address sexual health disturbances among breast cancer survivors. We used a pretest–posttest design with a series of validated tools to assess the feasibility and perceived impact of the VGS, including an open-ended question about participants’ perceptions. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics and qualitative data through an inductive content analysis approach. Results: Of the 60 participants, the majority were nurse practitioner students (n = 26; 43.3%), female (n = 48; 80%), and worked full-time (n = 35; 58.3%). Participants perceived the VSG as feasible and potentially effective. The intervention elicited an improvement in PCPs’ perception of knowledge between pretest and posttest surveys (z = − 1.998, p = 0.046). Professional background and previous exposure to sexual health training were predictors of knowledge perception. Participants described the intervention as an engaging educational strategy where they felt safe to make mistakes and learn from that. Conclusions: VSGs can be a potentially effective educational approach for PCPs. Our findings indicate that despite being an engaging interactive strategy, VSG interventions should be tailored for each professional group. Implications for cancer survivors: This intervention has potential to improve the knowledge and practice of PCPs related to breast cancer follow-up care to support comprehensive care for survivors, resulting in a better quality of life and patient outcomes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Using the Behaviour Change Wheel Program Planning Model to Design Games for Health: Development Study
IS  - 4
VL  - 9
AB  - Background: Games for health are a promising approach to health promotion. Their success depends on achieving both experiential (game) and instrumental (health) objectives. There is little to guide game for health (G4H) designers in integrating the science of behavior change with the art of game design. Objective: The aim of this study is to extend the Behaviour Change Wheel program planning model to develop Challenges for Healthy Aging: Leveraging Limits for Engaging Networked Game-Based Exercise (CHALLENGE), a G4H centered on increasing physical activity in insufficiently active older women. Methods: We present and apply the G4H Mechanics, Experiences, and Change (MECHA) process, which supplements the Behaviour Change Wheel program planning model. The additional steps are centered on identifying target G4H player experiences and corresponding game mechanics to help game designers integrate design elements and G4H objectives into behavioral interventions. Results: We identified a target behavior of increasing moderate-intensity walking among insufficiently active older women and key psychosocial determinants of this behavior from self-determination theory (eg, autonomy). We used MECHA to map these constructs to intervention functions (eg, persuasion) and G4H target player experiences (eg, captivation). Next, we identified behavior change techniques (eg, framing or reframing) and specific game mechanics (eg, transforming) to help realize intervention functions and elicit targeted player experiences. Conclusions: MECHA can help researchers map specific linkages between distal intervention objectives and more proximal game design mechanics in games for health. This can facilitate G4H program planning, evaluation, and clearer scientific communication. © Michael C Robertson, Tom Baranowski, Debbe Thompson, Karen M Basen-Engquist, Maria Chang Swartz, Elizabeth J Lyons.

TI  - Utilization of information and communication technology (ICT) among sexually transmitted disease clinics attendees with coexisting drinking problems
IS  - 1
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: Alcohol misuse remains a major risk factor for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) not typically addressed in STD clinic settings. Information and communication technology (ICT) can offer new avenues to deliver evidence-based screening and treatment for problematic drinking, however, few data exists regarding the utilization of ICT among STD clinic attendees with coexisting drinking problems. The objectives of this study are to identify STD clinics attendees with hazardous drinking, to examine socio-demographic factors associated with ICT use, and to explore individuals' interests in engaging in ICT-based health interventions. Methods. Cross-sectional questionnaires examining alcohol consumption and ICT use were administered to 396 persons attending two non-urban STD clinics. Descriptive statistics for ICT use were calculated for both hazardous drinkers and the entire sample. Multivariable logistic regression models among hazardous drinkers identified factors significantly associated with use of each kind of ICT. Results: The mean age of the 396 participants was 25 years, 66% were females and 60% were African-Americans. One third of the sample met the criteria of hazardous drinking. ICT use in hazardous drinkers included 94% reporting having internet access at least monthly, 82% reporting having an email account, 85% reporting currently owning a cell phone, and 91% reporting use of any cell phone application. More than two thirds (73%) of hazardous drinkers were willing to play health-related video games during clinic waiting time, slightly higher than the entire sample (69%). Multivariable analyses indicated that younger age were significantly related to monthly internet use, and multifunction cell phone use, while being males and younger age were significantly associated with monthly video game playing. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates commonality of ICT use among STD clinic attendees with hazardous drinking, indicating the viability of using ICT to assist screening and behavioural intervention for alcohol misuse in STD clinic settings. Future research is needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of ICT-based health behavioural interventions in the STD clinic settings or other venues that serve populations at high risk for substance abuse, HIV or other STDs. © 2014 Hu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Utilizing Digital Health Technologies for Patient Education in Lifestyle Medicine
IS  - 2
VL  - 14
AB  - Technology has redefined the way patients and providers communicate and obtain health information. The realm of digital health encompasses a diverse set of technologies, including mobile health, health information technology, wearable devices, telehealth and telemedicine, and personalized medicine. These technologies have begun to improve care delivery without the traditional constraints of distance, location, and time. A growing body of evidence supports the use of digital health technology for improving patient education and implementation of skills and behaviors integral to lifestyle medicine. Patient education can now be delivered in standard formats (eg, articles, written messages) as well a wide array of multimedia (video, audio, interactive games, etc), which may be more appropriate for certain topics and learning styles. In addition, patient engagement in their care plays an important role in improving health outcomes. Despite digital health technology development often outpacing its research, there is sufficient evidence to support the use of many current technologies in clinical practice. Digital health tools will continue to grow in their ability to cost-effectively monitor and encourage healthy behaviors at scale, and better methods of evaluation will likely increase clinician confidence in their use. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Values throughout the Game Space
IS  - CHI PLAY
VL  - 6
AB  - Pro-social themes like empathy and wellbeing are gaining popularity within games to contrast the medium's stigmatised explorations of themes like violence, often to catalyse reflection or even change players' beliefs surrounding complex scenarios. These abstract themes can be classified as a game's "values": elements that are "useful or important" to game designers and their audience.Exploration of values in games was spearheaded by Values at Play, which described how values manifest in games and advocated for their explicit consideration within games and their discourse. Frameworks such as empathy, ethical, and anti-oppressive design all discuss similar values, but present ontological diversity that makes it difficult to collate games and frameworks under the values-conscious design umbrella. Such frameworks also often focus on design approaches and small-scale prototypes but pay less attention to how values influence aspects like publication and play. As such, the present research examines values within each stage of a game's lifecycle: design, development, publication, interaction, and reportage. Doing so provides an understanding of values in multiple game contexts. This provides new perspectives that form the basis of a taxonomy for values in games, which is then presented alongside practical questions for values-conscious designers, publishers, and players to guide its use.

TI  - Video Game Interface Design Patterns to Facilitate Human-Agent Teaming
AB  - User interface design patterns that document Human-Agent Team (HAT) interface best practices were developed by analyzing team video games with different types of agents, ranging from virtual players in sports games to advisors contributing to strategy and planning in combat games. One factor that may contribute to the enormous success of some games is the cohesive team interactions between humans and agents. A design pattern collection was developed by identifying 25 design patterns under interface themes most relevant to HATs. The design patterns describe how multiple successful game interfaces handle challenging aspects of HAT interaction, addressing contexts including planning, spatial orientation, task management, communication, and more. Based on the complex and well-tested interface solutions in video games, these design patterns can provide HAT user interface developers practical guidance for interface development and a starting point for developing a HAT design pattern language. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Video games as virtual teachers: Prosocial video game use by children and adolescents from different socioeconomic groups is associated with increased empathy and prosocial behaviour
VL  - 63
AB  - Objective The main aim of this study was to determine if there was a positive relationship between prosocial video game use and prosocial behaviour in children and adolescents. Method This study had a cross-sectional correlational design. Data were collected from 538 9-15 year old children and adolescents between March and December 2014. Participants completed measures of empathy, prosocial behaviour and video game habits. Teachers rated the prosocial behaviour of participants. The socioeconomic status of participants was also gathered. Results Multiple linear regressions were conducted on these data. Prosocial video game use was positively associated with the tendency to maintain positive affective relationships, cooperation and sharing as well as empathy. This association remained significant after controlling for gender, age, school type (disadvantaged/non-disadvantaged), socioeconomic status, weekly game play and violent video game use. Conclusions These findings provide evidence that prosocial video game use could develop empathic concern and improve affective relationships in a diverse population of young people. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Video Game to Attenuate Pandemic-Related Stress from an Equity Lens: Development and Usability Study
IS  - 5
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: The emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has introduced additional pressures on an already fragile mental health care system due to a significant rise in depression, anxiety, and stress among Canadians. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is known to be an efficacious treatment to reduce such mental health issues, few people have access to CBT in an engaging and sustainable manner. To address this gap, a collaboration between the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) developed CBT-based self-led, online, clinician-tested modules in the form of a video game, named Legend of Evelys, and evaluated its usability in the attenuation of a COVID-19–related increase in stress. Objective: We here present the conceptualization and design of new self-care modules in the form of a video game, its implementation in a technological infrastructure, and inclusivity and privacy considerations that informed the development. A usability study of the modules was performed to assess the video game’s usability, user engagement, and user perceptions. Methods: The development of the video game involved establishment of a technology infrastructure for secure implementation of the software for the modules and a clinician-led assessment of the clinical utility of these modules through two “whiteboard” sessions. The usability study was informed by a mixed methods sequential explanatory design to evaluate the intervention of the mobile app through two distinct phases: quantitative data collection using in-app analytics data and two surveys, followed by qualitative data collection by semistructured interviews. Results: A total of 32 participants trialed the app for 2 weeks. They used the video game an average of six times and rated the game as “good” based on the Systems Usability Scale score. In terms of stress reduction, the study demonstrated a significant difference in the participants’ Perceived Stress Scale score at baseline (mean 22.14, SD 6.187) compared with that at the 2-week follow-up (mean 18.04, SD 6.083; t27=3.628, P=.001). Qualitative interviews helped participants identify numerous functionality issues and provided specific recommendations, most of which were successfully integrated into the video game for future release. Conclusions: Through this collaboration, we have established that it is possible to incorporate CBT exercises into a video game and have these exercises adopted to address stress. While video games are a promising strategy to help people with their stress and anxiety, there is a further need to examine the real-world effectiveness of the Legend of Evelys in reducing anxiety. ©Nadia Minian, Anika Saiva, Allison Gayapersad, Rosa Dragonetti, Catherine Proulx, Patricia Debergue, Julia Lecce, Sarwar Hussain, Eric Desjardins, Peter Selby.

TI  - Virtual addictions: An examination of problematic social casino game use among at-risk gamblers
VL  - 64
AB  - The overlap of gaming and gambling activities within online digital technologies is of growing relevance to the study of technological addictions. Social casino games are immensely popular ‘free to play’ games that offer realistic emulation of financial gambling activities. Their structural similarities might suggest that engagement in social casino games may be particularly risky for people with existing gambling problems. Currently it is not known whether social casino games are used problematically by individuals who also experience problematic gambling, the extent of this overlap, the characteristics of those who experience problems with both activities, and the symptoms of problematic social casino game use they experience. An online survey was administered to Internet users (N = 1554) to assess social casino game use and associated problems. This study examined a subsample of 176 adults who played social casino games and reported self-identified gambling problems. The results indicated that a greater frequency and diversity of social casino game playing and more frequent and larger expenditure on social casino games was significantly positively associated with symptom severity of problematic social casino game use. Gamblers who were younger, less educated, spoke a non-English language, and with higher psychological distress, were more likely to report greater problems. Playing social casino games to escape or relieve a negative mood was the most commonly reported symptom. These findings suggest that some problem gamblers may also be at risk of problematic engagement in online gambling activities that lack financial incentives. Gamblers' concurrent engagement in social casino games therefore warrants further consideration in gambling research studies and clinical practice settings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Virtual decisions: video game ethics, Just Consequentialism, and ethics on the fly
IS  - 3
VL  - 39
AB  - Video games are ethically controversial. Some video games are effective training tools for learning various skills and approaches to problem-solving, but some video games are notorious for promoting discriminatory and barbaric behavior. We consider such ethical pros and cons of video games, but we also present a more fundamental ethical issue about video games. Most video games have a bias toward self-centered decision-making. Often the decision-making driver is not the impact of the decision on society but rather the quantity of rewards for their individual character. This bias can be an obstacle to employing good ethical analysis and good ethical decision-making in video games. In this paper we discuss the ethical theory of Just Consequentialism and show how it can be used to introduce ethical values into video game design and how it can be useful for ethical decision-making, even rapid ethical decision-making, in both virtual world and real worlds.

TI  - Virtual Experiences, Physical Behaviors: The Effect of Presence on
Imitation of an Eating Avatar
IS  - 4
VL  - 18
AB  - In this study, the role of presence in the imitation of a virtual model
was examined. Immersive virtual environment technology (IVET) was used
to create photorealistic virtual representations of the self that were
depicted eating food in a virtual world. Changes in the virtual
environment (via a changing or unchanging body) were incorporated to
create variance in perceived subjective presence. Based on previous
research, presence was hypothesized to affect the relationship between
the environmental manipulations and the behavioral outcome of imitating
the avatar's eating behavior. Here we show that presence did indeed
affect imitation, but that the effects varied for men and women in
accordance with previous research on sex differences in eating behavior.
Men who experienced high presence were more likely than low presence men
to imitate the virtual model and eat candy, whereas women who
experienced high presence were more likely than low presence women to
suppress the behavior and not eat candy.

TI  - Virtual Reality Simulation for Advanced Infection Control Education in
Neonatal Intensive Care Units: Focusing on the Prevention of Central
Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections and Ventilator-Associated
Infections
IS  - 16
VL  - 11
AB  - This study examined the effects of a virtual reality simulation for
advanced infection control education in neonatal intensive care units
(VR\_AICENICU) on nurses' infection control knowledge and performance
confidence. We examined nurses' presence, empathy, and program
satisfaction using a non-equivalent control group pre-post design.
Nurses were divided into an experimental group (n = 20) experiencing VR
simulation and routine NICU practice and a control group (n = 20) with
routine NICU practice. The VR\_AICENICU program comprised three
scenarios: high-risk medication with lipid solution, dressing and
management for peripheral inserted central line, and aspiration
prevention and skincare management during ventilator use for premature
infants. Data were collected between February and July 2022. The
experimental group showed significantly greater improvements in
infection control knowledge and performance confidence compared to the
pre-test. The average scores of presence, empathy, and program
satisfaction of the experimental group were 4.39 +/- 0.36, 4.33 +/-
0.75, and 4.90 +/- 0.31, respectively. The VR\_AICENICU program has
implications for the education needs of nurses working in NICUs and
enhances their knowledge and performance of infection control. Future
studies should apply the VR\_AICENICU program to different severity
grades of NICU patients and develop additional VR programs.

TI  - Watch what I do, not what I say I do: Computer-based avatars to assess behavioral inhibition, a vulnerability factor for anxiety disorders
VL  - 55
AB  - Behavioral inhibition (BI), a tendency to withdraw from or avoid novel social and non-social situations, is a personality trait which can confer risk for anxiety disorders. Like many personality traits, BI is often assessed via self-report questionnaires where respondents rate themselves for frequency of certain behaviors or feelings. However, questionnaires have inherent limitations, particularly in psychiatric populations where there may be unawareness of deficit. A viable alternative may be virtual environments, in which the participant guides an on-screen "avatar" through a series of onscreen events meant to simulate real-world situations. Here, we report on initial development of such an assessment tool, involving several onscreen scenarios with choice points where the participant can select from response options corresponding to inhibited or uninhibited behaviors. In two experiments involving over 300 college students, scores on the computer-based task were strongly correlated with BI scores attained through self-report questionnaire (r > .780, p < .001); this relationship held regardless of participant gender and experience with computer games. The results suggest that virtual environments may hold promise as alternative formats for assessment of personality traits in populations unsuited to traditional paper-and-pencil questionnaire formats due to psychopathology, limited attention span, or poor vocabulary and/or literacy skills.

TI  - “What's Your Name Again?”: How Race and Gender Dynamics Impact Codesign Processes and Output
IS  - 6
VL  - 30
AB  - Creating technology products using codesign techniques often results in higher end-user engagement compared to expert-driven designs. Codesign sessions are typically structured in flexible and informal ways to achieve equal design partnerships, especially in adult-child interactions. This generally leads to better design output, however, it may also increase the enactment of socially constructed stereotypes and biases in ways that negatively affect the experiences of racial minorities and girls/women in design spaces. We codesigned a video game with a K-5 afterschool program located in a working-class, rural, predominantly white county over 20 weeks. We uncover ways that the codesign process and different activity types can create a permissive environment for enacting behaviors that are harmful to minorities. We discuss ways to manage and restructure codesign programs to be more conducive for children and adults from diverse backgrounds, ultimately leading to healthier design partnerships.

TI  - Who You Are Can Predict What You Say on a Virtual Date: Traits as
Predictors of Communication Patterns of Young Men Who Have Sex With Men
VL  - 16
AB  - Using virtual environments (VE), we examine-for the first time-how
individuals' traits predict ``first date,{''} in-the-moment
conversational choices. We look at how attachment anxiety, avoidance,
and Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) predict virtual conversational
choices (i.e., to dismiss, deny, or reciprocate in virtual conversations
during a virtual date). We tested this possibility through socially
optimized learning in virtual environments (SOLVE-IT), a web-based,
interactive 3D video game intervention designed for young men who have
sex with men (YMSM) to reduce risky sexual behaviors. Data analyzed were
drawn from 358 HIV-negative, self-identified MSM aged from 18 to 24, who
were part of the SOLVE-IT intervention. Using ordinary least squares
regression, we found that both BIS and attachment styles affect
in-the-moment conversational responses and that attachment moderates the
effects of BIS on those responses. The implications of these findings
are discussed.

TI  - Why Do Iranian Preschool-Aged Children Spend too Much Time in Front of Screens? A Preliminary Qualitative Study
IS  - 7
VL  - 10
AB  - There is evidence that Iranian preschool children are increasingly spending their time in front of screens (screen time: ST; time spent with any screen such as TVs, computers, tablets, smartphones, game consoles, or video games), but few studies have explored the possible causes of such an increase. Given this, the present study aimed to qualitatively explore determinants of excessive ST in Iranian children. To this end, parents of preschool children were interviewed, and their answers were qualitatively clustered to identify additional important factors. Key informant interviews were conducted with parents of preschool children in Tehran (Iran). A semi-structured interview was developed to assess child and family life, daily routine, family rules, family interactions, and home climate as possible contributing factors to ST. Parents’ audiotaped statements were transcripted verbatim, coded, and clustered into main themes using thematic analysis with the MaxQda® software. A total of 20 parents of children aged 2 to 7 were interviewed, and a total of 6 key themes and 28 subthemes were extracted from their interviews. The results of the analysis identified a broad range of both independent and interrelated factors leading to the development and maintenance of ST behaviors among preschool children. Our findings indicate that the central concept is the family. Considering screen-related behaviors, family life encompasses parental health literacy (e.g., parenting pattern, monitoring standards, thoughtful parenting), family psychological atmosphere (e.g., presence of parents, family norms, parent–parent and parent–child interaction, congruency/incongruency of parents with each other) and the digital structure of the home. The child’s and parents’ actions and characteristics can influence family interactions. A child’s and parent’s behavior is also influenced by social/cultural factors. Parents’ behaviors and attitudes, family communications, and interactions contribute to healthy ST habits in children. It is not possible to examine the child’s behavior without considering the family and the dominant environment, since the behavior of family members as a whole affects each family member. Given this, interventions should make parents aware of their role and responsibilities in reducing children’s ST and consider the family system as a whole, and interventions also can benefit from considering the parental perceptions of children’s behaviors. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Why do men hunt? A reevaluation of "Man the Hunter" and the sexual division of labor
IS  - 1
VL  - 50
AB  - The role of men in hunter-gatherer societies has been subject to vigorous debate over the past 15 years. The proposal that men hunt wild game as a form of status signaling or "showing off" to provide reproductive benefits to the hunter challenges the traditional view that men hunt to provision their families. Two broad assumptions underlie the signaling view: (1) hunting is a poor means of obtaining food, and (2) hunted game is a public good shared widely with others and without expectation of future reciprocation. If hunters lack the ability to direct food shares and obtain subsequent benefits contingent on redistribution, then the ubiquitous observations of male hunting and universal pair-bonding cannot be explained from a perspective that emphasizes kin provisioning and a division of labor. Here we show that there is little empirical support for the view that men hunt for signaling benefits alone. The ethnographic record depicts a more complex relationship between food sharing patterns, subsistence strategies, mating, and the sexual division of labor. We present a framework incorporating trade-offs between mating and subsistence strategies in an economic bargaining context that contributes to understanding men's and women's roles in huntergatherer societies. © 2009 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

TI  - Why iPlay: The Relationships of Autistic and Schizotypal Traits With Patterns of Video Game Use
VL  - 13
AB  - Video games are popular and ubiquitous aspects of human culture, but their relationships to psychological and neurophysiological traits have yet to be analyzed in social-evolutionary frameworks. We examined the relationships of video game usage, motivations, and preferences with autistic and schizotypal traits and two aspects of neurophysiology, reaction time and targeting time. Participants completed the Autism Quotient, Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, a Video Game Usage Questionnaire, and two neurophysiological tasks. We tested in particular the hypotheses, motivated by theory and previous work, that: (1) participants with higher autism scores would play video games more, and participants with higher schizotypy scores would play video games less; and (2) autism and positive schizotypy would be associated with opposite patterns of video game use, preferences and motivations. Females, but not males, with higher autism scores played more video games, and exhibited evidence of relatively male-typical video game genre preferences and motivations. By contrast, positive schizotypy was associated with reduced video game use in both genders, for several measures of game use frequency. In line with previous findings, males played video game more than females did overall, preferred action video games, and exhibited faster reaction and targeting times. Females preferred Puzzle and Social Simulation games. Faster reaction and targeting times were associated with gaming motives related to skill development and building behavior. These findings show that gaming use and patterns reflect aspects of psychology, and gender, related to social cognition and imagination, as well as aspects of neurophysiology. More generally, the results suggest that video game use is notably affected by levels of autistic and schizotypal traits, and that video games may provide an evolutionarily novel medium for imaginative play in which immersive play experiences can be decoupled from social interaction.

AB  - The information on the use of Videogames (VG) in general samples fundamentally reflects the characteristics of men, because of their greater participation in VG, making it difficult to identify the characteristics of women and their gaming activity. Objective: To describe the gaming behaviour of adolescent and young women in Madrid, and its relation with the development of gaming problems. Method: A self-report questionnaire (Gamertest) was applied to a sample of 1,228 women (12-22 years old) (M = 14.84; SD = 2.469), selected by randomized sampling in schools in the Community of Madrid. Results: 51% of women admit gaming. The typical profile is a woman who plays VG sporadically and for short periods of time, preferably Action and Adventure games or Puzzles and Platforms, mainly on smartphones, at home and alone, with the purpose of having fun. The main predictive variables of gaming problems, identified with the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) in women are: a greater number of hours of use, playing Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), and Strategy VG. The most protective factor is playing VG accompanied. The results are discussed. © 2022: Editum. Universidad de Murcia (Spain).

TI  - Yeayyy.com: venturing into mobile app business
IS  - 6
VL  - 25
AB  - Subject area: “Starting up a new company” and “development of technology-based venture”. Study level/applicability: The target audiences for this study are advanced business or non-business undergraduate students and MBA students taking courses of entrepreneurship, management of innovation and organization theory and design. Case overview: Yeayyy.com was a private limited company based in Bandar Baru Bangi, Selangor, a township located about 30 km south of Kuala Lumpur. It was founded by Mr Hazmin in early 2010 with a seed funding of RM150,000 (about US$50,000). By the end of 2014, its core businesses include developing mobile application (app), software and website, as well as conducting information technology (IT) training. The company had developed its own animation cartoon, Oolat Oolit, and had commercialized several mobile app inventions. These mobile apps include a Jawi (traditional Malay writing system) app, mobile games and Facebook apps which were compatible with most mobile operating systems. Since its inception, Yeayyy.com had aspired to follow the footsteps of the internationally acclaimed Malaysian home-grown animation production house, Les’ Copaque, which had produced the popular Upin Ipin series. Similar to Les’ Copaque, Yeayyy.com also planned to commercialize its in-house characters into TV series and to market related merchandises, along with its collaborative partner, CikuTree Studio. However, by the end of 2014, the company’s seed funding had depleted, thus forcing Mr Hazmin to strategize for the company’s future. Expected learning outcomes: Understanding the process of entrepreneurship and technology-based venture development enables case analysts to apply the concepts in many situations involving business opportunities and company development.

TI  - Youth screen use in the ABCD? study
VL  - 57
AB  - Adolescent screen usage is ubiquitous and influences development and
behavior. Longitudinal screen usage data coupled with psychometrically
valid constructs of problematic behaviors can provide insights into
these relationships. We describe methods by which the screen usage
questionnaire was developed in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development (ABCD) Study, demonstrate longitudinal changes in screen
usage via child report and describe data harmonization baseline-year 2.
We further include psychometric analyses of adapted social media and
video game addiction scales completed by youth. Nearly 12,000 children
ages 9-10 years at baseline and their parents were included in the
analyses. The social media addiction questionnaire (SMAQ) showed similar
factor structure and item loadings across sex and race/ethnicities, but
that item intercepts varied across both sex and race/ethnicity. The
videogame addiction questionnaire (VGAQ) demonstrated the same
configural, metric and scalar invariance across racial and ethnic
groups, however differed across sex. Video gaming and online social
activity increased over ages 9/10-11/12 (p's < 0.001). Compared with
boys, girls engaged in greater social media use (p < .001) and
demonstrated higher ratings on the SMAQ (p < .001). Compared with girls,
boys played more video games (p < .001) and demonstrated higher ratings
on the VGAQ (p < .001). Time spent playing video games increased more
steeply for boys than girls from age 9/10-11/12 years (p < .001). Black
youth demonstrated significantly higher SMAQ and VGAQ scores compared to
all other racial/ethnic groups. These data show the importance of
considering different screen modalities beyond total screen use and
