  abstract={In mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), nodes are mobile in nature. Collaboration between mobile nodes is more significant in MANETs, which have as their greatest challenges vulnerabilities to various security attacks and an inability to operate securely while preserving its resources and performing secure routing among nodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective secure routing protocol to protect the nodes from anonymous behaviors. Currently, game theory is a tool that analyzes, formulates and solves selfishness issues. It is seldom applied to detect malicious behavior in networks. It deals, instead, with the strategic and rational behavior of each node. In our study, we used the dynamic Bayesian signaling game to analyze the strategy profile for regular and malicious nodes. This game also revealed the best actions of individual strategies for each node. Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) provides a prominent solution for signaling games to solve incomplete information by combining strategies and payoff of players that constitute equilibrium. Using PBE strategies of nodes are private information of regular and malicious nodes. Regular nodes should be cooperative during routing and update their payoff, while malicious nodes take sophisticated risks by evaluating their risk of being identified to decide when to decline. This approach minimizes the utility of malicious nodes and it motivates better cooperation between nodes by using the reputation system. Regular nodes monitor continuously to evaluate their neighbors using belief updating systems of the Bayes rule.},

  title={Pedestrian Models for Autonomous Driving Part II: High-Level Models of Human Behavior}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={22},
  number={9},
  pages={5453-5472},
  abstract={Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must share space with pedestrians, both in carriageway cases such as cars at pedestrian crossings and off-carriageway cases such as delivery vehicles navigating through crowds on pedestrianized high-streets. Unlike static obstacles, pedestrians are active agents with complex, interactive motions. Planning AV actions in the presence of pedestrians thus requires modelling of their probable future behavior as well as detecting and tracking them. This narrative review article is Part II of a pair, together surveying the current technology stack involved in this process, organising recent research into a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from low-level image detection to high-level psychological models, from the perspective of an AV designer. This self-contained Part II covers the higher levels of this stack, consisting of models of pedestrian behavior, from prediction of individual pedestrians' likely destinations and paths, to game-theoretic models of interactions between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles. This survey clearly shows that, although there are good models for optimal walking behavior, high-level psychological and social modelling of pedestrian behavior still remains an open research question that requires many conceptual issues to be clarified. Early work has been done on descriptive and qualitative models of behavior, but much work is still needed to translate them into quantitative algorithms for practical AV control.},

  abstract={Serious games for safety education (SGSE) are a novel tool for preparing people to prevent and\or handle risky situations. Although several SGSE have been developed, design and evaluation methods for SGSE need to be better grounded in and guided by safety-relevant psychological theories. In particular, this paper focuses on threat appeals and the assessment of variables, such as safety locus of control, that influence human behavior in real risky situations. It illustrates how we took into account such models in the design and evaluation of “Learn to Brace”, a first-of-its-kind serious game that deals with a major problem in aviation safety, i.e. the scarce effectiveness of the safety cards used by airlines. The study considered a sample of 48 users: half of them received instructions about the brace position through the serious game, the other half through a traditional safety card pictorial. Results showed that the serious game was much more effective than the traditional instructions both in terms of learning and of changing safety-relevant perceptions, especially safety locus of control and recommendation perception.},

  pages={1269-1277},
  abstract={Individuals with cognitive impairments are evaluated using clinically validated cognitive assessment tools, which need to be administered by trained therapists. This serves as a major barrier for frequent and longitudinal monitoring of patients' cognitive impairment level. We introduce Neuro-World, a set of six mobile games designed to challenge visuospatial short-term memory and selective attention, which allows one to self-administer the assessment of his/her cognitive impairment level. Game performance is analyzed to estimate a widely accepted clinical measure, the mini mental state examination (MMSE), which highlights the translational impact of the system in real-world settings. We collected game-specific performance data from 12 post-stroke patients at baseline and a three-month follow-up, which were used to train supervised machine learning models to estimate the corresponding MMSE scores. The results presented herein show that the proposed approach can estimate the MMSE scores with a normalized root mean square error of 5.75%. We also validate the system's responsiveness to longitudinal changes in cognitive impairment level and demonstrate the system's positive usability in cognitively impaired individuals and their willingness to adhere to the longitudinal use. This study demonstrates that Neuroworld has great potential to be used to evaluate the cognitive impairment level and monitor its long-term change. This study enables new clinical and research opportunities for accurate, longitudinal assessment of cognitive function via mobile games.},

  pages={4072-4080},
  abstract={The explosive growth of Internet of things (IoT) devices has promoted the prosperity of virtual reality applications, which can be realized by service offloading with the assistance of pervasive edge computing (PEC) platforms. However, owing to the limited computational and communication resources of PEC systems, it is necessary to design a novel resource management algorithm. In this study, we adopt cooperative bargaining theory to design our PEC resource allocation scheme. According to the concept of unification bargaining solution, different bargaining ideas are reciprocally combined to provide a fair-efficient solution. By coordinating network agents, we can leverage mutual consensus and approximate a well-balanced system performance among conflicting requirements. It is essential to explore the relevant trade-off between efficiency and fairness. To effectively share the PEC resources, the main novelty of our approach is its adaptability and flexibility to respond dynamic PEC system environments. Finally, extensive simulations are carried out, and the numerical results demonstrate that our unified bargaining method can obtain desirable features while maximizing the offloading service performance by comparing the existing state-of-the-art PEC control protocols.},

  abstract={This article proposes a blockchain and non-cooperative game theoretic-based secure and optimized data pricing scheme, i.e.,Block-CPS. It aims to secure the data transactions between vehicle owners and customers for rides. It uses the fifth-generation (5G) communication network that offers ultrareliable low-latency communications between vehicle owners and customers. The Interplanetary file system (IPFS) storage protocol used in the proposal reduces the blockchain data storage cost. We then formulated a non-cooperative game-theoretic approach to maximize the profits for vehicle owners and customers. Formulated non-cooperative game is integrated with blockchain to provide security to the Block-CPS. The vulnerability of the developed smart contract is verified and validated using tools like smartcheck and verisol. The performance of Block-CPS is evaluated by comparing it with the traditional approaches using blockchain with 4G and LTE-A networks. The performance evaluation parameters used are system scalability, network latency, data storage cost and its computation, network throughput, profit, communication reliability, and convergence for the optimal payoff between vehicle owners and customers. The performance results shows the Block-CPS outperforms the traditional blockchain-based systems.},

  pages={48059-48068},
  abstract={The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) paradigm provides pervasive healthcare services in-home monitoring networks. Nowadays, these services play an imperative part in the life of human beings. However, excessive requirements of health services result in insufficient spectrum resources and service delays. In this study, a novel spectrum allocation scheme is proposed for the IoMT system platform. The main challenge of our scheme is to effectively share the limited spectrum resource while dynamically handling different service requests. To achieve a mutually desirable solution for multiple IoMT devices, our proposed scheme is designed as a bi-level control algorithm using the ideas of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and the Balakrishnan-G  $\acute {o}$  mez-Vohra (BGV) solution. At the first level, each IoMT device selects its salient point according to the MARL model. At the second level, the spectrum resource is distributed through the BGV solution, which is implemented by considering the selected salient point of each device. Through the sequential interactions of intelligent devices, our bi-level control approach can effectively guide individual IoMT devices to choose cooperation strategies while optimizing the spectrum allocation process. Finally, numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme through the comparisons with benchmark protocols. We demonstrate the performance improvement of our method in terms of the normalized device payoff, IoMT system throughput and device fairness.},

  pages={2795-2808},
  abstract={Mobile-edge cloud computing is a new paradigm to provide cloud computing capabilities at the edge of pervasive radio access networks in close proximity to mobile users. In this paper, we first study the multi-user computation offloading problem for mobile-edge cloud computing in a multi-channel wireless interference environment. We show that it is NP-hard to compute a centralized optimal solution, and hence adopt a game theoretic approach for achieving efficient computation offloading in a distributed manner. We formulate the distributed computation offloading decision making problem among mobile device users as a multi-user computation offloading game. We analyze the structural property of the game and show that the game admits a Nash equilibrium and possesses the finite improvement property. We then design a distributed computation offloading algorithm that can achieve a Nash equilibrium, derive the upper bound of the convergence time, and quantify its efficiency ratio over the centralized optimal solutions in terms of two important performance metrics. We further extend our study to the scenario of multi-user computation offloading in the multi-channel wireless contention environment. Numerical results corroborate that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior computation offloading performance and scale well as the user size increases.},

  pages={8259-8278},
  abstract={This article studies distributed computing (DC) mechanisms on heterogeneous mobile devices (MDs) for latency reduction (LR) in Internet-of-Things (IoT) services by mitigating the effect of straggling MDs. We propose novel coded DC mechanisms with two different incentive distributions that consider the time-discounting value of processed results and the amount of the workload computed by MDs. Specifically, we consider distributed gradient descent computing with coding when a task publisher (TP) with a limited amount of budget offers incentives to encourage MDs' participation in the computation. To analyze a hierarchical decision-making structure of the TP and MDs, we formulate a strategic competition between them as a Stackelberg game. In the case that the MDs are the leaders, we design a CPU-cycle frequency control scheme to balance each MD's computing speed and energy consumption for obtaining its maximum utility with the incentive mechanisms. As the follower, the TP aims at minimizing latency of the DC, and it follows the MDs' decisions to determine the load allocation for each MD. Then, we design an algorithm achieving the Stackelberg equilibrium, which is shown to be a unique Nash equilibrium of the game. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed mechanisms achieve 39% of LR on average compared to the benchmark mechanism. Furthermore, the results corroborate the efficiency of the proposed mechanisms in terms of the MDs' social welfare.},

  pages={222876-222889},
  abstract={Mobile serious games are very important tools for self-learning, training, and edutainment. They can be used to improve the children's learning skills to grasp new concepts rapidly in an enjoyable manner. Fun, motivation, and engagement are the most important features in designing attractive serious games. Therefore, designers should always find the best strategies and techniques to keep children playing the game with motivation and enthusiasm. The process is very long and requires different expertise from all the stakeholders. Arcade games are the most played games for fun and amusement in the last decades. Their approach is based on simplicity, easiness, repetitiveness, and soft challenges. The players of arcade games need only to improve their scores in every episode and avoid frustration and hard challenges as in other games. Hence, this arcade-based approach can be used in designing attractive serious games for young children and adolescents. We propose in this research a new serious game for diabetic children to teach them about the disease in a very easy manner. The game uses the arcade approach coupled with useful information about diabetes where the children discover them incrementally during the play. The longer time the child spends on the game, the most she/he can learn and enhance her/his knowledge on the disease. The game success came from its design and implementation with the presence of diabetes children, advisors, and nutritionists. We compare the game with the well-known DEX pet-based game for diabetes awareness on different aspects including user experience, usability, and learning outcomes. The study is conducted on twenty children from a diabetes camp who accepted voluntarily to participate in this research. We evaluate their educational aspects, using an improved version of the MEEGA+ model. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed game in enhancing the children knowledge on diabetes and adopt a new healthy lifestyle.},

  pages={5571-5583},
  abstract={In this study we consider the scenario of sensors belonging to different platforms and owned by different owners that join the efforts in an opportunistic way to improve the overall sensing capabilities in a given geographical area by forming clusters of nodes. The considered nodes have cognitive radio and exploit device-to-device communications. A solution is proposed which relies on a Cluster Head (CH) that guides the whole task allocation strategy. The addressed challenges are the following: i) collaborative spectrum sensing for effective communications within the cluster; ii) assignment of each request of sensing tasks to a single node in the cluster. The first challenge is addressed by proposing a collaborative sensing procedure where each node communicates to the CH the received signal energy of licensed users so that the latter makes a decision on the availability of the band by fusing the received information towards a minimisation of the uncertainty in detecting the free spectrum. The second challenge is addressed by proposing a non-cooperative Game theory based approach in which cluster nodes make effort to selfishly increase utility by winning the task. Each node takes part to the competition by considering two elements: the gain that is won for its contribution to sensing and for the execution of the task (in case it wins the competition); the cost in terms of energy to be consumed in case the task is executed. A Nash Equilibrium Point (NEP) is found for the aforementioned game in which each object has no incentive to deviate uni-laterally from the NEP. Extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the impact of probability of false alarm, utility function weighting factors and presence of licensed users on the cumulative system utility.},

  abstract={Most congestion control schemes are based on user cooperation, i.e., they implicitly assume that users are willing to share their private information and to take actions such that the network operates efficiently. However, a self-interested and strategic user might exploit such schemes to obtain an individual gain at the expenses of the other users, misrepresenting its private information and overusing the resources. We first quantify the inefficiency of the network in the presence of selfish users for two different scenario: in the complete information case - in which the users have no private information - and in the incomplete information case - in which the users have private information. Then, we ask whether the congestion control scheme can be designed to be robust to self-interested strategic users. To reach this objective, we use an intervention scheme. For the complete information scenario we describe a scheme that is able to give the users an incentive to optimally use the resources. For the incomplete information scenario we describe two schemes that provide the users with an incentive to report truthfully and to use the resources efficiently, although not always optimally. Illustrative results show that the considered schemes can considerably improve the efficiency of the network.},

  abstract={Information-centric networking (ICN) is a novel paradigm that aims at improving the performance of today's Internet by supporting caching and multicast content delivery on every network device. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a centralized strategy to stimulate third parties to jointly lease the unused bandwidth and storage available on wireless access points (APs) in an ICN. We formulate this problem as a combinatorial reverse auction run by a content provider (CP) willing to increase the number of users reached by its service. We show that the optimal allocation with partial coverage problem is NP-hard, provide greedy heuristics that guarantee the individual rationality and truthfulness properties, and compare their performance numerically. We evaluate the benefits of our proposed mechanisms in terms of the cost savings for the CP obtained by offloading its infrastructure through the caches and the reduced computational time to execute the allocation algorithms. We compare the results obtained in this centralized setting with those that can be observed when the mobile clients autonomously choose which AP they prefer to use, among those activated by the auction mechanism. We model this second scenario as a congestion game, showing that it exhibits the desired properties (i.e., existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium) and by comparing its social welfare with the centralized case.},

  pages={4874-4887},
  abstract={Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning framework that can deal with the distributed issue in machine learning and still guarantee high learning performance. However, it is impractical that all users will sacrifice their resources to join the FL algorithm. This motivates us to study the incentive mechanism design for FL. In this paper, we consider a FL system that involves one base station (BS) and multiple mobile users. The mobile users use their own data to train the local machine learning model, and then send the trained models to the BS, which generates the initial model, collects local models and constructs the global model. Then, we formulate the incentive mechanism between the BS and mobile users as an auction game where the BS is an auctioneer and the mobile users are the sellers. In the proposed game, each mobile user submits its bids according to the minimal energy cost that the mobile users experiences in participating in FL. To decide winners in the auction and maximize social welfare, we propose the primal-dual greedy auction mechanism. The proposed mechanism can guarantee three economic properties, namely, truthfulness, individual rationality and efficiency. Finally, numerical results are shown to demonstrate the performance effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.},

  pages={401-415},
  abstract={Distributed interactive computing allows participants at different locations to interact with each other in real time. In this paper, we study the interaction times of continuous Distributed Interactive Applications (DIAs) in which the application states change due to not only user-initiated operations but also time passing. Given the clients and servers of a continuous DIA, its interaction time is directly affected by how the clients are assigned to the servers as well as the simulation time settings of the servers. We formulate the Minimum Interaction Time (MIT) problem as a combinatorial problem of these two tuning knobs and prove that it is NP-hard. We then approximate the problem by fixing the client assignment or the simulation time offsets among the servers. When the client assignment is fixed, we show that finding the minimum achievable interaction time can be reduced to a weighted bipartite matching problem. We further show that this approach establishes a tight approximation factor of 3 to the MIT problem if each client is assigned to its nearest server. When the simulation time offsets among the servers are fixed, we show that finding the minimum achievable interaction time is still NP-hard. This approach can approximate the MIT problem by a factor within 2 if the simulation times of all servers are synchronized. A mix of the above two approaches better approximates the MIT problem within a factor of 5/3. We further conduct experimental evaluation of these approaches with three real Internet latency datasets.},

  volume={21},
  number={5},
  pages={1537-1551},
  abstract={In this paper, a novel management framework for fog computing with strategic computing speed control at fog nodes (FNs) is studied. In the considered model, mobile users declare requests of offloading resource-hungry computation tasks that are dynamically collected at a dedicated edge server (ES). Upon receiving these requests, the ES can decide to either self-process or delegate some workloads to third-party FNs for maximizing the overall management profit. Unlike the existing work, this paper takes into account strategic behaviors of FNs in computing speed control, i.e., each FN can strategically allocate its computing resource to maximize its utility, which consists of the benefit gained from executing offloaded tasks and the cost incurred by dissatisfied (delayed) service to its own subscribed tasks. To jointly address the long-term system performance and FNs&#x2019; strategic interactions, a scheduling mechanism integrating a noncooperative game and a queueing model is formulated. We then investigate two delegation reward settings, i.e., constant and utility-dependent delegation prices, and propose efficient adaptive algorithms to determine the optimal workload distribution at the ES and the computing speed equilibrium among FNs. Both theoretical analyses and simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions and demonstrate their superiorities over counterparts.},

  pages={3193-3208},
  abstract={Building upon the prevailing concept of edge computing (EC), a distributed EC market requires decentralized and verified transaction management to trade computing resources. Towards this goal, we study a blockchain-aided EC market wherein each data service operator (DSO) rents a group of edge computing nodes (ECNs) and leases the ECNs to the user terminals (UTs) to provide computation offloading services. A trustworthiness model is introduced to evaluate the quality of each network entity throughout the transactions. We develop a two-level trading mechanism over smart contract to enable the automatic and efficient transactions among the network entities and provide high quality services. First, we propose a smart contract based matching mechanism to establish the renting association between the DSOs and ECNs with the aim of maximizing the social welfare. Second, we propose a social welfare improved double auction (SWIDA) mechanism to build up the leasing association between the DSOs and UTs, and determine the pricing of the winners. We show that the proposed double auction mechanism can achieve individual rationality, balanced budget, truthfulness in expectation, and an improved social welfare than the benchmark mechanisms. Moreover, we put forth a trustworthiness driven Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to enable verified transaction and fair allocation of block generation reward. Following the principle of PoS, we formulate the block generation as a coalitional game, wherein each stakeholder votes according to its trustworthiness and coinage, and shares the reward among the coalition according to the Shapley values. The simulation results show that the proposed PoS consensus mechanism can reduce the wealth inequality among the network entities compared with the conventional consensus mechanisms.},

  abstract={From its introduction to its quindecennial, network coding has built a strong reputation for enhancing packet recovery and achieving maximum information flow in both wired and wireless networks. Traditional studies focused on optimizing the throughput of the system by proposing elaborate schemes able to reach the network capacity. With the shift toward distributed computing on mobile devices, performance and complexity become both critical factors that affect the efficiency of a coding strategy. Instantly decodable network coding presents itself as a new paradigm in network coding that trades off these two aspects. This paper review instantly decodable network coding schemes by identifying, categorizing, and evaluating various algorithms proposed in the literature. The first part of the manuscript investigates the conventional centralized systems, in which all decisions are carried out by a central unit, e.g., a base-station. In particular, two successful approaches known as the strict and generalized instantly decodable network are compared in terms of reliability, performance, complexity, and packet selection methodology. The second part considers the use of instantly decodable codes in a device-to-device communication network, in which devices speed up the recovery of the missing packets by exchanging network coded packets. Although the performance improvements are directly proportional to the computational complexity increases, numerous successful schemes from both the performance and complexity viewpoints are identified.},

  title={Totally Distributed Energy-Efficient Transmission in MIMO Interference Channels},

  pages={6325-6338},
  abstract={In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels (ICs), subject to the per-link power constraint. To avoid extensive information exchange among all links, the optimization problem is formulated as a noncooperative game, where each link maximizes its own EE. We show that this game always admits a Nash equilibrium (NE) and the sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the NE is derived for the case of large enough maximum transmit power constraint. To reach the NE of this game, we develop a totally distributed EE algorithm, in which each link updates its own transmit covariance matrix in a completely distributed and asynchronous way. Some players may update their solutions more frequently than others or even use the outdated interference information. The sufficient conditions that guarantee the global convergence of the proposed algorithm to the NE of the game have been given as well. We also study the impact of the circuit power consumption on the sum EE performance of the proposed algorithm in the case when the links are separated sufficiently far away. Moreover, the tradeoff between the sum EE and the sum spectral efficiency (SE) is investigated with the proposed algorithm under two special cases: 1) low transmit power constraint regime; and 2) high transmit power constraint regime. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the impact of various system parameters on the system performance.},

  abstract={In this paper, we study the fairness problem in multi-hop wireless backhaul networks in the presence of selfish transit access points (TAPs). We design an incentive-based mechanism which encourages TAPs to forward data for other TAPs, and thus eliminates the location-dependent unfairness problem in the backhaul network. We prove the correctness and truthfulness of the proposed mechanism, and evaluate its performance via ns-2 simulations. The results show that the proposed mechanism achieves fairness even when there are idle TAPs in the network.},

  title={Trusted Cooperation Among Virtual Base Stations in C-RAN},

  abstract={Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has become one of the hot-spot research directions in both industry and academia to facilitate 5G development. Its architecture is mainly divided into three parts: 1) Virtual base station (VBS) pool including a number of base band units that apply for real-time cloud computing technology to carry out digital processing tasks; 2) Remote radio heads (RRH) that are used to collect the wireless signals from all wireless devices; 3) Front-haul network connecting the RRH to the VBS pool. The information of base stations (BS) resides in a centralized VBS pool, multiple operators can allow their VBS pools to exchange control data and cooperate with each other to provide high-quality 5G services. In this process, trustworthy cooperation and platform-trust authentication among multiple mobile operators are required to realize high networking performance and secure 5G environment. However, this topic has been scarcely studies and is still in its infancy. In this paper, we first propose a C-RAN interoperator cooperation scheme (IOCS) to support the cooperation of multiple operators in C-RAN and allow them to share resources in a trustworthy and secure way based on trusted computing platform. An access trust management pool including VBS trust managers is set up in IOCS to administrate an operator's VBS pool. It allows an end user to consume other operators' network resources in a trustworthy manner when its own operator's network cannot satisfy the quality of service requirements. Furthermore, we design a trusted cooperative platform based on OpenStack to implement IOCS. Performance evaluation and simulation results illustrate the high operation efficiency in IOCS comparing with other schemes. Game theoretical analysis shows the condition of inter-operator cooperation by taking operator trust into concern.},

  title={Inducing Genuine Emotions in Simulated Speech-Based Human-Machine Interaction: The NIMITEK Corpus}, 
  year={2010},
  volume={1},
  number={2},
  pages={132-144},
  abstract={Emotional corpora provide an important empirical foundation for investigation when researchers aim at implementing emotion-aware spoken dialog systems. One of the fundamental research questions is how to acquire an appropriate, realistic emotion corpus. The primary aim of this paper is to address the methodological desiderata in producing emotion corpora in human-machine interaction (HMI). It proposes a substantial refinement of the Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) technique in order that a scenario designed to elicit affected speech in HMI could result in realistic and useful data. In addition, the paper reports about the NIMITEK corpus of affected behavior in HMI produced during a refined WOZ simulation. The evaluation of the corpus with respect to the perception of its emotional content demonstrated that the corpus contains recordings of emotions that were overtly signaled. The range of emotional reactions is indicative of the kind of emotional reactions than can be expected to occur in the interaction with the sort of spoken dialog systems considered in this study. Since the subjects were not restricted by given predetermined linguistic constraints on the language to use, their utterances are indicative of the way in which nontrained, nontechnical users probably like to converse with conversational agents as well.},
