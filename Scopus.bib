	abstract = {Background: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) in the United States, and in Washington, District of Columbia (DC), specifically, are disproportionately affected by HIV. Both the national Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative and DC-specific plans emphasize HIV testing, and innovative strategies to encourage testing among AYA are needed. Objective: The purpose of this study is to identify sexual behaviors, HIV knowledge, HIV perceptions (eg, susceptibility and severity), and perceived barriers and facilitators to HIV testing among AYA at risk for HIV in DC. Methods: This study was part of a larger study to determine the acceptability of using a life-and-dating simulation game to increase HIV testing among AYA. Focus groups and surveys stratified by self-reported sexual orientation were conducted among, and administered to, AYA aged 13-24 years in DC. HIV knowledge was explored during focus groups and measured using an adapted version of the Brief HIV Knowledge Questionnaire. Survey data were summarized using descriptive statistics and compared by self-reported sexual orientation. Transcripts were thematically analyzed. Results: Of the 46 AYA who participated in the focus groups, 30 (65%) identified as heterosexual and 16 (35%) as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer. A higher proportion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer AYA reported sexual activity (12/16, 75%, vs 18/30, 60%), condomless sex (11/12, 92%, vs 15/18, 83%), and HIV testing (13/16, 81%, vs 17/29, 58%) than heterosexual AYA. HIV prevention ("condoms" and "...PrEP") and transmission ("exchange of fluids") knowledge was high, and most (34/44, 77%) of the AYA perceived HIV testing as beneficial. However, the AYA also demonstrated some misinformation concerning HIV: an average of 67% (31/46; SD 0.474) of the participants believed that an HIV test could deliver accurate results 1 week after a potential exposure and an average of 72% (33/46; SD 0.455) believed that an HIV vaccine exists. The AYA also identified individual ("...people...are scared"), interpersonal ("it's an awkward conversation"), and structural ("...people don't...know where they can go") barriers to testing. Most of the AYA indicated that they were very likely to use the demonstrated game prototype to help with getting tested for HIV (median 3.0, IQR 2.0-3.0, using a scale ranging from 0 to 3, with 3 indicating high likelihood) and strongly agreed that the game was interesting (median 5.0, IQR 5.0-5.0), fun (median 5.0, IQR 4.0-5.0), and easy to learn (median 5.0, IQR 5.0-5.0, using a scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating strong agreement). Conclusions: These results suggest a need for multilevel HIV testing interventions and informed the development of a mobile health intervention aiming to increase HIV knowledge and risk perception among AYA, while reducing barriers to testing at the individual and structural levels, supporting efforts to end the domestic HIV epidemic. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc.

Since the 2010s, the presence of female playable characters in major studio games began to appear with polarized reception. Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) and Horizon Forbidden West (2022) require players to assume the role of Aloy, a female machine hunter and outcast without a male playable character option. Using Glick and Fiske’s concept of benevolent sexism and the three frames outlined in Schröter and Thon’s video game narrative analysis framework (narrative, ludic, and social), Aloy's narrative was analyzed to highlight how it disrupts amatonormative benevolent sexism in female-led games. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Objective: To establish the usability, acceptability, safety, and exercise adherence of a step training mobile app. Design: A single-arm prospective cohort study. Setting: Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Australia. Subjects: Twenty-six cardiopulmonary rehabilitation participants. Intervention: Twelve weeks of step training using the mobile app Clock Yourself. Participants used Clock Yourself at home and during cardiopulmonary rehabilitation sessions, prescribed for a total of 15-20 minutes three times a week. Main Measures: The primary outcomes of interest were usability and acceptability and were measured using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Attitudes to Falls-Related Interventions Scale (AFRIS) questionnaire, respectively. Safety and adherence were measured by self-report and participant diary, respectively. Secondary outcomes measuring changes in stepping, gait, balance, and physical performance included Manual test of Choice Stepping Reaction Time (CSRT-M), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Gait speed with and without a cognitive dual task (DT) and Timed Up and Go with and without a cognitive DT (TUG and TUGcog). Results: Twenty-one participants completed the study. Clock Yourself was considered highly useable (SUS [median] = 82.5/100; interquartile range [IQR, 67.5-95], equating to an "A"rating [A-F scale]) and acceptable (AFRIS [median] = 38/42 [IQR, 31-41]). Participants practiced Clock Yourself for a median of 18.29 minutes per week and no adverse events were reported. At 12 weeks, mean change in CSRT-M, SPPB, gait speed, DT gait speed, TUG, and TUGcog were all statistically significant (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Twelve weeks of mobile app-based step training was safe and considered usable and acceptable by participants. On average, participants did not meet the prescribed practice dosage. Statistically significant changes were observed in all physical measures; however, results are confounded by participation in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and lack of control group.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) can negatively affect patients' work, education, family, and social and economic activities. Unemployment is a social problem leading to many negative consequences for patients with MS. Therefore, this study aimed to explore lived experiences of MS patients regarding their Return to Work (RTW). Methods: This qualitative study was conducted in Urmia MS Association in Iran. Twelve patients with MS were selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected from July 2019 to March 2020 using semi-structured face-to-face interviews. Data were analyzed using the interpretative phenomenological approach suggested by Dickelman, Allen, and Tanner. Results: Data analysis led to the development of four main themes of "interactive patterns," "supportive system," "challenges," and "stability/volatility." The theme of "interactive patterns" was supported by two sub-themes of " social interaction " and "Social stigma." Four sub-themes of "family support," "workplace support," "MS Association support," and "professional support" formed the theme of "supportive system." The theme of "challenges" was supported by two sub-themes of "individual problems" and "social constraints." The theme of "stability-volatility" was made up of two sub-themes of " adaptative and compatible behaviors " and " non-adaptive and incompatible behaviors." Conclusion: Patients with MS encounter challenges that can have devastating mental, social, and financial health consequences. Meanwhile, healthcare professionals should provide patients with emotional and educational support to help them cope with a changed outlook on life. Employers and policymakers should take practical steps to maintain the employment of these patients for a more extended period to help them better manage their cost of living and treatment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {There is evidence that Iranian preschool children are increasingly spending their time in front of screens (screen time: ST; time spent with any screen such as TVs, computers, tablets, smartphones, game consoles, or video games), but few studies have explored the possible causes of such an increase. Given this, the present study aimed to qualitatively explore determinants of excessive ST in Iranian children. To this end, parents of preschool children were interviewed, and their answers were qualitatively clustered to identify additional important factors. Key informant interviews were conducted with parents of preschool children in Tehran (Iran). A semi-structured interview was developed to assess child and family life, daily routine, family rules, family interactions, and home climate as possible contributing factors to ST. Parents’ audiotaped statements were transcripted verbatim, coded, and clustered into main themes using thematic analysis with the MaxQda® software. A total of 20 parents of children aged 2 to 7 were interviewed, and a total of 6 key themes and 28 subthemes were extracted from their interviews. The results of the analysis identified a broad range of both independent and interrelated factors leading to the development and maintenance of ST behaviors among preschool children. Our findings indicate that the central concept is the family. Considering screen-related behaviors, family life encompasses parental health literacy (e.g., parenting pattern, monitoring standards, thoughtful parenting), family psychological atmosphere (e.g., presence of parents, family norms, parent–parent and parent–child interaction, congruency/incongruency of parents with each other) and the digital structure of the home. The child’s and parents’ actions and characteristics can influence family interactions. A child’s and parent’s behavior is also influenced by social/cultural factors. Parents’ behaviors and attitudes, family communications, and interactions contribute to healthy ST habits in children. It is not possible to examine the child’s behavior without considering the family and the dominant environment, since the behavior of family members as a whole affects each family member. Given this, interventions should make parents aware of their role and responsibilities in reducing children’s ST and consider the family system as a whole, and interventions also can benefit from considering the parental perceptions of children’s behaviors. © 2023 by the authors.},

Objective: This scoping review aimed to portray the use of digital health technology to assist health care providers and family caregivers in caring for patients with cognitive impairment who live in the community or in a facility. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed scientific articles available in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and CINAHL with Full Text, as well as gray literature available in preprint servers, theses depositories, and various national and international dementia organizations’ websites. The search yielded 975 articles, of which we included 7 (0.7%) in the review. Results: Of the 7 interventions included in the retrieved manuscripts, 2 (29%) were digital calendar reminder systems to support activities of daily living and medication management; 2 (29%) were apps on tablet devices to simulate the presence of family before therapy interventions; 1 (14%) was a social robot used in therapeutic sessions to include elements of musicotherapy, reminiscence, cognitive games, and relaxation; 1 (14%) was a commercially available computer system that provides access to various recreational leisure activities; and 1 (14%) was a web-based self-management support system that helps family caregivers to deal with behavior changes in a relative with dementia. Of the 7 articles, only 1 (14%) reported on the use of a behavior change theory, namely a comprehensive process model of engagement coupled with cognitive stimulation therapy. Conclusions: Literature on the topic is scarce, recent, and heterogeneous. There is a clear need for a theoretical framework to conceptualize and govern the use of behavior change models that incorporate technology for patients with cognitive impairment. ©Mohamed-Amine Choukou, Funminiyi Olatoye, Reg Urbanowski, Maurizio Caon, Caroline Monnin.},

	abstract = {Background: Go Nisha Go™ (GNG), is a mobile game combining behavioural science, human-centric design, game-based learning, and interactive storytelling. The model uses a direct-to-consumer (DTC) approach to deliver information, products, services, interactive learning, and agency-building experiences directly to girls. The game’s five episodes focus on issues of menstrual health management, fertility awareness, consent, contraception, and negotiation for delay of marriage and career. The game’s effectiveness on indicators linked to these issues will be measured using an encouragement design in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: A two-arm RCT will be conducted in three cities in India: Patna, Jaipur, and Delhi-NCR. The first arm is the treatment (encouragement) arm (n = 975) where the participants will be encouraged to download and play the game, and the second arm (n = 975) where the participants will not receive any nudges/encouragement to play the game. They may or may not have access to the game. After the baseline recruitment, participants will be randomly assigned to these two arms across the three locations. Participants of the treatment/encouragement arm will receive continuous support as part of the encouragement design to adopt, install the game from the Google Play Store at no cost, and play all levels on their Android devices. The encouragement activity will continue for ten weeks, during which participants will receive creative messages via weekly phone calls and WhatsApp messages. We will conduct the follow-up survey with all the participants (n = 1950) from the baseline survey after ten weeks of exposure. We will conduct 60 in-depth qualitative interviews (20 at each location) with a sub-sample of the participants from the encouragement arm to augment the quantitative surveys. Discussion: Following pre-testing of survey tools for feasibility of methodologies, we will recruit participants, randomize, collect baseline data, execute the encouragement design, and conduct the follow-up survey with eligible adolescents as written in the study protocol. Our study will add insights for the implementation of an encouragement design in RCTs with adolescent girls in the spectrum of game-based learning on sexual and reproductive health in India. Our study will provide evidence to support the outcome evaluation of the digital mobile game app, GNG. To our knowledge this is the first ever outcome evaluation study for a game-based application, and this study is expected to facilitate scalability of a direct-to-consumer approach to improve adolescent sexual and reproductive health outcomes in India.

	abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. Persistent infection with HPV can cause various cancers; however, HPV vaccination can prevent infections associated with high risk, cancerous strains of the virus. As it relates to HPV, college age men have been identified as one of the catch-up vaccination groups. Among college age men, gaming is an extremely popular extracurricular activity. Further, video games have emerged as a popular public health intervention tool. Therefore, this study aims to collect qualitative data on how to develop, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a gaming intervention to increase HPV risk perceptions, improve self-efficacy and increase intention to receive the HPV vaccine among male college students (18-26 years old). Methods: Four focus group sessions ranging from eight to ten individuals were conducted among male college students from one large research-intensive university in the South. Using grounded theory, data from focus group interviews were coded using NVivo software to identify emergent themes. Results: Participants emphasized that although customization was not viewed as important by college aged males, the ability to tailor in game experiences or experience different things each time they played (creative freedom) was more important. They encouraged that the digital game be created on a mobile platform, incorporate health messages, and be informative to reach their population. Furthermore, they suggested innovative way to disseminate the game, which included having health department/health care providers prescribe the game to patients as an end of clinical interaction strategy. Conclusions: College age men, are natural avid gamers, enjoy game play, and can engage in learning online or offline. While platform preference varies among gamer type, college age men in our study emphasized that mobile based gaming is the most advantageous way to increase knowledge/awareness and encourage positive in game behavior which can impact out of game behaviors such as vaccination. Because of the level of access and natural disposition of mHealth technology seen as an "extension of the self", games for health developers should consider the mobile platform as the ideal for the target demographic. © mHealth.

Several studies have shown a high prevalence of psychotic episodes in ASD, leading many authors to hypothesize that patients with neurodevelopmental disorders may have a substantial vulnerability to psychosis. In this paper, the authors describe the clinical case of a 19-year-old male showing social withdrawal and subthreshold persecutory ideas undergoing his first psychiatric evaluation. The patient´s psychomotor development was unremarkable except for a slight speech delay. He has always exhibited introverted tendencies and became increasingly reserved during adolescence. Today, he experiences significant anxiety around his peers and prefers remaining indoors, spending most of the time playing on his smartphone or online games. The diagnostic challenge for clinicians lies in distinguishing between co-occurring disorders or determining whether the clinical manifestations are solely due to one of the conditions. © Copyright by Pacini Editore Srl.},

	abstract = {The emergence, development, and maintenance of gaming disorder (GD) is the result of an interplay between gaming-related factors, individual factors, and environmental factors. None of these alone are sufficient to cause a disordered state, but it is the interactive co-occurrence of all these factors, which in some cases leads to GD. The goal of the present paper is to discuss in detail these three factors based on relevant and recent findings of the literature. Among gaming-related factors, we discuss online vs. offline videogames, the role of game genres, structural characteristics, game design elements, as well as some important monetization techniques. Among individual factors demographic risk factors, personality traits, motivational factors, comorbid psychopathology, genetic predisposition, and neurobiological processes are considered. Finally, among environmental factors we discuss family factors, early life experiences, the role of peers and school-related factors, as well as the broader context of culture including the popularity of esports. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Young people are disproportionately more likely than other age groups to use substances. The rise in substance use and related harms, including overdose, during the Covid-19 pandemic has created a critical need for more innovative and accessible substance use interventions. Digital interventions have shown effectiveness and can provide more engaging, less stigmatizing, and accessible interventions that meet the needs of young people. This review provides an overview of recent literature on the nature of recently published digital interventions for young people in terms of technologies used, substances targeted, intended outcomes and theoretical or therapeutic models employed. Methods: Rapid review methodology was used to identify and assess the literature on digital interventions for young people. An initial keyword search was conducted using MEDLINE the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) and PROSPERO for the years 2015–2020, and later updated to December 2021. Following a title/abstract and full-text screening of articles, and consensus decision on study inclusion, the data extraction process proceeded using an extraction grid developed for the study. Data synthesis relied on an adapted conceptual framework by Stockings, et al. that involved a three-level treatment spectrum for youth substance use (prevention, early intervention, and treatment) for any type of substance. Results: In total, the review identified 43 articles describing 39 different digital interventions. Most were early interventions (n = 28), followed by prevention interventions (n = 6) and treatment interventions (n = 5). The identified digital technologies included web-based (n = 14), game-based (n = 10), mobile-based (n = 7), and computer-based (n = 5) technologies, and virtual reality (n = 3). Most interventions targeted alcohol use (n = 20) followed by tobacco/nicotine (n = 5), cannabis (n = 2), opioids (n = 2), ketamine (1) and multiple, or any substances (n = 9). Most interventions used a personalized or normative feedback approach and aimed to effect behaviour change as the intended outcome. Interestingly, a harm reduction approach guided only one of the 39 interventions. Conclusions: While web-based interventions represented the most common type of technology, more recently developed immersive and interactive technologies such as virtual reality and game-based interventions call for further exploration. Digital interventions focused mainly on alcohol use, reflecting less concern for tobacco, cannabis, co-occurring substance use, and illicit drug use. Specifically, the recent exacerbation in the opioid crisis throughout North American underlines the urgent need for more prevention-oriented digital interventions for opioid use. The uptake of digital interventions among youth also depends on the incorporation of harm reduction approaches. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: Engagement is essential to achieve intended outcomes of online interventions, but achieving such engagement is a key challenge for many researchers and practitioners. This systematic literature review aims to identify strategies and tools to promote the use of online health interventions for early detection and raising awareness of chronic diseases among the public, and to investigate the evidence regarding the effectiveness of such strategies. Materials and methods: We performed a systematic search of seven electronic databases: Embase, Medline All Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Google Scholar. The study protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020200471). Results: The database search identified 8,526 articles, 47 were included in the review. Thirty-two studies reported strategies to promote the use of their online intervention, including online advertisements on social media (n = 17), a dating application (n = 10), and a website (n = 3). Social media were not only used for promotion of the intervention, but also as main intervention platform (n = 18). Seven studies reported traditional promotion methods such as printed advertisement and (offline) campaigns. Twenty-seven studies reported strategies to keep users engaged, including reminders (n = 12), sharing of posts on social media (n = 4), rewards (n = 3), weekly group discussions (n = 2), follow-up phone calls (n = 2), interactive games (n = 1), monthly quizzes (n = 1), links to provision of a test kit (n = 1), and a deposit-return system (n = 1). Conclusions: No study conducted a formal evaluation of the effectiveness of the engagement strategies. Examining the effectiveness of engagement strategies is an important area for further research. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Introduction There is ongoing interest in the development of technical and nontechnical skills in healthcare to improve safety and efficiency; however, barriers to developing and delivering related training programs make them difficult to implement. Unique approaches to training such as "serious games"may offer ways to motivate teams, reinforce skill acquisition, and promote teamwork. Given increased challenges to teamwork in robotic-assisted surgery (RAS), researchers aimed to develop the "RAS Olympics,"a game-based educational competition to improve skills needed to successfully perform RAS. Methods This pilot study was conducted at an academic medical center in Southern California. Robotic-assisted surgery staff were invited to participate in the "RAS Olympics"to develop their skills and identify opportunities to improve processes. Impact of the activity was assessed using surveys and debriefs. Results Sixteen operating room team members participated and reacted favorably toward the RAS-Olympics (average score, 4.5/5). They enjoyed the activity, would recommend all staff participate, felt that it was relevant to their work, and believed that they practiced and learned new techniques that would improve their practice. Confidence in skills remained unchanged. Participants preferred the RAS Olympics to traditional training because it provided an interactive learning environment. Conclusions The successful implementation of the RAS Olympics provided insight into new opportunities to engage surgical staff members while also training technical and nontechnical skills. Furthermore, this shared experience allowed surgical staff members to gain a greater appreciation for their teammates and an understanding of the current challenges and methods to improve teamwork and communication while promoting safety and efficiency in RAS.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

	abstract = {Background: Evidence suggests that lifestyle activities impact cognitive and mental health in older populations. However, how lifestyle factors are associated with one another, and which factors are most important for cognitive function and mental health has received comparatively little attention. Design: Bayesian-Gaussian network analysis was used to investigate unique associations between mental activities (MA; i.e., activities involving cognitive engagement), global cognition, and depression at three time-points in a large sample of older adults (baseline, 2 years, and 4 years follow-up). Setting: This study used longitudinal data from participants living in Australia and participating in the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study. Participants: The sample included 998 participants (55% female) aged between 70 and 90, without a diagnosis of dementia at baseline. Measurements: Neuropsychological assessment of global cognition, self-reported depressive symptoms, and self-reported information about daily MA. Results: Cognitive functioning was positively associated with playing tabletop games and using the internet in both sexes at all time-points. MA were differentially linked in men and women. Depression was not consistently associated with MA in men across the three time-points; women who visited artistic events consistently had lower depression scores. Conclusions: Engaging with tabletop games and using the internet was associated with better cognition in both sexes, however sex acted as a modifier for other associations. These findings are useful for future investigations that consider interactive associations between MA, cognition, and mental health in older adults, and their possible roles in promoting healthy aging. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {(1) Background: Throughout the history of medical and psychology practice, specialists have worked to improve the quality of treatment and rehabilitation, which has led to the emergence of concepts such as serious games. These tools focus on different areas of intervention procedures, one of which is to help people with intellectual disability (ID). Individuals with ID have problems with executive functions (EFs), which are related to adaptive functioning. Recent studies showed that serious games positively impact cognitive, social, and communication skills in people with ID. The purpose of this study is to analyze the solutions that have been found in EF training for adults with ID in recent years, evaluating them with a number of key parameters and identifying the features and possible problems in the further development of our system. (2) Methods: A review was conducted starting with 573 articles in English related to serious games and selected from studies that had been published since 2015. Finally, 10 were examined in detail as they focused on EFs in adults with ID. They were searched in seven major databases (“Association for Computing Machinery” (ACM), IEEE Xplore database, DBLP computer science bibliography, Google Scholar, PubMed, SCOPUS, and PsycInfo). (3) Results: It was determined that the most frequent EFs referred to in the studies analyzed were planning and decision-making, followed by working memory and social cognition, behavioral regulation, flexibility, and inhibition capacity. The basic approach to the creation of support systems was also analyzed in terms of technical and program execution. The trend results’ analysis evidenced improvements in EFs, even though they were not significant. This comprehensive technique enabled the identification of the main features and aspects to be taken into account for further development of our system. © 2022 by the authors.},

Toxicity is an important topic as it impacts game development, consumption, popularity, public perception, and player health and well-being. Most of the existing literature on toxicity in gaming is descriptive and exploratory; it often sets out to map milestones and inherent drivers of toxicity. In this article, an alternative perspective is advanced, drawing from a foundation in media and culture studies. Data (streaming online chat, user-generated content, and forum discussions) were collected daily for 4 weeks from Twitch.tv and Steam channels about the popular online game DOTA 2. Results were processed with a content analysis relying on the driving concepts of toxicity and social affordance. The case study and related platforms were selected for their relevance and pertinence with the theme addressed. Findings point to peculiar interactive patterns in framing, supporting, and overturning toxicity and resulting harassment in these extended settings. Implications are noteworthy for scholars and practitioners who intend to shed light on how diffused audiences negotiate toxicity in digital gaming and beyond. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Importance: Despite high use of smartphones among adolescents, little is known about the association of smartphone use with body image and related behaviors. Objective: To examine the associations of duration of smartphone use and types of content most frequently accessed via smartphone with body image distortion and weight loss behaviors in adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the population-based Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey 2017. Participants comprised a nationally representative sample of 53 133 Korean adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. Data were collected from June 1 to July 18, 2017. The analysis was performed from February 7, 2020, to March 30, 2022. Exposures: Self-reported duration of smartphone use (min/d) and types of content (educational or informational searches; chatting, messaging, or email; social networking services or forums; games; videos, movies, or music; webtoons or web novels; and shopping or other activities) most frequently accessed during smartphone use. Main Outcomes and Measures: Body image distortion (overperception of body weight), weight loss attempt, use of inappropriate weight loss strategies (skipping meals, eating only 1 food at a time, vomiting, or using laxatives), and healthy weight loss behaviors (muscle-strengthening and aerobic physical activity). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, accounting for survey sampling and adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Among 53133 participants, the mean (SD) age was 15.0 (1.8) years; 50.7% of participants were female, and 49.3% were male. After adjusting for types of content accessed, prolonged smartphone use (≥301 min/d) was positively associated with body image distortion (boys: OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.28; girls: OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10-1.30) and inappropriate weight loss strategies (boys: OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.25-1.90; girls: OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 2.14-2.79) in both sexes compared with minimal smartphone use (1-120 min/d). After adjusting for duration of smartphone use, the use of smartphones mainly for videos, movies, or music (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29), webtoons or web novels (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48), and games (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.32) was positively associated with body image distortion in boys compared with the use of smartphones mainly for educational or informational content. Among boys, the use of smartphones mainly for chatting, messaging, or email was positively associated with muscle-strengthening activity (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.18-1.44) and aerobic physical activity (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.29-1.55), as was the use of smartphones mainly for social networking services or forums (muscle-strengthening activity: OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.13-1.42; aerobic physical activity: OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.15-1.43). Among girls, the use of smartphones mainly for chatting, messaging, or email was positively associated with weight loss attempts (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.19-1.51) and the use of inappropriate weight loss strategies (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.25-1.99), as was the use of smartphones mainly for social networking services or forums (weight loss attempts: OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.07-1.36; use of inappropriate weight loss strategies: OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.08-1.73). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, both the duration of smartphone use and the types of content most frequently accessed via smartphone were associated with body image distortion and weight loss behaviors in adolescents. These findings suggest a need for the identification of strategies to help adolescents develop healthy smartphone use behaviors.. © 2022 Acoustical Society of America. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Context: Researchers conducting studies about sport-related concussion (SRC) reporting behaviors and reasons for nondisclosure primarily focus on older athletic populations. Youth athletes participating in contact sports are also at risk for SRC; however, little is known about their SRC disclosure patterns and reasons for nondisclosure. Objective: To examine the self-reported SRC history and reasons for SRC nondisclosure of youth athletes aged 8-14 years. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Youth athletes in organized football, ice hockey, lacrosse, or soccer. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 411 youth athletes (boys = 70.0% [n = 287/410]; median age = 11 [interquartile range = 10-13] years). Main Outcome Measure(s): A 15-minute survey including self-reported demographics, diagnosed and nondisclosed SRC history, and reasons for nondisclosure of suspected SRCs. Results: Ten percent of respondents (n = 41/411) recounted ≥ 1 diagnosed SRC, 12.7% (n = 52/411) did not report a suspected SRC, 13.1% (n = 53/404) indicated they continued to practice, and 12.3% (n=50/406) reported they continued to play in a game after a suspected SRC. Significant associations between sport and nondisclosure existed (P values < .001) but not with self-reported concussion history (P = .14). In sexcomparable analyses, boys' lacrosse players had a higher frequency of nondisclosure than girls (P = .05). The most common reasons for nondisclosure were not wanting to lose playing time (66.7%, n = 32/48), miss a game (56.3%, n = 27/ 48), and let the team down (43.8%, n = 21/48) and uncertainty over injury severity and the presence of SRC (43.8%, n=21/48). Conclusions: Ten percent of youth athletes self-reported at least 1 diagnosed SRC. However, they also described continuing to practice or play in a game after a suspected SRC. Reasons for nondisclosure at this age were similar to those reported in high school and collegiate athletes. Recent researchers suggested negative consequences of continued play with SRC, especially in the acute stages. Anyone conducting future educational initiatives should emphasize these risks and focus on reasons why athletes of both sexes withhold reporting. © 2022 National Athletic Trainers' Association Inc..

	abstract = {While the role of computational thinking (CT) has been widely reported in technology applications and further integrated into interdisciplinary learning, the integration of pedagogy-supported interdisciplinary activities for the empowerment of girls’ learning must not solely emphasise CT problem-solving skills. Rather, it must scaffold them with interactive learning that supports their characteristics while catering to gender equality. In this study, a gender-balanced interdisciplinary activity, integrating CT with Mandarin learning (ML), was designed for an elementary school in the Mandarin as a Second Language learning context using Social Robots (SRs). It sought to verify the results of the proposed method along with focused activities and interaction in an SR-integrated activity on the CT abilities and target-language learning of young learners. A total of 46 Grade 5 students, 26 boys and 20 girls, participated in the experiment. The study used a quasi-experimental method by examining the result of pre- and post-tests on language acquisition, programming self-efficacy, the educational robot attitude, and learning perceptions in the activity. The results indicated that there were no gender differences in terms of ML, self-efficacy in programming, or attitudes toward using SRs in the SR-integrated interdisciplinary activities. However, the boys and girls had different perceptions of learning. Suggestions for conducting SR-integrated interdisciplinary learning are given, along with pedagogical implications for the further promotion of women in technology. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted disease, with the highest infection rates among those sexually active under 25. Although vaccination can reduce HPV cancers among men, public health interventions have primarily targeted females. Increased gaming rates among men provide innovative opportunities to motivate behavior change. This study sought to explore which game development and design strategies are most effective in a game for sexual health, specifically focused on HPV. We also sought to capture information relevant to preferred gaming platforms and game mechanics (health messages, avatars, and visual imagery). Materials and Methods: Twenty-two (n = 22) qualitative interviews were conducted with experts. Using grounded theory, interview data was coded, and emergent themes were identified. Results: Game mechanics most mentioned included simulation/role-playing, social interaction, narrative, and rewards. Experts felt it was important to keep the game in the context of the target audience and integrate the game into an existing game/game scenario or application. Experts also felt the game should link to external resources and enlist partnerships or collaborations with external health agencies. Moreover, while there are benefits to each gaming platform, games on mobile phones and tablets are most appropriate. Conclusion: Digital games are a nonconfrontational approach to discussing HPV and can increase knowledge/awareness and positively influence behavior change toward vaccine uptake. Digital games present a safe environment for role-playing through simulated activities without real-world consequences.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

	abstract = {Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is a sleep disorder in which the habitual sleep–wake timing is delayed, resulting in difficulty in falling asleep and waking up at the desired time. Patients with DSWPD frequently experience fatigue, impaired concentration, sleep deprivation during weekdays, and problems of absenteeism, which may be further complicated by depressive symptoms. DSWPD is typically prevalent during adolescence and young adulthood. Although there are no studies comparing internationally, the prevalence of DSWPD is estimated to be approximately 3% with little racial differences between Caucasians and Asians. The presence of this disorder is associated with various physiological, genetic and psychological as well as behavioral factors. Furthermore, social factors are also involved in the mechanism of DSWPD. Recently, delayed sleep phase and prolonged sleep duration in the young generation have been reported during the period of COVID-19 pandemic-related behavioral restrictions. This phenomenon raises a concern about the risk of a mismatch between their sleep–wake phase and social life that may lead to the development of DSWPD after the removal of these restrictions. Although the typical feature of DSWPD is a delay in circadian rhythms, individuals with DSWPD without having misalignment of objectively measured circadian rhythm markers account for approximately 40% of the cases, wherein the psychological and behavioral characteristics of young people, such as truancy and academic or social troubles, are largely involved in the mechanism of this disorder. Recent studies have shown that DSWPD is frequently comorbid with psychiatric disorders, particularly mood and neurodevelopmental disorders, both of which have a bidirectional association with the pathophysiology of DSWPD. Additionally, patients with DSWPD have a strong tendency toward neuroticism and anxiety, which may result in the aggravation of insomnia symptoms. Therefore, future studies should address the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral approaches in addition to chronobiological approaches in the treatment of DSWPD.

	abstract = {Background: Digital media are pervasive in the lives of young people and provide opportunities for them to learn about STEM. Multiple theories argue that the STEM media environment may shape how youth see a STEM career in their future. Yet, little is known about how pre-college digital media consumption may be related to students’ STEM career interest at the beginning of college. The wide variety of STEM media also raises the question of potentially different effects and pathways by media type. In this study, we collected a nationally representative sample of more than 15,000 students in their first year in U.S. colleges and universities. We asked about their career interests at the beginning of college and also asked them to retrospectively report their STEM media consumption during high school. Results: We found that watching STEM-related TV and online videos, as well as playing STEM-related video games during high school, were positively associated with students’ STEM career interests at the beginning of college. However, we also found that STEM media consumption did not impact directly on STEM career interest, but acted through two intermediaries: STEM identity (I and others see me as a STEM person) and three personal career outcome expectations: a high interest in self-development (enhancement and use of talents), and low interests in material status (money, fame, power) and in interpersonal relationships (helping, and working with, other people). Conclusions: This study finds that STEM media have a significant effect in fostering STEM career interest, with most of the effect coming from STEM TV, STEM video viewing, and STEM video games. The effect is mediated mainly through students’ identity and, to a lesser extent, through personal values, such as self-development, material, and interpersonal relationship values. This study suggests that media communication should be mindful of how different platforms may deliver nuanced and varied messages of what STEM careers may afford and who can succeed in STEM. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Federal law requires state child welfare agencies to respond and provide services to victims of CST. Social workers report lacking an understanding of state and federal law related to human trafficking, as well as resources for victims, and are often inadequately trained for identifying and serving survivors. As part of a CST awareness training including lecture, discussion, and game-based learning, child welfare workers were surveyed on their knowledge about CST and their self-efficacy in serving and engaging with survivors. Regression analyses showed that the training was associated with a positive change from pre- to posttest, on both knowledge (R2 =. 472) and self-efficacy (R2 =.381), even when controlling for gender, race, experience, pretest knowledge, and position. Interactive trainings for child welfare workers on child trafficking survivor engagement that use a victim-centered, strengths-based lens are a promising practice. © 2023 National Association of Social Workers.},

Although children start using educational apps from early age, only a few apps adhere to interaction design recommendations and undergo empirical evaluation of their educational potential. In this paper, we describe the concept and design of an app developed for promoting early math learning through finger-based multi-touch interactions in kindergarten children. Drawing from research on embodied cognition, our app provides games for fostering finger counting as well as finger-based representation of cardinal magnitude and part-whole relations. The app's efficiency was empirically evaluated through a pre-post-intervention study design with two control conditions. Results revealed that a short-term intervention with the math app did not significantly improve children's math skills when compared to learning gains of both a content-matched, unplugged math training program and a passive, waiting list control group. We discuss possible methodological reasons underlying these results, considering key curricular differences for the effectiveness of app-based interventions in early childhood education. Finally, we reflect on the appropriateness of complex multitouch interaction for young kindergarten children and suggest future directions for research in child-centered interaction design. © 2023},

The aim of this review was to consolidate existing strategies for preventing youth violence through technology, providing insights into the current landscape, emerging trends, gaps, and the effectiveness of these strategies. Several databases were searched for evaluation studies of digital interventions specifically designed for children and adolescents up to the age of 18, without imposing any restrictions on the publication dates (e.g., APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo). The methodological quality of the included studies was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The review covered 26 studies, which included a total of 24 distinct digital interventions targeting general aggression (N = 9), bullying and/or cyberbullying (N = 11), and violence in intimate partner relationships (N = 4). These interventions, encompassing interactive games, online activities, and video training, have shown promising potential in preventing youth violence by targeting essential skills such as conflict resolution, emotion regulation, knowledge and awareness, empathy, and self-efficacy. Key areas for the improvement of digital interventions in youth violence prevention involve conducting careful evaluations, refining strategies, and considering cultural factors during intervention design. Also, efforts must be prioritized to ensure their longevity and sustained accessibility. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Reconciling conflicts between wildlife conservation and other human activities is a pervasive, multifaceted issue. Large carnivores, such as the African lion Panthera leo are often the focus of such conflicts as they have significant ecological and cultural value but impose severe social and financial costs on the communities that live alongside them. To effectively manage human–lion conflict, it is vital to understand stakeholder decision-making and preferences regarding mitigation techniques and coexistence strategies. We used a novel experimental game framed around lions and livestock protection, played across eight villages in Tanzania, to examine stakeholder behaviour in response to three incentive structures: support for non-lethal scaring, and individual- and community-level subsidies for provision of wildlife habitat. We found that non-lethal deterrent methods were the preferred mitigation strategy and that individual subsidies most increased the provision of wildlife habitat. Subsidies that were conditional on other community members' decisions were less effective at increasing habitat choices. Player characteristics and attitudes appeared to have little influence on game behaviour. However, there was some evidence that gender, wealth, perceptions of respect, and the behaviour of other players affected decision-making. Achieving success in managing conservation conflicts requires genuine stakeholder participation leading to mutually beneficial results. Our findings suggest that, while incentive-based instruments can promote pro-conservation behaviour, these may be more effective when targeted at individuals rather than groups. We demonstrate how experimental games offer a practical and engaging approach that can be used to explore preferences and encourage discussion of conflict management.

	abstract = {The rapid and ongoing technological developments and the changes in societal practices require us to update our understanding and skills relating to digital technology use continuously. Various frameworks have been created in recent years to explore the different aspects of digital literacies or digital competencies and a range of newer concepts and dimensions have emerged in the literature aiming to capture the complexity of digital engagement. The main aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to map out which elements or issues of critical digital literacies (CDL) relevant for school education currently feature in the academic literature and international policy documents. The secondary aim was to use the findings of the SLR to inform the creation of a research-based framework for school education. The review process followed a systematic protocol for answering specific research questions. Research articles were sought in two electronic databases—EBSCO (Academic Search Complete) and Web of Science—and policy documents were sought on the Internet using Google search. A total of 139 research articles and policy-related documents were used for the analysis. The main dimensions based on the analysis were the following (in the order of most hits): E-safety, Participation and presence, Digital literacy, Media literacy, Digital citizenship, Technology literacy, Information literacy, Data literacy, Digital game literacy, Online learning, Digital creativity and innovation, and Digital well-being. The emphasis in the research articles was on negative issues, although publications also outlined several positive issues about digitality. The emphases of the research articles and policy-related documents differed somewhat. The findings of this SLR have implications for researchers, policy makers and educators interested in the changing nature of critical digital literacies and the dimensions and subdimensions relevant for school education. Context and implications Rationale for the study: This systematic literature review (SLR) identifies the key elements and issues of critical digital literacies (CDL) relevant to school education, as documented in academic literature and international policy documents. In addition, it utilises the findings of the SLR to develop a research-based framework for CLD in school education. Why the new findings matter: Our findings contribute to capturing the different aspects of CDL in the context of compulsory education and offer original insights with regard to supporting the development of teachers and students' critical digital literacies in the future. Implications for researchers, practitioners and policy makers: This SLR has implications for research as it has highlighted the need to continuously update theoretical models and frameworks relating to CDL. Although certain accepted core dimensions can provide a stable foundation for representing emerging phenomena, it is essential to maintain flexibility to address the technological advancements. An implication for policy making is the recognition of the need for continuous professional development and pedagogical support for teachers and students. The value for educational practitioners is that it elucidates the emerging notions of CDL, and it enables educational institutions to enhance their practices and initiatives related to CDL. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: Patients with advanced cancer experience many complicated situations that can make self-advocacy (defined as the ability speak up for yourself in the face of a challenge) difficult. Few self-advocacy interventions exist, and most are atheoretical with minimal patient engagement. The purpose of this study is to describe participant perspectives of a novel, self-advocacy serious game intervention called Strong Together. Methods: This was a qualitative cross-sectional descriptive study among women receiving cancer care at an academic cancer center within 3 months of an advanced gynecologic or breast cancer diagnosis. Participants randomized to receive the intervention completed one-on-one semi-structured interviews 3-months post Strong Together and had the option to share voice journals about their experiences. Inductive qualitative approaches were used to descriptively analyze transcripts and voice journals. Descriptive content analysis approaches were used to group similar codes together into themes summarizing participants’ experiences engaging with the Strong Together intervention. Results: Participants (N = 40) reported that the Strong Together intervention was acceptable, noting that it was realistic and reflective of their personal experiences. Overarching themes included seeing myself in most scenarios and wanting more content; giving me the go ahead to expect more; offering ideas for how to stand up for myself; reinforcing what I am already doing; and reminding me of what I have. Participants suggested adding additional content including diverse characters. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that women with advanced cancer were receptive to a self-advocacy skills-building intervention. Future research should explore the mechanisms linking serious games to learning and health outcomes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To explore perceptions of alcohol and other drug (AOD) education and digital game design preferences among Australian adolescents with the goal of identifying key factors to promote engagement in an AOD serious game for Australian secondary school students. Methods: Semi-structured focus groups were conducted with 36 adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants described heightened engagement with AOD education that incorporated relatable and relevant real-life stories and interactive discussions. They also expressed a desire for learning to focus on practical strategies to reduce AOD harm and overcome social pressure to use AOD. Participants highlighted the importance of incorporating relatable characters and context-relevant scenarios in promoting engagement, and identified social elements, player choice, and optimal challenge as important game design considerations. Conclusions: A focus on meaningful realistic scenarios, relatable characters, relevant information and practical skills may promote high school aged students’ engagement with AOD educational content. Game designs incorporating social elements and decision-making opportunities may be conducive to promoting engagement and enhancing learning. Implications for public health: Findings from this study can be used by researchers and game designers for the development of future AOD serious games targeted at Australian adolescents. © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Using digital addiction as an umbrella term to cover any type of addictions to digital technologies such as the internet, smartphones, social media, or video games, the current study aimed to reveal the intellectual structure and evolution of research addressing digital addiction-depression relationship. Methods: The study combined bibliometric and science mapping analysis methods for this purpose. Data for the study was gathered from Web of Science Core Collection after a comprehensive process of data search/extraction, and 241 articles were included in the final data set. A period-based, comparative science mapping analysis was performed using the SciMAT software. Results: The analysis of data over three periods, Period 1 (1983-2016), Period 2 (2017-2019), and Period 3 (2020-2022) showed that internet addiction was the most significant theme across all three periods, which was followed by social media addiction. Depression, which emerged as a significant theme during Period 1, was later covered under anxiety disorder theme. Research interest was mostly on factors related to both addiction and depression such as cognitive distortion, insomnia, loneliness, self-esteem, social support, alexithymia, as well as cybervictimization or academic performance. Discussion: The results suggested that much research is warranted on the digital addiction-depression relationship in different age cohorts, especially children and elderly. Similarly, the current analysis showed that this line of research particularly focused on internet, gaming and social media addiction, and evidence with regard to other types of digital addiction or related compulsive behaviors was almost absent. In addition, research was mostly inclined to understanding cause-effect relationships, which is significant, but preventive strategies seemed to be barely addressed. Likewise, the smartphone addiction-depression relationship arguably garnered less research interest, so future research would contribute to the field in this respect.

	abstract = {The estimated number of Substance Users (SU) globally has currently reached a very high number and is still increasing. This aspect necessitates appropriate interventions for prevention and specific treatments. The literature shows that digital treatments can be useful in the context of health services and substance abuse. This systematic review focuses mainly on research on the effectiveness of digital treatments for SU. Data sources included studies found on PsycINFO, PubMed, SCOPUS, and WebOfScience (WOS) database searches. The following keywords were used: TITLE (digital OR computer OR software OR tablet OR app OR videogame OR seriousgame OR virtualreality) AND ABSTRACT((mental AND health) AND (addiction OR dependence OR substance OR drug)). We focused on peer-reviewed articles published from 2010 through 2021 using PRISMA guidelines. A total of 18 studies met the inclusion criteria (i.e., type of intervention, efficacy in terms of misuse of substances and scored outcomes from questionnaire or toxicology tests, study methodology). The studies included investigations of specific digital treatments for SU of various kinds of drugs. The interventions were administered using personal computers, smartphones, or, in a few cases, tablets. Most of the interventions focused on the cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) model and/or on the use strategies, tips, or feedback. A minority provided information or training programs. The current review shows that digital treatments and interventions are effective in reducing the frequency of use, augmenting abstinence, or reducing the gravity of dependence for most of the studies at post-treatment. However, due to the heterogeneity of the variables (i.e., substance type, digital tool used, and treatment administered), there was a reduced generalizability of the results. This review highlights the need to continue the research in this field, and above all, to create effective digital protocols. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) has been widely used to simulate various real-like environments suitable to explore and interact, similar to being genuinely there (i.e., allowing presence). User experience in virtual environments (VE) is highly subjective, and presence-based self-reports have addressed its assessment; however, it is unclear how a diverse set of VR features relates to the subscales of the questionnaires (e.g., engagement, immersion, or Attention), which could be helpful to create and improve immersive VE. Consequently, most current studies have appealed to self-defined criteria to design their VE in response to a lack of accepted methodological frameworks. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the current publications to identify critical design elements to promote presence and realistic experiences in VR-games users. We extracted information from different databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, ACM, IEEE, Springer, and Scholar) and used inclusion and exclusion criteria to reduce the original set of 595 candidates to 53 final papers. The findings showed that better quality and quantity in resources allocation (software and hardware) and more accuracy in objects and characters, which all refer to higher immersion, provide Place Illusion (PI), i.e., the spatial dimension of presence. Furthermore, Scenario’s Realism, external stimuli, and coherent match between virtual and real worlds (including body representation) are decisive to set Plausibility Illusion (PSI), i.e., the dimension associated with coherence. Finally, performance feedback, character customization, and multiplayer mechanics are crucial to assure motivation and agency, which are user-exclusive but crucial to defining presence’s perception. Moreover, about 65% of the analyzed studies agreed that immersive media and social interaction could simultaneously influence PI and PSI. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In children and adolescents, risky behaviours such as tobacco use may be addressed by developing life skills. In the field of tobacco prevention, the deployment of playful activities for the development of life skills has received little attention. This review describes the methods and results of tobacco prevention interventions using playful activities to develop life skills in children and preteens. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science and PsycInfo databases. Articles were included in the review based on the following five criteria: (1) the article totally or partially concerns a study of a tobacco prevention intervention; (2) the subjects were children and preteens aged between 6 and 12 years (with an average age within this age range or with an interval including all or part of this age range), from a general or specific population; (3) the intervention was a life skills development action or program; (4) playful activities were employed; (5) design, implementation, evaluation methods and/or results are available in the article. A total of 11 studies, composed of 9 interventions, were included in this systematic review. Most were carried out in school settings (n = 8/11) and involved teachers (n = 7/11). Web-based interventions (video games, mobile health games/websites and e-learning programs) were the playful activities most often used (n = 4/11). The majority of the interventions aimed to develop social skills such as the ability to resist pressure (n = 9/11). In this review, there were only four randomized controlled trial (n = 4/11). The evaluation was immediately after the RCTs. Among the measured outcome variables, knowledge (n = 8/11), attitudes (n = 5/11), intentions (n = 5/11), self-efficacy (n = 4/11) and skills (n = 3/11) were the most assessed. Only two of the studies reviewed here conducted a process evaluation (n = 2/11). This systematic review provides guidance for future youth smoking prevention interventions. Among these, a process evaluation is strongly suggested, as well as the use of appropriate variables and validated scales to assess the effectiveness of prevention programs. In addition, participatory research must allow for the design of adapted and relevant interventions, but also for the proper development of intervention research methodologies in health promotion. © 2023},

	abstract = {Background: Barriers to cervical cancer screening in young adults include a lack of knowledge and negative perceptions of testing. Evidence shows that mobile technology reduces these barriers, thus, we developed a web app, Game-based Learning Avatar-navigated mobile (GLAm), to educate and motivate cervical cancer screening using the Fogg Behavioral Model as a theoretic guide. Users create avatars to navigate the app, answer short quizzes with education about cervical cancer and screening, watch videos of the screening process, and earn digital trophies. Objective: We tested ease of use, usefulness, and satisfaction with the GLAm app among young adults. Methods: This mixed methods study comprised a qualitative think-aloud play interview session and a quantitative survey study. Participants were cervical cancer screening–eligible US residents aged 21 to 29 years recruited through social media. Qualitative study participants explored the app in a think-aloud play session conducted through videoconference. Data were analyzed using directed content analysis to identify themes of ease of use, usefulness, and content satisfaction. Qualitative study participants and additional participants then used the app independently for 1 week and completed a web-based survey (the quantitative study). Ease of use, usefulness, and satisfaction were assessed using the validated Technology Acceptance Model and Computer System Usability Questionnaire adapted to use of an app. Mean (SD) scores (range 1-7) are presented. Results: A total of 23 individuals participated in one or both study components. The mean age was 25.6 years. A majority were cisgender women (21/23, 91%) and White (18/23, 78%), and 83% (19/23) had at least some secondary education. Nine participants completed the think-aloud play session. Direct content analysis showed desire for content that is concise, eases anxiety around screenings, and uses game features (avatars and rewards). Twenty-three individuals completed the quantitative survey study. Mean scores showed the app was perceived to be easy to use (mean score 6.17, SD 0.27) and moderately useful to increase cervical cancer screening knowledge and uptake (mean score 4.94, SD 0.27). Participants were highly satisfied with the app (mean score 6.21, SD 1.20). Conclusions: Survey results showed participants were satisfied with the app format and found it easy to use. The app was perceived to be moderately useful to inform and motivate cervical cancer screening, notably, the screening reminder function was not tested in this study. Qualitative study results demonstrated the app’s ability to ease anxiety about screening through demonstration of the screening process, and brevity of app components was favored. Interpretation of results is limited by the predominantly cisgender, White, and educated study population, additional testing in populations which historically have lower cervical cancer screening uptake is needed. A modified version of the app is undergoing efficacy testing in a randomized clinical trial. © Lindsey J Wanberg, Angela Kim, Rachel I Vogel, Karim Thomas Sadak, Deanna Teoh.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies on problematic Internet use and problematic gaming conducted so far have mainly been carried out with unrepresentative and self-selected convenience samples, resulting in unreliable prevalence rates. This study estimates the prevalence of problematic Internet use and problematic gaming in a large sample of Spanish adolescents (N = 41,507) and identifies risk and protective factors for these risky behaviours. Data were collected online using the Adolescent Problem Internet Use Scale and the Adolescent Gaming Addiction Scale. Using a cut-off approach with measurement instruments inspired by the DSM-5 framework, we found a prevalence of 33% for problematic Internet use and 3.1% for problematic gaming. With a more conservative approach inspired by the ICD-11 framework, prevalence rates decreased to 2.98% for problematic Internet use and 1.8% for problematic gaming. Female gender, higher parents’ education, elevated Internet connection time, reporting being online after midnight and using the mobile phone in class predicted problematic Internet use; whereas male gender, “living situation” where families do not have a traditional structure or stable environment, elevated Internet connection time and reporting using the mobile phone in class predicted problematic gaming. A cut-off approach involving scales that recycle substance use criteria (as in the DSM-5) over-pathologize Internet use and gaming behaviours. In contrast, the ICD-11 approach seems to provide more realistic and reliable prevalence rates. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Visuospatial (VS) skills, or one's ability to mentally manipulate spatial information about objects, are critical to STEM enrollment, retention, and achievement. Low level of VS skills may deter some people from joining the STEM workforce or complicate their learning experience. While there is plenty of evidence suggesting that VS skills can be improved through training, few accessible training programs exist as of now, particularly for younger students. The current study proposes a new direction of VS training focusing on the development of visuospatial self-efficacy (VSSE), or one's confidence that they can complete specific VS tasks. The collaborative, desktop/mobile Virtual Reality game called [hidden for peer review] (available for download at [hidden for peer review]) was designed to improve VSSE in middle school students. A total of 169 students across 11 classrooms in 3 middle schools in a mid-western city in the United States participated in the intervention. The participants in the experimental condition (n=96, 6 classrooms) played the intervention game during 4 sessions over the course of 2 weeks, while the participants in the control condition (n=73, 5 classrooms) engaged in typical class activities. The results revealed that the intervention significantly increased students’ VS self-efficacy but not their VS performance or STEM performance. The implications and significance of the findings are discussed along with suggestions for further research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Harnessing avatars to promote behavioral change and positive outcomes—the concept of avatar-focused gamification—is underexplored within educational contexts. The present research examines the potential for instructional designers to influence students' avatar customization orientation—defined as an individual's psychological approach to creating an avatar—to improve education-related outcomes; namely, student performance, self-efficacy, and growth mindset. Results of a field experiment (N = 170) in an undergraduate course suggest that, unexpectedly, using an ideal-self or future-self avatar, compared to an actual-self avatar, was associated with slightly lower exam scores and self-efficacy, though no association was found with growth mindset. Based on these findings, we suggest that educators encourage their students to customize avatars to represent who they actually are, while researchers should continue to explore other types of avatar customization guidelines that might be beneficial for students. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {An adequate level of reading comprehension is a prerequisite for successful learning. Numerous studies have shown that without a solid foundation, there can be severe difficulties in later learning and that failure in the first years of schooling can determine attitudes to learning. In the present study, we present the effect size of an online game-based training program implemented on eDia. The primary goals of the development program are to develop fluency in reading and reading comprehension in Grades 3–4. The content of the program has been developed in accordance with the national core curriculum and the textbooks based on it. Therefore, it can be integrated into both classroom-based lessons and extracurricular activities outside of class. The quasiexperimental research involved 276 students. Propensity score matching was used in examining the effect size of the development program to increase the validity of the results. Through the training program, the development of students in the intervention group accelerated greatly (d =.51), which proved to be even higher in the lowest and average skill groups (d1 = 1.81; d2 =.92) as well as in the disadvantaged student group (d =.72). Latent-change analyses confirmed the sensitivity, relevance, and importance of developing comprehension at 9–10 years of age and the generalizability of the results (χ2 = 421.5; df = 272; p <.05; CFI =.950; TLI =.945; RMSEA =.045 (CI:.036,.153). The study provided evidence that a well-designed online training program is suitable for developing comprehension and overcoming disadvantages, even without the presence of the teacher outside the classroom. © 2022 by the authors.},

(2) The secondary aims included assessing the perceived social and physical impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on individuals and the different coping strategy practices during this tough period. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and June 2020 in Saudi Arabia. We collected data from both sexes aged 18 years and older using social media. The online questionnaire collected data on their sociodemographic, physical, and social conditions, and the presence and control of chronic diseases as well as their evaluation according to the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21. Results: Of the 878 participants, 56.6% were female, 54.6% were aged between 35 and below, 52.6% were married, and 97.4% had a secondary school and above. Approximately a quarter of the participants or relatives had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Moderate-to-severe depression, anxiety, and stress were reported in 32.6%, 28.7%, and 22.6% of the participants, respectively. The younger than 35 years, unmarried, not working, and the previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were associated with higher scores of depression, anxiety, and stress. In addition, the participants reported several coping strategies such as doing physical exercise, hobbies, chatting over social media, watching TV/movies, playing electronic games, increasing religious prayers, and getting psychosocial help. Conclusion: A quarter of the participants reported a moderate-to-severe psychological impact. They adopted various strategies to reduce the adverse lockdown effect. In a future pandemic, health-care providers and policymakers can focus on potential risk factors and coping strategies to prevent, intervene early, and treat sufferers. © 2022 Journal of Nature and Science of Medicine.

	abstract = {Background Problematic internet use, especially in people with substance use disorder, may negatively affect their quality of life (QoL). However, it is unclear whether sleep quality is a key mediator in the association between problematic internet use and QoL among people with substance use disorder. Aims This study aimed to investigate the relationship between problematic internet use and QoL and how sleep quality may mediate the association between these two variables. Method Overall, 319 people (85% male) with substance use disorder (mean age 42.2 years, s.d. 8.9) participated in a cross-sectional study in Taiwan. The Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale, Bergan Social Media Addiction Scale, Internet Gaming Disorder-Short Form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire Brief Version were used. Results The prevalence of sleep problems was 56%. There were significant and direct associations between sleep quality and two types of problematic internet use, and between sleep quality and different dimensions of QoL. All types of problematic internet use were significantly and negatively correlated with QoL. Mediated effects of sleep quality in relationships between the different types of problematic internet use and all dimensions of QoL were significant, except for problematic use of social media. Conclusions Different types of problematic internet use in people with substance use disorder may be directly associated with reduced QoL. Sleep quality as a significant mediator in this association may be an underlying mechanism to explain pathways between problematic internet use and QoL in this population.

	abstract = {Background: Reliable prediction of postoperative dislocation after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) would inform patient counseling as well as surgical and postoperative decision making. Understanding interactions between multiple risk factors is important to identify those patients most at risk of this rare but costly complication. To better understand these interactions, a game theory–based approach was undertaken to develop machine learning models capable of predicting dislocation-related 90-day readmission following RSA. Material & Methods: A retrospective review of the Nationwide Readmissions Database was performed to identify patients who underwent RSA between 2016 and 2018 with a subsequent readmission for prosthetic dislocation. Of the 74,697 index procedures included in the data set, 740 (1%) experienced a dislocation resulting in hospital readmission within 90 days. Five machine learning algorithms were evaluated for their ability to predict dislocation leading to hospital readmission within 90 days of RSA. Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values were calculated for the top-performing models to quantify the importance of features and understand variable interaction effects, with hierarchical clustering used to identify cohorts of patients with similar risk factor combinations. Results: Of the 5 models evaluated, the extreme gradient boosting algorithm was the most reliable in predicting dislocation (C statistic = 0.71, F2 score = 0.07, recall = 0.84, Brier score = 0.21). SHAP value analysis revealed multifactorial explanations for dislocation risk, with presence of a preoperative humerus fracture; disposition involving discharge or transfer to a skilled nursing facility, intermediate care facility, or other nonroutine facility; and Medicaid as the expected primary payer resulting in strong, positive, and unidirectional effects on increasing dislocation risk. In contrast, factors such as comorbidity burden, index procedure complexity and duration, age, sex, and presence or absence of preoperative glenohumeral osteoarthritis displayed bidirectional influences on risk, indicating potential protective effects for these variables and opportunities for risk mitigation. Hierarchical clustering using SHAP values identified patients with similar risk factor combinations. Conclusion: Machine learning can reliably predict patients at risk for postoperative dislocation resulting in hospital readmission within 90 days of RSA. Although individual risk for dislocation varies significantly based on unique combinations of patient characteristics, SHAP analysis revealed a particularly at-risk cohort consisting of young, male patients with high comorbidity burdens who are indicated for RSA after a humerus fracture. These patients may require additional modifications in postoperative activity, physical therapy, and counseling on risk-reducing measures to prevent early dislocation after RSA. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees},

	abstract = {Background: Children with Down syndrome have poorer functional and sensory skills compared to children with typical development. Virtual reality (VR) training could help improve these skills. Moreover, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has achieved promising results in terms of enhancing the effects of physical and sensory therapy by modulating cortical excitability. Methods/design: Two investigations are proposed: (1) an observational study with a convenience sample consisting of children with Down syndrome (group 1—cognitive age of 6 to 12 years according to the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence) and children with typical development 6 to 12 years of age (group 2). Both groups will undergo evaluations on a single day involving a three-dimensional analysis of upper limb movements, an analysis of muscle activity of the biceps and brachial triceps muscles and an analysis of visuospatial and cognitive-motor variables. (2) Analysis of clinical intervention: a pilot study and clinical trial will be conducted involving individuals with Down syndrome (cognitive age of 6 to 12 years according to the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence). The sample will be defined after conducting a pilot study with the same methodology as that to be used in the main study. The participants will be randomly allocated to two groups: An experimental group submitted to anodal tDCS combined with a VR game and a manual motor task and a control group submitted to sham tDCS combined with a VR game and a manual motor task. The training protocol will involve 10 sessions of active or sham tDCS during memory and motor task games. Three 20-min sessions will be held per week for a total of 10 sessions. Evaluations will be performed on three different occasions: pre-intervention, post-intervention (after 10 sessions) and follow-up (1 month after the intervention). Evaluations will consist of analyses of electroencephalographic signals, electromyographic signals of the biceps and triceps brachii, and the three-dimensional reconstruction of the reaching movement. The results will be analyzed statistically with the significance level set at 5% (p ≤ 0.05). Discussion: The optimization of the results obtained with virtual reality training is believed to be related to the interactive experience with a wide range of activities and scenarios involving multiple sensory channels and the creation of exercises, the intensity of which can be adjusted to the needs of children. Therefore, the proposed study aims to complement the literature with further information on tDCS and VR training considering different variables to provide the scientific community with clinical data on this combination of interventions.

	abstract = {In a standard decision-making model for a game of chance, the best strategy is chosen based on the current state of the system under various conditions. There is however a shortcoming of this standard model, in that it can be applicable only for short-term decision-making periods. This is primarily due to not evaluating the dynamic characteristics and changes in status of the system and the outcomes of nature towards an a priori target or ideal state, which can occur in longer periods. Thus, in this study, a decision-making model based on the concept of stratification (CST), game theory and shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) is developed and its applicability to disaster management is shown. The game of chance and CST have been integrated to incorporate the dynamic nature of the decision environment for long-term disaster risk planning, while accounting for various states of the system and an ideal state. Furthermore, an interactive web application with dynamic user interface is built based on the proposed model to enable decision makers to identify the best choices in their model by a predictive approach. The Monte Carlo simulation is applied to experimentally validate the proposed model. Then, it is demonstrated how this methodology can suitably be applied to obtain ad hoc models, solutions, and analysis in the strategic decision-making process of flooding risk strategy evaluation. The model's applicability is shown in an uncertain real-world decision-making context, considering dynamic nature of socio-economic situations and flooding hazards in the Highland and Argyll Local Plan District in Scotland. The empirical results show that flood forecasting and awareness raising are the two most beneficial mitigation strategies in the region followed by emergency plans/response, planning policies, maintenance, and self help. © 2022},

	abstract = {There has been a proliferation of digital sexual health interventions targeting adolescents; however, limited evaluative reviews have compared the effectiveness of multiple digital tools for sexual health literacy and behaviour change. This study conducted a systematic literature review, screened 9881 records and analysed 61 studies. Findings suggest that websites and mobile phones dominate digital sexual health interventions, with a majority effectively delivering cognitive (e.g. awareness and attitudes about sexual and reproductive health) and behavioural outcomes (e.g. abstinence and use of contraception). The most popular sexual health promotion mechanisms were interactive websites, text messaging and phone calls, and online education programmes, followed by mobile applications - fewer studies in this review utilized social media, games and multimedia. Previous reviews focused on single outcome measures (e.g. sexually transmitted infection testing) to assess interventions' effectiveness. The current review moves beyond single outcome measures to cover a wider range of behavioural and non-behavioural sexual health issues and contexts covered in the literature. Four main categories were analysed as outcomes: cognitive perceptions, promoting sexual health-related behaviours, promoting sexual health-related products and services, and impact (viral load). Seventy-nine per cent of interventions focused on preventive sexual health behaviours and products (e.g. condoms) and services (e.g. HIV testing). Overall, 75% of studies effectively changed sexual health behaviour and cognitive perceptions. However, the digital-only tools did not vary from the blended formats, in influence outcomes, even after categorizing them into behavioural or non-behavioural outcomes. Compared to previous systematic reviews, more studies from the last decade used rigorous research design in the form of randomized controlled trials, non-randomized control trials, and quasi-experiments and lasted longer.  © 2023 The Author(s).

This study aimed to estimate the frequency of a history of probable ADHD in a population of patients with SA and to explore the factors associated with it. Methods: One hundred 85 patients referred to the Nantes University Hospital for SA between 2011 and 2020 were included. Patients completed the Sexual Addiction Screening Test (SAST) or its revised version (SAST-R) to establish the presence of SA. As the SAST-R was not validated in French, we conducted a validation study for the French version. ADHD was screened using the Wender-Utah Rating Scale in childhood and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale in adulthood. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the presence of a history of probable ADHD. Results: Childhood ADHD was identified in 36% of patients with SA. Factors associated with the presence of a history of probable ADHD were a low education level, an earlier age of onset of problematic sexual behaviour, another addictive disorder, an anxiety disorder, impulsivity (high negative urgency score), and high scores on harm avoidance and novelty-seeking temperament scales. Furthermore, the French version of the SAST-R displayed good psychometric properties, especially excellent sensitivity. Conclusion: The frequency of a history of probable ADHD among patients with SA is consistent with the literature and close to the highest range. Specific personality traits in patients with both SA and a history of probable ADHD could induce lasting problems of adaptation, which may precipitate the development of SA or maintain it.  © 2023 S.

	abstract = {Background: The consumption of alcohol and drugs, particularly in adolescents and young adults, has increased worldwide in the last several years, representing a significant public health challenge. Serious games have the potential to support preventive and treatment interventions for substance use, facilitating the acquisition of relevant knowledge and the motivation for changes in attitudes and behaviors regarding substance consumption. Objective: This scoping review aims to analyze a set of 7 relevant characteristics of current serious games designed to support the prevention and treatment of alcohol and drug consumption in adolescents and young adults—the substance addressed, the type of intervention, the theoretical basis, the computational techniques used, the mechanism for data security and privacy, the evaluation procedure followed, and the main results obtained. Methods: The review was performed by following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. Data were retrieved from January 2010 to May 2022, using PubMed, Scopus (Elsevier), IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital as data sources. The eligibility criteria included studies that described serious games designed to support the prevention or treatment of alcohol and drug consumption, targeted a population aged between 12 and 30 years, and included an evaluation procedure. Authors (JMM and IEEC) individually screened the titles and abstracts, and then full articles were reviewed for a final inclusion decision. Results: A total of 629 records were obtained, and 29 (4.6%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most of the serious games (14/29, 48%) were focused on the prevention or treatment of alcohol use. The type of intervention that was the most supported was prevention (18/29, 62%), and most studies mentioned the theory, theoretical construct, or therapeutic technique used as a foundation (22/29, 76%). Most of the studies only provided information about the platform for execution (23/29, 79%), and few described the use of computational techniques, such as virtual reality or motion-based interaction (5/29, 17%). A small set of studies (10/29, 34%) explicitly mentioned how data security and privacy were addressed. Most of the reported evaluation protocols were pilot studies (11/29, 38%), followed by randomized controlled trials (10/29, 34%), and the reported results were positive in terms of acceptability, usability, and efficacy. However, more research is needed to assess long-term effects. Conclusions: Given the increasing interest in the use of serious games as digital interventions to support the prevention or treatment of substance use, knowing their main features is highly important. This review highlights whether and how current serious games incorporate 7 key features that are useful to consider for the further development of the area. © Juan Martínez-Miranda, Ismael Edrein Espinosa-Curiel.},

	abstract = {The skin cancer incidence rate has been rising, and digital health interventions can promote skin cancer prevention and detection behaviors. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the outcomes of digital interventions that promote sun protection and skin self-examination (SSE). This review examined studies that utilized randomized controlled designs or quasi-experiments, included outcomes related to sun safety or SSE, employed at least one digital platform, and were published in English from January 2000 to October 2020. A total of 62 studies were included in the review. Digital modalities included web-based (e.g., websites) alone (n = 29), mobile-based (e.g., mobile apps) alone (n = 12), game-based (n = 1), emails or text messages alone (n = 8), videos alone (n = 6), social media (n = 3), both text messages and mobile apps (n = 2), or both text messages and video (n = 1). Most studies (n = 44) only evaluated sun protection-related outcomes, seven studies assessed SSE outcomes only, nine studies examined both, and two assessed other related outcomes. Digital interventions are effective compared to non-intervention control conditions in promoting sun safety or SSE. Almost all studies found digital interventions to be equally or more effective compared to non-digital interventions. This review suggests that although the digital interventions varied, they showed promising effects on improving sun protection or SSE outcomes. Future research should include more sophisticated phase-based and rigorous longitudinal research designs, additional investigation of social media and other newer technologies, as well as more detailed reporting of methods and results. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: A 4-year longitudinal study was conducted to develop a model and a point system for predicting childhood obesity. Methods: This study included 1,504 Japanese 10-year-old children who underwent health check-ups between 2011 and 2015. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted using the explanatory variables overweight and lifestyle. Obesity was defined as percentage overweight (POW) > 20% calculated by the following equation: (actual weight-standard weight by height and sex)/ standard weight by height and sex © 100 (%). The model was validated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test on 10-year-olds. Results: Our prediction model for development of childhood obesity was based on seven binary variables: sex, lack of sleep, >2-h use of television/ games/ smartphone, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic dysfunction, and being overweight. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.803 (95% confidence interval, 0.740 to 0.866). When validated in non-obese children (n = 415), there was no significant difference between actual and predicted numbers of children with obesity (Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square = 7.90, p = 0.18). Conclusions: The validated prediction model and point score for obesity development were shown to be useful tools for predicting the future 4-year risk of developing obesity among 10 years-old children. The point system may be useful for reducing the occurrence of childhood obesity and promoting better health. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Prediction is critical for successful interactions with a dynamic environment. To test the development of predictive processes over the life span, we designed a suite of interceptive tasks implemented as interactive video games. Four tasks involving interactions with a flying ball with titrated challenge quantified spatiotemporal aspects of prediction. For comparison, reaction time was assessed in a matching task. The experiments were conducted in a museum, where over 400 visitors across all ages participated, and in a laboratory with a focused age group. Results consistently showed that predictive ability improved with age to reach adult level by age 12. In contrast, reaction time continued to decrease into late adolescence. Inter-task correlations revealed that the tasks tested different aspects of predictive processes. This developmental progression complements recent findings on cerebellar and cortical maturation. Additionally, these results can serve as normative data to study predictive processes in individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Background: Despite the proven benefits of exercise in older adults, challenges such as access and motivation can deter their engagement. Interactive virtual reality (VR) games combined with exercise (exergames) are a plausible strategy to encourage physical activity among this population. However, there has been little research on the feasibility, acceptability, and potential benefits of deploying at-home VR exergames among community-dwelling older adults. Objective: The objectives of this study are to estimate the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of a co-designed VR exergame in community-dwelling older adults; examine intervention feasibility and assessment protocols for a future large-scale trial; and provide pilot data on outcomes of interest (physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, mood, cognition, perception, and gameplay metrics). Methods: The study will be a remote, 6-week intervention comprising an experimental and a control group. A sample of at least 12 community-dwelling older adults (with no or mild cognitive impairment) will be recruited for each group. Both groups will follow the same study procedures and assessment methods. However, the experimental group will engage with a co-designed VR exergame (Seas The Day) thrice weekly for approximately 20 minutes using the Oculus Quest 2 (Facebook Reality Labs) VR headset. The control group will read (instead of playing Seas The Day) thrice weekly for approximately 20 minutes over the 6-week period. A mixed methods evaluation will be used. Changes in physical activity, exercise self-efficacy, mood, cognition, and perception will be compared before and after acute data as well as before and after the 6 weeks between the experimental (exergaming) and control (reading) groups. Qualitative data from postintervention focus groups or interviews and informal notes and reports from all participants will be analyzed to assess the feasibility of the study protocol. Qualitative data from the experimental group will also be analyzed to assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of at-home VR exergames and explore perceived facilitators of and barriers to uptaking VR systems among community-dwelling older adults. Results: The screening and recruitment process for the experimental group started in May 2021, and the data collection process will be completed by September 2021. The timeline of the recruitment process for the control group is September 2021 to December 2021. We anticipate an estimated adherence rate of ≥80%. Challenges associated with VR technology and the complexity of remote assessments are expected. Conclusions: This pilot study will provide important information on the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a custom-made VR exergaming intervention to promote older adults’ well-being. Findings from this study will be useful to inform the methodology, design, study procedures, and assessment protocol for future large-scale trials of VR exergames with older adults as well as deepen the understanding of remote deployment and at-home use of VR for exercise in older adults. ©Samira Mehrabi, John E Muñoz, Aysha Basharat, Jennifer Boger, Shi Cao, Michael Barnett-Cowan, Laura E Middleton.},

	abstract = {Objective: to identify real facts about the sexual and reproductive emotional health (SRH) in immigrant women in Barcelona, and their proposals for tools of promotion through a Participatory Action-Research (PAR) process. Method: a qualitative, descriptive-interpretative study, based on PAR, according to the model by Kemmis and McTaggart, and coordinated by a motor group (PARG). The study involved discussion groups and interviews with immigrants and professionals, following a script (SRH concepts, knowledge and experience about contraception and prevention methods, access to resources, and proposals for tools). The narrative content analysis was conducted through ATLAS-Ti. Results: a Motor Group (PARG) was formed with 13 members; 10 discussion groups and three interviews were conducted, with 51 immigrants from multiple origins and 10 professionals. SRH was associated with their culture of origin according to age, gender, marital status, family, religion, and education received. There was lack of knowledge regarding contraception and prevention of sexually-transmitted infections, and about support services for SRH. Interactive tools were suggested, including games, activated by professionals with cultural skills. The school appeared as an important space to work with this tool. Conclusion: the PAR process allowed to identify the realities of immigrant women, as well as specific proposals to promote equity in SRH. © 2022 DAE Editorial, Grupo Paradigma. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The main aim of this study is to explore problematic technology use among adolescents (Internet, video games, mobiles, and television) and its association with anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, we also analysed the possible moderating role of life satisfaction in this relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. A cross-sectional survey of 4025 children and adolescents (52% females and 48% males) between 12 and 18 years old was carried out to explore problematic technology use and its correlation with anxiety and life satisfaction after pandemic lockdown. Four multivariate regressions containing the independent variable (problematic technology use), the moderator (life satisfaction), and their interaction were entered to predict the outcome (anxiety). The moderated models were examined using SPSS PROCESS macro software (Model 1). Analyses showed significant positive correlations with anxiety and negative correlations with life satisfaction regarding problematic technology use (mobile phone, television, and internet). Both gender and age had a significant direct effect on anxiety (showing that women and older participants had the greatest anxiety). In the moderation analysis, when life satisfaction was higher, the presence of anxiety symptoms depended to a greater extent on the problematic use of technology. Our results confirm that problematic technology use is related to higher levels of anxiety in adolescents, with differences by age and gender. The results also showed that life satisfaction mediated the relationship between technology abuse and anxiety, such that when life satisfaction was higher, the presence of anxiety symptoms was more dependent on problematic technology use. These findings have implications for health and education professionals. © 2022 The Authors. International Journal of Mental Health Nursing published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the impact of a virtual simulation game (VSG) to improve primary care sexual health services for breast cancer survivors. Methods: We developed a VSG to help primary care providers (PCPs) address sexual health disturbances among breast cancer survivors. We used a pretest–posttest design with a series of validated tools to assess the feasibility and perceived impact of the VGS, including an open-ended question about participants’ perceptions. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics and qualitative data through an inductive content analysis approach. Results: Of the 60 participants, the majority were nurse practitioner students (n = 26; 43.3%), female (n = 48; 80%), and worked full-time (n = 35; 58.3%). Participants perceived the VSG as feasible and potentially effective. The intervention elicited an improvement in PCPs’ perception of knowledge between pretest and posttest surveys (z = − 1.998, p = 0.046). Professional background and previous exposure to sexual health training were predictors of knowledge perception. Participants described the intervention as an engaging educational strategy where they felt safe to make mistakes and learn from that. Conclusions: VSGs can be a potentially effective educational approach for PCPs. Our findings indicate that despite being an engaging interactive strategy, VSG interventions should be tailored for each professional group. Implications for cancer survivors: This intervention has potential to improve the knowledge and practice of PCPs related to breast cancer follow-up care to support comprehensive care for survivors, resulting in a better quality of life and patient outcomes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Screen exposure during the critical period of brain development results in delayed language, learning and behaviour problems and subsequent sedentary lifestyle results in non-communicable disease later in life. Objectives: To assess the burden of digital screen exposure and parental perceptions of its effects in children. Method: This institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged 1-13 years in a tertiary healthcare centre in Puducherry, India, from April 2022 to June 2022. Data were collected using the Digital Screen Exposure Questionnaire (DSEQ), administered by trained Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship (CRRI) after pilot testing. Results: Our study shows that the prevalence of excessive screen exposure (>1 hour) was 25% during weekdays and 44.9% during weekends. The most common media used was television (TV) in 92.8%, closely followed by smart phones in 90%. Most frequently watched content (>5 times/ week) was random things for enjoyment in 57.8% followed by rhymes in 25.7%; 57.1% had no outside play during weekdays. Mother’s education was the main predictor which influenced the duration of screen exposure in study participants. Conclusions: Our study shows that the prevalence of excessive screen exposure (>1 hour) was 25% during weekdays and 44.9% during weekends. Common media used were TV in 92.8% and smart phones in 90%. Except for mother’s education, no other socio-demographic factor influenced the duration of screen exposure in study participants.

	abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the number of mobile apps designed for mental health proposes and mHealth has been perceived as a promising approach to help people with schizophrenia to manage their condition. However, adoption rates are relatively low and long-term user engagement is a major issue. The aim of this study is to identify and better understand what strategies and factors may influence user engagement and facilitate prolonged use of apps for people with schizophrenia to better manage their illness. A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Arksey and O’Malley scoping review framework and following PRISMA ScR guidelines. The sources consisted of searching four electronic databases. Rayyan software was used for this study selection process and a narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data. A total of 28 studies which met the inclusion criteria were identified. The engagement strategies included push notifications, message prompts, personalization, application customization, goal setting, game-like features, use of different multimedia formats, social connectedness, support (peers and professionals), reliability of content and quality of feedback received. Some demographic factors may influence adherence such as age, gender, education level and socioeconomic status. Other factors also may play a role impacting engagement: health status, data privacy and security, involvement in design process, incentives for participation, app usage fitting in the user routines, initial training, and constant technical support. Included studies present high heterogeneity in outcome measures and thresholds criteria to assess engagement. Understanding what influences engagement and how to measure it is essential to enhance the design of mobile apps and deliver scalable solutions to help people with schizophrenia better manage their illness in their real-world uptake. 2023 Simões de Almeida and Marques.},

Despite efforts to address the opioid epidemic in the United States, opioid-related morbidity and mortality have continued to rise. Few interventions have been tailored to prevent adolescent opioid misuse. MedSMA℞T: Adventures in PharmaCity (MedSMA℞T), is a serious game that educates the end-user by challenging them to make applicable decisions in a low-stakes environment. Objective: The study aimed to characterize pharmacists’ perspectives on using MedSMA℞T to educate adolescents and families about opioid medication safety. Methods: Pharmacists were recruited from the Pharmacy Practice Enhancement and Action Research Link (PearlRx) and the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin. Consented pharmacists played the MedSMA℞T game for 30 minutes while a research team member observed via Zoom. Virtual semi-structured interviews (45 minutes) were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Two members of the research team independently coded each transcript using NVivo software to conduct inductive thematic analyses. Bi-weekly meetings were held to discuss and refine codes as well as the master codebook, and identify prevalent themes (intercoder reliability, kappa = 0.91). Results: Twenty-two pharmacists were interviewed between August and November 2021. Four themes were identified: game content and design, patient education, implementation barriers, and implementation facilitators. Most pharmacists perceived MedSMA℞T to be an effective resource for opioid safety education. Pharmacists reported that age-appropriate language was used in combination with realistic scenarios and relatable characters. Pharmacists also highlighted the value of interactive gameplay to engage the player to actively learn and recall educational content. Conclusions: Pharmacists play an integral role as medication experts and contributed valuable insights into using and incorporating the MedSMA℞T game into various pharmacy practice settings. Future work is necessary to understand parents’ and adolescents’ perceptions of using MedSMA℞T as an opioid safety education tool in pharmacies. © 2023 American Pharmacists Association®},

	abstract = {Nowadays people use screens, such as mobile phones, television, or tablets, more often during mealtimes, which may have an effect on intake. This review aims to analyze the effect of screen use, during food consumption, on intake. A systematic review was carried out, based on those protocols established by PRISMA. The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases were consulted. Experimental studies, published between 2010 and 2021, that recorded individual intake while using screens such as television, cell phones, or tablets, were selected. A total of 7181 relevant articles were obtained, which were then assessed in accordance with predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 35 studies were included in the complete review: 22 compared different kinds of television content (e.g., adverts), five which compared television versus the absence of screens, four which compared television versus video games, two which compared the use of simultaneous screens, and two studies which included cell phones. A total of 27 studies reported consumption increases related to the presence of advertisements and food signals on screens. No significant differences in intake were reported in the eight studies that reported design or sample size limitations, or lack of control of certain variables. It is thus concluded that screen use during food consumption may increase intake. Education is necessary to regulate the habit of consuming food in the presence of screens. Also, the creation of policies that regulate advertising and food cues on screens are justified and must be accompanied by strategies to monitor compliance. As a limitation, further evidence is necessary in order to determine the effect of mobile phone and tablet use while eating.

The attainment and maintenance of positive SET is essential for most teaching staff to obtain and maintain tenure. It is not uncommon for teachers to receive offensive and non-constructive commentary unrelated to teaching quality. Regular exposure to SET contributes to stress and adversely impacts mental health and well-being. We surveyed Australian teaching academics in 2021, and in this paper, we explore the perceived impacts of SET on the teaching and learning experience, academic standards and quality. Many respondents perceived that SET contributes to an erosion of standards and inflation of grades. A thematic analysis of open-ended questions revealed potential mechanisms for these impacts. These include enabling a culture of incivility, elevating stress and anxiety in teaching staff, and pressure to change approaches to teaching and assessment to achieve the highest scores. Playing the SET game involves balancing a commitment to quality and standards with concessions to ensure optimal student satisfaction. Anonymous SET is overvalued, erodes standards and contributes to incivility. The process of SET needs urgent reform. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Young people living with HIV (YPLH) are at risk for poor treatment adherence. Short message service (SMS) interventions can improve adherence, yet few exist for YPLH. Our study investigated preferences for a game-based SMS intervention among YPLH in Ghana. Thirty-two YPLH, ages 18 to 24, were recruited from an HIV clinic to complete in-depth interviews. Content analysis of interview data revealed areas of technology use relevant to intervention implementation, including mobile communication preferences, internet access, and mobile game use. Participants reported high perceived utility towards intervention features: treatment reminders, gamification components, and involvement of supportive individuals (e.g., providers). Issues with privacy, literacy, and cultural/developmental appropriateness were among concerns raised. Suggestions were made for strengthening basic SMS features (e.g., using code words to protect privacy) and incorporating advanced features (e.g., simplifying game interactions). This novel approach may help engage YPLH in HIV care if carefully developed with attention towards its mechanisms and user preferences. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Studies show a relationship between social appearance anxiety, aggression, and behavioral addictions. However, the relationship between social appearance anxiety, aggression, smartphone addiction, and Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) has not been investigated. The present study used a self-report survey to examine the structural relationships between social appearance anxiety, aggression, smartphone addiction, and IGD. The sample comprised 383 Turkish undergraduate students (50.9% male; 49.1% female), all of who played online videogames. The study comprised demographic information questions and the Social Appearance Anxiety Scale, Buss-Perry Aggression Scale, Smartphone Addiction Scale, and the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form. The relationships between scales were examined utilizing structural equation modeling. The findings showed that social appearance anxiety (β=.583) and smartphone addiction (β=.319) had a direct effect on IGD. Additionally, smartphone addiction partially mediated the association between aggression and IGD (β=.125). These findings suggest longitudinal research is needed to examine the temporal patterns and directionality between social appearance anxiety, aggression, smartphone addiction, and IGD. The present study results demonstrate that IGD may be associated with social appearance anxiety, smartphone addiction, and aggression. Therefore, to help reduce the incidence of IGD, interventions are needed among gamers to inhibit social appearance anxiety, reduce smartphone addiction, and decrease aggression. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {By immersing learners in a playful, interactive, and engaging experience, Educational Escape Rooms (EERs) have been found to enhance learners’ motivation, help them to develop 21st century skills, and improve knowledge acquisition. As research into EERs is still in a preliminary phase, no unified framework about how to design them has been established yet. Additionally, existing frameworks rarely validate the quality and efficacy of the frameworks themselves in terms of usability and usefulness. Therefore, the present paper proposes Room2Educ8, a learner-centred framework for EER design that follows Design Thinking principles. It provides detailed heuristics for empathising with learners, defining learning objectives and constraints, adding narrative, designing puzzles, briefing and debriefing participants, prototyping and playtesting, documenting the whole process, and evaluating the EER experience. A mixed-methods internal validation study based on Instructional Design model validation was conducted with 104 postgraduate students between 2018–2022 to assess the framework’s integrity and use. The study findings suggest that Room2Educ8 can be proposed as a valid tool for developing a wide range of EER types that cover a variety of topics. Its well-described and practical steps make it appropriate for educators regardless of a lack of prior experience in EER design. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: The stigma faced by people living with HIV causes difficulties in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Decreasing this stigma is thus no less urgent than implementing behavioral interventions. Serious games are being increasingly adopted as an intervention mechanism to control HIV/AIDS around the world. However, the development and evaluation of these games in China are far from adequate. Objective: This research aimed to help decrease HIV-related stigma in China via the development and evaluation of a serious game, as well as promote a participatory gamification culture for health interventions. Methods: Initially, a serious game was developed using free resources from a user-generated content website. Then, quantitative and qualitative methods were employed for game evaluation. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to explore the game’s effect on HIV-related stigma. The trial included 167 university students, who were randomly allocated to game and control groups. After the experimental evaluation, focus group discussions were held with 64 participants, who were invited to form 16 groups. Results: The game was called The Second Kind of Life with HIV (SKLWH), which is a free online game that can be played on computers and smartphones. This game hopes to publicize that people living with HIV can live a normal life, that is, a second life different from that imagined by the public. Based on the gamification practice of SKLWH, the participatory serious game development model (PSGDM) was proposed, which guided the development of 3 other HIV-themed games. The trial showed that intimacy stigma was much more severe than morality stigma and personal interaction stigma. Females were more tolerant of morality stigma than males (mean score: 1.29 vs 1.50; P=.01). The game intervention showed an advantage in decreasing intimacy stigma (mean score [game vs control]: 2.43 vs 2.73; P=.04). The group discussions validated the quantitative results and provided further in-depth information. The game intervention was largely preferred by participants, and the belief in intimacy impossibility was commonly expressed by participants when considering their relationship with people living with HIV. Conclusions: HIV/AIDS education should adopt appropriate media interventions to mitigate different dimensions of HIV-related stigma. Serious games should be used to decrease intimacy stigma, which is the hardest form to diminish. It is expected that the PSGDM can promote the development of more health games. Furthermore, HIV/AIDS intervention requires interdisciplinary efforts and cooperation that will allow more people to participate and share the responsibility of promoting health. ©Xiaoxiao Zhang, Erman Lai.},

	abstract = {Background: Evidence-based innovations can improve health outcomes, but only if successfully implemented. Implementation can be complex, highly susceptible to failure, costly and resource intensive. Internationally, there is an urgent need to improve the implementation of effective innovations. Successful implementation is best guided by implementation science, but organizations lack implementation know-how and have difficulty applying it. Implementation support is typically shared in static, non-interactive, overly academic guides and is rarely evaluated. In-person implementation facilitation is often soft-funded, costly, and scarce. This study seeks to improve effective implementation by (1) developing a first-in-kind digital tool to guide pragmatic, empirically based and self-directed implementation planning in real-time; and (2) exploring the tool’s feasibility in six health organizations implementing different innovations. Methods: Ideation emerged from a paper-based resource, The Implementation Game©, and a revision called The Implementation Roadmap©; both integrate core implementation components from evidence, models and frameworks to guide structured, explicit, and pragmatic planning. Prior funding also generated user personas and high-level product requirements. This study will design, develop, and evaluate the feasibility of a digital tool called The Implementation Playbook©. In Phase 1, user-centred design and usability testing will inform tool content, visual interface, and functions to produce a minimum viable product. Phase 2 will explore the Playbook’s feasibility in six purposefully selected health organizations sampled for maximum variation. Organizations will use the Playbook for up to 24 months to implement an innovation of their choosing. Mixed methods will gather: (i) field notes from implementation team check-in meetings; (ii) interviews with implementation teams about their experience using the tool; (iii) user free-form content entered into the tool as teams work through implementation planning; (iv) Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change questionnaire; (v) System Usability Scale; and (vi) tool metrics on how users progressed through activities and the time required to do so. Discussion: Effective implementation of evidence-based innovations is essential for optimal health. We seek to develop a prototype digital tool and demonstrate its feasibility and usefulness across organizations implementing different innovations. This technology could fill a significant need globally, be highly scalable, and potentially valid for diverse organizations implementing various innovations. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objectives: To determine associations between bedtime screen time behaviors and sleep outcomes in a national study of early adolescents. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 10,280 early adolescents aged 10-14 (48.8% female) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (Year 2, 2018-2020). Regression analyses examined the association between self-reported bedtime screen use and self- and caregiver-reported sleep measures, including sleep disturbance symptoms, controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, household income, parent education, depression, data collection period (pre- vs. during COVID-19 pandemic), and study site. Results: Overall, 16% of adolescents had at least some trouble falling or staying asleep in the past 2 weeks and 28% had overall sleep disturbance, based on caregiver reports. Adolescents who had a television or an Internet-connected electronic device in the bedroom had a greater risk of having trouble falling or staying asleep (adjusted risk ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.12-1.44) and overall sleep disturbance (adjusted risk ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.25). Adolescents who left their phone ringer activated overnight had more trouble falling/staying asleep and greater overall sleep disturbance compared to those who turned off their cell phones at bedtime. Streaming movies, playing video games, listening to music, talking/texting on the phone, and using social media or chat rooms were all associated with trouble falling/staying asleep and sleep disturbance. Conclusions: Several bedtime screen use behaviors are associated with sleep disturbances in early adolescents. The study's findings can inform guidance for specific bedtime screen behaviors among early adolescents. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Traditional longitudinal aging research involves studying the same individuals over a long period, with measurement intervals typically several years apart. App-based studies have the potential to provide new insights into life-course aging by improving the accessibility, temporal specificity, and real-world integration of data collection. We developed a new research app for iOS named Labs Without Walls to facilitate the study of life-course aging. Combined with data collected using paired smartwatches, the app collects complex data including data from one-time surveys, daily diary surveys, repeated game-like cognitive and sensory tasks, and passive health and environmental data. Objective: The aim of this protocol is to describe the research design and methods of the Labs Without Walls study conducted between 2021 and 2023 in Australia. Methods: Overall, 240 Australian adults will be recruited, stratified by age group (18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56-65, 66-75, and 76-85 years) and sex at birth (male and female). Recruitment procedures include emails to university and community networks, as well as paid and unpaid social media advertisements. Participants will be invited to complete the study onboarding either in person or remotely. Participants who select face-to-face onboarding (n=approximately 40) will be invited to complete traditional in-person cognitive and sensory assessments to be cross-validated against their app-based counterparts. Participants will be sent an Apple Watch and headphones for use during the study period. Participants will provide informed consent within the app and then begin an 8-week study protocol, which includes scheduled surveys, cognitive and sensory tasks, and passive data collection using the app and a paired watch. At the conclusion of the study period, participants will be invited to rate the acceptability and usability of the study app and watch. We hypothesize that participants will be able to successfully provide e-consent, input survey data through the Labs Without Walls app, and have passive data collected over 8 weeks; participants will rate the app and watch as user-friendly and acceptable; the app will allow for the study of daily variability in self-perceptions of age and gender; and data will allow for the cross-validation of app- and laboratory-based cognitive and sensory tasks. Results: Recruitment began in May 2021, and data collection was completed in February 2023. The publication of preliminary results is anticipated in 2023. Conclusions: This study will provide evidence regarding the acceptability and usability of the research app and paired watch for studying life-course aging processes on multiple timescales. The feedback obtained will be used to improve future iterations of the app, explore preliminary evidence for intraindividual variability in self-perceptions of aging and gender expression across the life span, and explore the associations between performance on app-based cognitive and sensory tests and that on similar traditional cognitive and sensory tests. © 2023 JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS.

This study used a mixed methods approach to develop and conduct a formative evaluation of a digital application for sexual assault prevention. Make a change is a digital application that uses the principles of games for health to foster learning, engagement, and skill-building around risk and protective factors for sexual victimization, sexual aggression, and bystander intervention. The digital application includes four narrative chapters, six embedded activities, as well as a user-derived change plan in which individuals establish goals for behavior change following program completion. This multisite study at a 2- and a 4-year college utilized student interviews (n = 14), stakeholder interviews (n = 10), and focus groups with students (n = 40) to inform intervention development. A total of 41 college students then participated in an open trial and completed self-report surveys (pre, post, and 1-month follow-up) to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, utility, and preliminary outcomes. Most of the sample reported enjoyment, usefulness, and perceived competence after completing the application. Data evidenced a trend to reduce the frequency of heavy drinking, and perceptions of social norms evidenced change over time.

	abstract = {Cyberbullying is widely acknowledged as a serious public health problem affecting adolescents and youth. Numerous digital and non-digital interventions have been developed to minimize cyberbullying occurrences considering the negative social and psychological effects of cyberbullying on youths’ development. Therefore, to gain deeper insight into the existing intervention programs, this review aims to examine the intervention programs for youth published up to 2022. The literature search was conducted on several academic databases, including ProQuest, Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar. Youth who experienced cyberbullying reported negative emotions, including depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts. Regardless of their duration and intervention strategies, most studies, such as Conectado, Cyberprogram 2.0, and KiVa study show an increase in awareness of CB risk and decreased cyber aggression and victimization in the intervention, which consisted of digital, non-digital, focused, or universal approaches. Studies have shown that while some programs were designed to create awareness and prevent cyberbullying, others were designed to interfere with cyberbullying, and others were designed to accomplish both. Cyberbullying programs were more successful when administered by technology-savvy content experts compared to educators, regardless of the intervention type, program duration, or presence of parental engagement. Studies revealed that the crucial component of effective interventions includes awareness training, coping skills, and interactive serious games. The results of this review are crucial to influencing future investigations into intervention by tailoring digital programs for a wider audience, particularly those in underdeveloped nations. Recommendations for future research are provided. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Informal learning may promote the self-determination transition-age autistic youth need to overcome and/or transform these barriers. This report focuses on the iterative process of developing video game design workshops guided by feedback from autistic students about instructional strategies they found engaging. This study is part of a three-year-long NSF-funded program of research that seeks to empower autistic youth to move toward successful careers by teaching educators how to more effectively guide them. Methods: In the Summer of 2021, educators at an award-winning NYC-based, not-for-profit, education program, Tech Kids Unlimited (TKU) collaborated with researchers, including autistic students, to iteratively develop and assess two online game design workshops for transition-age autistic youth. Participants selected which workshop they were available for (Workshop 1: n = 18; M age = 16.72 years; Workshop 2: n = 16; M age = 16.56 years). Students in Workshop 2 had more varied support needs and were less motivated to learn video game design than students in Workshop 1. Students completed assessments before and after each workshop and rated their interest in specific workshop activities after each activity. Guided by data from Workshop 1, we revised instructional strategies before conducting Workshop 2. Results: We found little evidence for our hypothesis that attentional style would impact educational engagement. However, video game design self-efficacy and self-determination were often positively associated with engagement. Two industry speakers, one of whom was autistic, were among the highest-rated activities. As hypothesized, video game design self-efficacy and self-determination (and unexpectedly) spatial planning improved from pre- to post-test following Workshop 1. Despite our efforts to use what we learned in Workshop 1 to improve in Workshop 2, Workshop 2 did not lead to significant improvements in outcomes. However, students highlighted instructional strategies as a strength of Workshop 2 more often than they had for Workshop 1. Educators highlighted the importance of group “temperature checks,” individualized check-ins, social–emotional support for students and educators, and fostering a positive atmosphere. Discussion: Findings suggest that interactive multimodal activities, stimulating discussions, and opportunities to engage with neurodivergent industry professionals may engage and empower diverse autistic youth.

	abstract = {Pokémon Go (2016) not only enjoys tremendous worldwide appeal among players, the game has also captivated the scientific community. The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics and motivations of hardcore Pokémon Go players by analyzing self-reported data from 1630 trainers of level 25 and higher. There were more female players in our sample, yet males played more and showed more progress in the game. In general, the need for in-game relatedness was the strongest predictor of playing, followed by the need for in-game competence. Male players showed stronger in-game motivational needs for relatedness and competence, whereas female players were more strongly motivated by a need for autonomy. The needs for relatedness and competence predicted spending on microtransactions, whereas the need for autonomy did not. Depending on the measure for gaming disorder, between 1% and 9% of these core players met the diagnostic criteria. Gaming disorder was also related to social anxiety and increased spending on in-game microtransactions. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Background: There is growing interest in using information and communication technologies (ICTs) to improve access to mental health services for youth experiencing homelessness (YEH); however, limited efforts have been made to synthesize this literature. Objective: This study aimed to review the research on the use of ICTs to provide mental health services and interventions for YEH. Methods: We used a scoping review methodology following the Arksey and O’Malley framework and guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis. The results are reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). A systematic search was conducted from 2005 to 2021 in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Maestro and in ProQuest Thesis and Dissertations, Papyrus, Homeless Hub, and Google Scholar for gray literature. Studies were included if participants’ mean age was between 13 and 29 years, youth with mental health issues were experiencing homelessness or living in a shelter, ICTs were used as a means of intervention, and the study provided a description of the technology. The exclusion criteria were technology that did not allow for interaction (eg, television) and languages other than French or English. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative approaches. Two reviewers were involved in the screening and data extraction process in consultation with a third reviewer. The data were summarized in tables and by narrative synthesis. Results: From the 2153 abstracts and titles screened, 12 were included in the analysis. The most common types of ICTs used were communication technologies (eg, phone, video, and SMS text messages) and mobile apps. The intervention goals varied widely across studies; the most common goal was reducing risky behaviors, followed by addressing cognitive functioning, providing emotional support, providing vital resources, and reducing anxiety. Most studies (9/11, 82%) focused on the feasibility of interventions. Almost all studies reported high levels of acceptability (8/9, 89%) and moderate to high frequency of use (5/6, 83%). The principal challenges were related to technical problems such as the need to replace phones, issues with data services, and phone charging. Conclusions: Our results indicate the emerging role of ICTs in the delivery of mental health services to YEH and that there is a high level of acceptability based on early feasibility studies. However, our results should be interpreted cautiously, considering the limited number of studies included in the analysis and the elevated levels of dropout. There is a need to advance efficacy and effectiveness research in this area with larger and longer studies. ©Shalini Lal, Sarah Elias, Vida Sieu, Rossana Peredo.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Studies on self-determination theory (SDT) have placed satisfaction of basic psychological needs (autonomy, relatedness, and competence) at the core of well-being, whereas frustration of these needs results in multiple potentially unhealthy mental and behavioral patterns. This study analyzed how need satisfaction and frustration relate to the severity of gambling and gaming problems. Methods: A survey study with 18–75-year-old Finnish participants (N = 1530; 50.33% male) was conducted in April 2021. Basic psychological needs were measured with the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale, mental health issues with the five-item Mental Health Inventory, gambling problems with the Problem Gambling Severity Index, and gaming problems with the Internet Gaming Disorder Test. Zero-inflated negative binomial analyses were conducted to examine how satisfaction and frustration of basic psychological needs, together with mental health issues, are associated with gaming and gambling problems. Results: Mental health issues were associated with gambling and gaming problems, but this association became nonsignificant when basic psychological needs were added to the model. However, better mental health still was associated with the absence of gaming problems. While need satisfaction had no association with the absence of gaming or gambling problems, need frustration was associated with increases in the severity of both gaming and gambling problems. Discussion: Frustration of basic psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence is associated with both gambling and gaming problems and should be considered when developing treatment and support for those who experience such problems. © 2022},

Leisure-time pursuits have been linked to higher quality of life in the general population and among autistic adults. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore leisure-time use among transition-age autistic youth. Method: Youth ages 18–23 years were recruited through universities and organizations that serve the autistic population and their families across the United States. Participants took photos of their leisure-time activities over a 7-day period using their own smartphones. They were then interviewed via Zoom using a semi-structured interview guide that was based on the Self-Determination Theory framework and the Iwasaki leisure-time model. Data were analyzed using directed qualitative content analysis based on the theoretical framework. Results: Eighteen young autistic adults participated in the study (nine male, five female, three agender/non-binary, and one transgender). Solitary, screen-based activities were most common. Major themes were that activities contributed positively to a sense of achievement and a sense of autonomy, and there were few major barriers to favored activities. While most activities were done alone, rather than describing these activities as isolating, activities helped participants cope with stress. Participants gained a sense of connection when they were engaged in leisure activities with others who shared common interests. Conclusions: Results suggest that appropriate interventions may support youth in choosing activities they most enjoy, even if they appear to be solitary or sedentary, and to help ensure that youth are gaining maximal benefits from these activities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The effects of playing fear-inducing games in virtual reality (VR) is rather unexplored, since research mainly focuses on positive emotions. To investigate the relationship between immersion, presence and negative emotion induction, we compared repeated horror game usage between playing on desktop computers, in VR, and smart substitutional reality (SSR), which supplements VR with additional haptic and thermal stimuli. Conducting a longitudinal study utilizing questionnaires, observations and physiological measurements, we expected an increase of fear using VR and SSR due to the increased immersion. Physiological data was not analyzed due to huge data loss, while observations and self-reports revealed contradictory results. Behavioral data showed stronger expression of fear in VR and SSR. Presence was increased in the VR and SSR groups compared to PC, further a mediation of emotion induction via presence was confirmed. Altogether, the reception of horror games within VR or SSR is associated with strong emotional reactions for selected individuals. Future research should take methodological lessons learned into account. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Adolescents contribute slightly less than one-third of all new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa. There is a need for more effective intervention approaches to help young adolescents safely navigate through adolescence and into adulthood. We are assessing the efficacy of Tumaini, a smartphone game designed to prevent HIV among young Africans. Against the background of COVID-19, meaningful alteration of the research protocol was necessary to ensure successful implementation and retention of the study participants in ongoing research. Objective: The objective of our protocol is to determine (1) if Tumaini delays sexual debut and increases condom use at first sex and (2) whether it influences behavioral mediators of early and unprotected sex. Methods: Participants were recruited from Kisumu County in Western Kenya. This study is a 2-arm, individual-randomized controlled trial that enrolled 1004 adolescents aged between 12 years and 15 years. The intervention arm participants are playing Tumaini, while the control arm is provided with Brainilis, a commercially available control game. The study period will last 45 months. At baseline, participants in both arms completed a baseline survey and biological testing for HIV and herpes simplex virus, type 2 (HSV-2); participants will have annual game play periods in years 1-3. They will also complete a total of 12 follow-up surveys. At endline, repeat biological testing will be conducted. Protocol adaptations were necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and implemented in accordance with local public health guidelines. Results: Participants were enrolled between October 2020 and November 2020. We plan to complete study procedures in September 2024. The enrolled participant sample was 50.1% (499/996) female and had a mean age of 14.0 (SD 0.6) years. Conclusions: This ongoing research demonstrates that, with appropriate revisions to planned protocol activities guided by the need to maintain study integrity, protect both study participants and staff, and adhere to institutional review board and local health authority guidelines, human subject research is possible in the context of a global pandemic. If the trial demonstrates efficacy, Tumaini would provide an alternative, remote means of delivering age-appropriate education to adolescents on safer sex, HIV prevention, and effective life skills on a highly scalable, low-cost, and culturally adaptable platform.  © 2022 Victor Mudhune, Gaëlle Sabben, Ken Ondenge, Calvin Mbeda, Marissa Morales, Robert H Lyles, Judith Arego, Richard Ndivo, Robert A Bednarczyk, Kelli Komro, Kate Winskell.},

It has enabled the development and implementation of mobile serious games to promote healthy behavior change in rural communities. This paper examines the use of mobile serious games in healthcare education, with a particular focus on those designed to increase health literacy in rural Africa. Identifying and addressing the design challenges and issues faced by people living in rural African communities through the use of persuasive mobile games can promote behavior change among these underserved communities. We used PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and manual search to identify relevant studies published from 2011 to July 2021. The literature review highlights how the identified challenges affect the implementation of persuasive strategies, suggests design solutions for overcoming them, and discusses how persuasive games can be tailored to suit the target rural African populations. Some of the identified challenges are technical in nature (e.g., access to electricity and internet connectivity), while others are not (e.g., language diversity and low literacy). As the number of serious games for healthcare education and awareness continues to increase, it is essential for the successful implementation of inclusive mobile health technologies in rural Africa to identify and address the specific challenges faced by underserved populations such as rural African communities.

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a deficit-driven neurodevelopmental condition in three areas, which are social interactions, communication, and the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. Children with autism mainly suffer from emotional disturbance that emerges as meltdowns, tantrums, and aggression, increasing the risk of developing mental health issues. Several studies have assessed the use of serious games in helping children with autism enhance their communication, learning, and social skills. Significantly, these serious games focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the disorder to establish a comfortable and controlled environment that is able to support children with autism. However, there is still a lack of evidence in studies exploring the use of serious games for children with autism to facilitate the development of emotion regulation. The aim of this study is to consolidate and propose a new serious game design principle for children with autism to facilitate the development of emotion regulation. The target age of the children involved in this study ranged between 6 and 12. A review of previous literature on serious game design principles was conducted. More than 70 articles related to serious games for children with autism were analysed using thematic analysis. This study found 16 elements that influenced the designing and developing process of creating a serious game for children with autism. It has been organised and categorised into five attributes (user, game objectives, game elements, game aesthetics, and player experience). Certainly, this study demonstrates the needs and requirements of children with autism when designing serious games. © 2023, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

	abstract = {Background: Slow-paced breathing training can have positive effects on physiological and psychological well-being. Unfortunately, use statistics indicate that adherence to breathing training apps is low. Recent work suggests that gameful breathing training may help overcome this challenge. Objective: This study aimed to introduce and evaluate the gameful breathing training app Breeze 2 and its novel real-time breathing detection algorithm that enables the interactive components of the app. Methods: We developed the breathing detection algorithm by using deep transfer learning to detect inhalation, exhalation, and nonbreathing sounds (including silence). An additional heuristic prolongs detected exhalations to stabilize the algorithm’s predictions. We evaluated Breeze 2 with 30 participants (women: n=14, 47%; age: mean 29.77, SD 7.33 years). Participants performed breathing training with Breeze 2 in 2 sessions with and without headphones. They answered questions regarding user engagement (User Engagement Scale Short Form [UES-SF]), perceived effectiveness (PE), perceived relaxation effectiveness, and perceived breathing detection accuracy. We used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare the UES-SF, PE, and perceived relaxation effectiveness scores with neutral scores. Furthermore, we correlated perceived breathing detection accuracy with actual multi-class balanced accuracy to determine whether participants could perceive the actual breathing detection performance. We also conducted a repeated-measure ANOVA to investigate breathing detection differences in balanced accuracy with and without the heuristic and when classifying data captured from headphones and smartphone microphones. The analysis controlled for potential between-subject effects of the participants’ sex. Results: Our results show scores that were significantly higher than neutral scores for the UES-SF (W=459; P<.001), PE (W=465; P<.001), and perceived relaxation effectiveness (W=358; P<.001). Perceived breathing detection accuracy correlated significantly with the actual multi-class balanced accuracy (r=0.51; P<.001). Furthermore, we found that the heuristic significantly improved the breathing detection balanced accuracy (F1,25=6.23; P=.02) and that detection performed better on data captured from smartphone microphones than than on data from headphones (F1,25=17.61; P<.001). We did not observe any significant between-subject effects of sex. Breathing detection without the heuristic reached a multi-class balanced accuracy of 74% on the collected audio recordings. Conclusions: Most participants (28/30, 93%) perceived Breeze 2 as engaging and effective. Furthermore, breathing detection worked well for most participants, as indicated by the perceived detection accuracy and actual detection accuracy. In future work, we aim to use the collected breathing sounds to improve breathing detection with regard to its stability and performance. We also plan to use Breeze 2 as an intervention tool in various studies targeting the prevention and management of noncommunicable diseases. © Yanick Xavier Lukic, Gisbert Wilhelm Teepe, Elgar Fleisch, Tobias Kowatsch.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of video games, a hobby for many teenagers in their leisure time, has brought with it a new potential for concerns. Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is a mental condition classified as a disorder due to addictive behaviors. It may include use of video games, both online and offline. Consequences of IGD may include introversion, social anxiety, mood swings, loneliness, sleep problems, behavioral problems, depression, low self-esteem, and increased violence. In order to design an app-based intervention for adolescents, a transtheoretical model (TTM) has been used. This widely used model in the field of behavioral change is also practical for health education programs. In addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used to make people more aware of their behaviors, feelings and thoughts and how to achieve behavioral change. The present study seeks to determine the effectiveness of this app-based intervention in in the treatment of IGD among adolescents. Method: In this single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 206 high-school adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in Qazvin city will be recruited. Eligible adolescents will be randomly assigned into intervention and control groups. Eight consecutive sessions delivered over 2 months and based on the TTM and CBT will be delivered through the `app (named HAPPYTEEN) to the intervention group. The control group will receive a sleep hygiene intervention (8 consecutive sessions for 2 months) via the app. Data collection tools include the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales, Stages of Change Questionnaire, Decision Balance, and Self-Efficacy. The study measures will be completed at baseline, post intervention, and 1 month and 3 months after the intervention. Discussion: The results of this intervention could be used as adjunct therapy for adolescents with IGD. Trial registration: Clinical Trial Registration Center of Iran (IRCT) IRCT20181226042140N1.

	abstract = {Aim The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments around the globe to implement various restriction policies, including lockdown, social distancing, and school closures. Subsequently, there has been a surge in sedentary behaviour particularly screen time (ST) together with a significant decline in physical activity that was more marked amongst children and adolescents. Excessive screen exposure in adolescents has been correlated with cardio-metabolic risk factors including obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol, and glucose intolerance that may have adverse morbidity and mortality implications in adulthood. Thus, the current study aimed to synthesize the literature on the relationship between ST of various types and the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adolescents in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In August 2021, a systematic search of the literature was undertaken using electronic databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochran library. Studies were considered if they met the following key eligibility criteria: (i) Measure of ST as an exposure (TV, computer, videogames, internet, smartphone, tablet), using quantified duration/frequency either selfreported or observed; (ii) Measure of MetS as an outcome with standard definition and/or criteria required to establish MetS diagnosis. The Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies was used to assess the risk of bias. Results A total of ten studies met the inclusion criteria, and the majority were cross sectional studies. Most studies met fair bias scoring. Overall, the review revealed considerable evidence that suggests a significant negative association between ST and components of MetS among adolescents with dose-response association. Conclusion During the pandemic, screen usage may become more prevalent through periods of school closures, lockdowns, social isolation, and online learning classes. Public health policies and health promotion strategies targeting parents are needed to raise awareness of the adverse health effects associated with screen-based sedentary behaviour as a precursor of NCDs. Parent or home focused interventions might be effective in limiting adolescents' screen exposure, alternatively substituted with an appropriate level of physical activity.  © 2022 Musa et al.

This study aims to develop such a system and provide a reference for enhancing the quality of interactive fitness games. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this, interviews and questionnaires were conducted to identify the factors that influence the quality of interactive fitness games. The Kano model and SII (Satisfaction Increment Index)-Dissatisfaction Decrement Index (DDI) two-dimensional quadrant analysis were then used to explore differences in quality judgment between males and females, as well as their priorities for improving interactive fitness games. Findings: The study revealed that males and females have different quality judgments for “rich and diverse content,” “motivational value,” “sensitive motion recognition detection” and “portability.” However, both genders share similar views on the other quality factors. In addition, the study identified differences in the priority of improvement between men and women. “Very interesting,” “effective fitness achievement,” “motivating fitness maintenance,” “sensitive motion recognition detection,” “portability” and “educational value” were found to be of higher priority for men than women. Originality/value: These findings provide a valuable theoretical reference for developers and designers of interactive fitness games seeking to enhance the user experience. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Background: India has one of the largest adolescent populations in the world. Yet adolescents, particularly adolescent girls, have limited access to correct sexual and reproductive health information and services. The context in which adolescent girls live is one of gender inequity where they contend with early marriage and early pregnancy and have few opportunities for quality education and labor force participation. The digital revolution has expanded the penetration of mobile phones across India, increasingly being used by adolescent girls. Health interventions are also moving onto digital platforms. Evidence has shown that applications of game elements and game-based learning can be powerful tools in behavior change and health interventions. This provides a unique opportunity, particularly for the private sector, to reach and empower adolescent girls directly with information, products, and services in a private and fun manner. Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe how a design-led Theory of Change (ToC) was formulated for a mobile game app that is not only underpinned by theories of various behavior change models but also identifies variables and triggers for in-game behavioral intentions that can be tracked and measured within the game and validated through a rigorous post-gameplay outcome evaluation. Methods: We describe the use of a multimix methodology to formulate a ToC informing behavioral frameworks and co-design approaches in our proof-of-concept product development journey. This process created a statement of hypothesis and “pathways to impact” with a continuous, cumulative, and iterative design process that included key stakeholders in the production of a smartphone app. With theoretical underpinnings of social behavior and modeling frameworks, systematic research, and other creative methods, we developed a design-led ToC pathway that can delineate complex and multidisciplinary outputs for measuring impact. Results: The statement of hypothesis that emerged posits that “If girls virtually experience the outcomes of choices that they make for their avatar in the mobile game, then they can make informed decisions that direct the course of their own life.” Four learning pathways (DISCOVER, PLAY, DECIDE, and ACT) are scaffolded on 3 pillars of evidence, engagement, and evaluation to support the ToC-led framework. It informs decision-making and life outcomes through game-based objectives and in-game triggers that offer direct access to information, products, and services. Conclusions: This approach of using a multimix methodology for identifying varied and multidisciplinary pathways to change is of particular interest to measuring the impact of innovations, especially digital products, that do not necessarily conform with traditional behavioral change models or standard co-design approaches. We also explain the benefits of using iterative and cumulative inputs to integrate ongoing user feedback, while identifying pathways to various impacts, and not limiting it to only the design and development phase. © Lalita Shankar, Anvita Dixit, Susan Howard.},

	abstract = {In a video game review, the main focus is the narratives, characters, graphics, and mechanics in the gameplay. Some recent research mentions the user interface only when it comes into light as a creative platform for simple interactive narratives from a technical point of view; this narrative is mainly a software tool that requires traditionally modernized inputs from the user. The user needs to interact with the navigational controls or menus in order to start a basic game play. A complex game interface as stimulus is generally considered as having a feeling of immersion that allows for visual tracking of user behavioural patterns and use it to predict the next strategy of the user using robust computational models. A number of users have limited sensory perception in a gameplay and hence rely on complex game stimulus and an adaptive model is paramount when considering behavioural expectations that place the user in a digital environment with more expressive perceptions. We developed a custom based eye tracking and 3D object detection algorithm which was utilised by recruiting users to interact with visual 3D objects and trace their eye movement behaviour to generated data. We then applied the use of recurrent neural network (RNN) for direct tracing of user behavioural activities in a sequential manner to predict their behaviour for interface adaptation. Result indicates that redundant user attributes are flexible and flawless for identifying predicted response of the user in a controlled environment. This would lead to prototypical representation of user behavioural analytics as an embedded platform in the confined digital environment. One of the limitations of the project is its inability to basically specify the 3D gaze point at the inner boundaries of the visual field. Data visualisation is strictly based on combined object flow detection. The originality of the work is its ability to redefine fixation point to a rendered cascaded 3D gaze point and space-defined saccade which is indicated by the distance between one gaze points to the other. The 3D gaze point would be well suited for fixation generalisation on 3D as well as on 2D digital oriented environment. © The author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Over 70% of men are overweight, and most desire weight loss; however, men are profoundly underrepresented in weight loss programs. Gamification represents a novel approach to engaging men and may enhance efficacy through two means: (1) game-based elements (e.g., streaks, badges, team-based competition) to motivate weight control behaviors and (2) arcade-style “neurotraining” to enhance neurocognitive capacities to resist the temptation of unhealthy foods and more automatically select healthy foods. This study will use a 2 × 2 factorial design to examine the independent and combinatory efficacy of gamification and inhibitory control training (ICT). Men with overweight/obesity (N = 228) will receive a 12-month mobile weight loss program that incorporates behavioral weight loss strategies (e.g., self-monitoring, goal setting, stimulus control). Men will be randomly assigned to a non-gamified or gamified version, and an active or sham ICT. A game design company will create the program, with input from a male advisory panel. Aims of the project are to test whether a gamified (versus non-gamified) weight loss program and/or ICT (versus sham) promotes greater improvements in weight, diet, and physical activity; whether these treatment factors have combinatory or synergistic effects; to test whether postulated mechanisms of action (increased engagement, for gamification, and inhibitory control, for ICT) mediate treatment effects; and whether baseline gameplay frequency and implicit preferences for ICT-targeted foods moderate effects. It is hoped this study will contribute to improved mHealth programs for men and enhance our understanding of the impact of gamified elements and neurocognitive training on weight control. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

This paper presents a comprehensive study to exploit these technologies' innovative approaches and capabilities. The study is specifically adopted to implement small and medium-size architectural and construction practices with a limited budget and time dedicated to visualisation creation. The collected evidence proved that a game-like platform combined with BIM could provide simplified data delivery to a client, leading to customer satisfaction, confidence and increased sales. The designed workflow and templates were tested in the case study of a small self-build construction company. The staff was trained to provide BIM data correctly and use supplied game templates. The case study demonstrated that automation of the VR House Configurator creation is achievable. The study's outcome is an integrated solution to regenerate BIM models in the game environment and utilise the house configurator's organised furniture library and costing interface. Furthermore, the usability tests confirmed the applicability, practicability, and validity of the developed framework and tools to deal with the revealed challenges in the self-build sector. Finally, the research provided a fresh approach for the companies in the sector, a step-by-step guide for implementing the innovative changes, and detailed descriptions of the methodologies and workflows. © 2022},

	abstract = {Background: The emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has introduced additional pressures on an already fragile mental health care system due to a significant rise in depression, anxiety, and stress among Canadians. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is known to be an efficacious treatment to reduce such mental health issues, few people have access to CBT in an engaging and sustainable manner. To address this gap, a collaboration between the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) developed CBT-based self-led, online, clinician-tested modules in the form of a video game, named Legend of Evelys, and evaluated its usability in the attenuation of a COVID-19–related increase in stress. Objective: We here present the conceptualization and design of new self-care modules in the form of a video game, its implementation in a technological infrastructure, and inclusivity and privacy considerations that informed the development. A usability study of the modules was performed to assess the video game’s usability, user engagement, and user perceptions. Methods: The development of the video game involved establishment of a technology infrastructure for secure implementation of the software for the modules and a clinician-led assessment of the clinical utility of these modules through two “whiteboard” sessions. The usability study was informed by a mixed methods sequential explanatory design to evaluate the intervention of the mobile app through two distinct phases: quantitative data collection using in-app analytics data and two surveys, followed by qualitative data collection by semistructured interviews. Results: A total of 32 participants trialed the app for 2 weeks. They used the video game an average of six times and rated the game as “good” based on the Systems Usability Scale score. In terms of stress reduction, the study demonstrated a significant difference in the participants’ Perceived Stress Scale score at baseline (mean 22.14, SD 6.187) compared with that at the 2-week follow-up (mean 18.04, SD 6.083; t27=3.628, P=.001). Qualitative interviews helped participants identify numerous functionality issues and provided specific recommendations, most of which were successfully integrated into the video game for future release. Conclusions: Through this collaboration, we have established that it is possible to incorporate CBT exercises into a video game and have these exercises adopted to address stress. While video games are a promising strategy to help people with their stress and anxiety, there is a further need to examine the real-world effectiveness of the Legend of Evelys in reducing anxiety. ©Nadia Minian, Anika Saiva, Allison Gayapersad, Rosa Dragonetti, Catherine Proulx, Patricia Debergue, Julia Lecce, Sarwar Hussain, Eric Desjardins, Peter Selby.},

	abstract = {Aggressive behavior is one of the pervasive and costly negative behaviors in everyday life. Previous studies have shown that individuals who are excluded tend to exhibit more aggressive behaviors, but it is unclear whether the type of self-construction of individuals in the same cultural background will affect the differences in aggressive behavior after being excluded. Therefore, the current study examined the differences in aggressive behavior of individuals with different self-construal types in the same cultural background after social exclusion through two experiments. A total of 128 effective participants were recruited for Experiment 1. Individuals’ self-construal types were classified by the Self-Construal Scale, the cyberball game was used for the manipulation of social exclusion, and the laboratory assistant application paradigm was used to measure individuals’ relational aggression. The results showed that compared with interdependent self-constructors, independent self-constructors exhibited more relational aggression in the exclusion group. A total of 141 effective participants were recruited for Experiment 2. Using the same method as Experiment 1 to classify participants’ self-construal types and induce excluded experiences, the hot sauce paradigm was used to measure individuals’ physical aggression. The results showed that compared with interdependent self-constructors, independent self-constructors exhibited more physical aggression in the exclusion group. The current study helps to understand whether social exclusion negatively impacts individuals with different self-constructors in the same cultural background and provides enlightenment on how individuals who are self-constructors cope with social exclusion. © 2023 by the authors.},

Traditional prevention programs including cardiac rehabilitation are under-accessed, which smartphone apps may overcome. To evaluate the effect of a game-based mobile app intervention (MyHeartMate) to improve cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle behaviours. Methods and results: Single-blind randomized trial of CHD patients in Sydney, 2017-2021. Intervention group were provided the MyHeartMate app for 6 months. Co-designed features included an avatar of the patient's heart and tokens earned by risk factor work (tracking, challenges, and quizzes). The control group received usual care. Primary outcome was self-reported physical activity [metabolic equivalents (METs), Global Physical Activity Questionnaire] and secondary outcomes included lipid levels, blood pressure (BP), body mass index, and smoking. Pre-specified sample size was achieved (n = 390), age 61.2 ± 11.5 years; 82.5% men and 9.2% current smokers. At 6 months, adjusted for baseline levels, the intervention group achieved more physical activity than control (median difference 329 MET mins/wk), which was not statistically significant (95% CI -37.4, 696; P = 0.064). No differences occurred between groups on secondary outcomes except for lower triglyceride levels in the intervention [mean difference -0.3 (95% CI -0.5, -0.1 mmoL/L, P = 0.004)]. Acceptability was high: 94.8% of intervention participants engaged by tracking exercise or BP and completing missions; 26.8% continued to engage for ≥30 days. Participants (n = 14) reported the app supported tracking behaviours and risk factors, reinforcing and improving self-care confidence, and decreasing anxiety. Conclusion: A game-based app proved highly acceptable for patients with CHD but did not improve risk factors or lifestyle behaviours other than triglyceride levels.  © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Digital technologies are being increasingly utilized in healthcare to provide pertinent and timely information for primary prevention, such as vaccination. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review to describe and assess current digital health interventions to promote HPV vaccination among adolescents and parents of adolescents, and to recommend directions for future interventions of this kind. Using appropriate medical subject headings and keywords, we searched multiple databases to identify relevant studies published in English between 1 January 2017 and 31 July 2022. We screened and selected eligible studies for inclusion in the final analysis. We reviewed a total of 24 studies, which included interventions using text messages (4), mobile apps (4), social media and websites (8), digital games (4), and videos (4). The interventions generally improved determinants of HPV vaccination, such as HPV-related knowledge, vaccine-related conversations, and vaccination intentions. In particular, text message and social media interventions targeted improved vaccine uptake behaviors, but little meaningful change was observed. In conclusion, digital health interventions can cost-effectively provide education about HPV vaccination, offer interactive environments to alleviate parental vaccine hesitancy, and ultimately help adolescents engage in HPV vaccine uptake. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purposeof Review: Young people face the highest number of new HIV infections globally. With today’s increasing access to smartphones, serious games have been viewed as an effective means of improving knowledge and behavioral outcomes. This systematic review describes current HIV prevention serious games and their relationship with HIV-related knowledge and behavioral outcomes. Recent Findings: A search of HIV prevention serious games was conducted using PubMed, CINAL, IEEE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. A total of 31 papers were identified, which consist of 20 studies and 11 protocols. Results for knowledge, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors were mixed. Two interventions reported improvement in PrEP usage and optimal dosing. Summary: Gaming appears to be a viable and engaging method to improve knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral outcomes to promote HIV prevention among diverse groups of adolescents and young adults globally. However, additional research is needed to understand how to implement this modality effectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Cognitive impairment occurs in up to 70% of people with MS (pwMS) and has a large impact on quality of life and working capacity. As part of the development of a smartphone-app (dreaMS) for monitoring MS disease activity and progression, we assessed the feasibility and acceptance of using cognitive games as assessment tools for cognitive domains. Methods: We integrated ten cognitive games in the dreaMS app. Participants were asked to play these games twice a week for 5 weeks. All subjects underwent a battery of established neuropsychological tests. User feedback on acceptance was obtained via a five-point Likert-scale questionnaire. We correlated game performance measures with predetermined reference tests (Spearman’s rho) and analyzed differences between pwMS and Healthy Controls (rank biserial correlation). Results: We included 31 pwMS (mean age 43.4 ± 12.0 years; 68% females; median Expanded Disability Status Scale score 3.0, range 1.0–6.0) and 31 age- and sex-matched HC. All but one game showed moderate–strong correlations with their reference tests, (|rs|= 0.34–0.77). Performance improved in both groups over the 5 weeks. Average ratings for overall impression and meaningfulness were 4.6 (range 4.2–4.9) and 4.7 (range 4.5–4.8), respectively. Conclusion: Moderate–strong correlations with reference tests suggest that adaptive cognitive games may be used as measures of cognitive domains. The practice effects observed suggest that game-derived measures may capture change over time. All games were perceived as enjoyable and meaningful, features crucial for long-term adherence. Our results encourage further validation of adaptive cognitive games as monitoring tools for cognition in larger studies of longer duration.

We aimed at assessing the change in the prevalence of healthy behaviours among children exposed to digital applications (intervention) employed for promoting healthy behaviours. We conducted a cross-sectional study before the intervention in March 2022 including a representative sample of 1500 Albanian schoolchildren (≈54% girls) aged 12-15 years. In June 2022, after 4-month exposure to digital applications aimed at promoting healthy behaviours (intervention), we carried out a second cross-sectional study in the same sample of schoolchildren. In both survey rounds, an anonymous and structured self-Administered questionnaire inquired children about a range of behavioural practices including nutrition, oral health, physical activity and hygiene practices. After the intervention, overall, there was evidence of a significant increase in the prevalence of all healthy behavioural practices measured: ~9% for breakfast consumption and/or environmental protection, 12% for toothbrushing, 14% for handwashing, 15% for leisure time physical exercise and 24% for adequate fruit and vegetable intake (all p < 0.001). Engagement in healthy behaviours only after the intervention was higher among rural children (from 18% for breakfast consumption to 37% for handwashing and/or adequate fruit and vegetable intake) and especially those pertinent to Roma/Egyptian communities (from 18% for breakfast consumption to 46% for adequate fruit and vegetable intake), except for engagement in safe environmental protection which was more prevalent among urban residents (28% vs. 15% among rural children) and ethnic Albanian children (24% vs. 13% among Roma/Egyptian children). Our findings from Albania indicate that digital applications can be useful for strengthening school-based health promotion programs. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

Method: A self-report questionnaire (Gamertest) was applied to a sample of 1,228 women (12-22 years old) (M = 14.84; SD = 2.469), selected by randomized sampling in schools in the Community of Madrid. Results: 51% of women admit gaming. The typical profile is a woman who plays VG sporadically and for short periods of time, preferably Action and Adventure games or Puzzles and Platforms, mainly on smartphones, at home and alone, with the purpose of having fun. The main predictive variables of gaming problems, identified with the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) in women are: a greater number of hours of use, playing Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), and Strategy VG. The most protective factor is playing VG accompanied. The results are discussed. © 2022: Editum. Universidad de Murcia (Spain).},

	abstract = {The validity of the constructs of problematic Internet or smartphone use and Internet or smartphone addiction has been extensively debated. The spectrum hypothesis posits that problematic online behaviors (POBs) may be conceptualized within a spectrum of related yet distinct entities. To date, the hypothesis has received preliminary support, and further robust empirical studies are still needed. The present study tested the spectrum hypothesis of POBs in an Australian community sample (n = 1,617) using a network analysis approach. Psychometrically validated self-report instruments were used to assess six types of POBs: problematic online gaming, cyberchondria, problematic cybersex, problematic online shopping, problematic use of social networking sites, and problematic online gambling. A tetrachoric correlation matrix was computed to explore relationships between online activities and a network analysis was used to analyze relationships between POBs. Correlations between online activities were positive and significant, but of small magnitude (0.051 ≤ r ≤ 0.236). The community detection analysis identified six distinct communities, corresponding to each POB, with strong relationships between items within each POB and weaker relationships between POBs. These findings provide further empirical support for the spectrum hypothesis, suggesting that POBs occur as distinct entities and with little overlap. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Although the potential of games to foster learning, representation, empowerment, well-being, and social inclusion is already documented, some groups seem to remain underrepresented. In the field of disability, this potential is still immersed in a set of barriers and hindrances, arising from the lack of accessibility of this medium and the lack of representation of voices in research and development processes. This problem seems to be exponentiated in the field of Intellectual Disability (ID). The present study describes insights from a case study developed with 14 institutionalized adults with severe ID, with two complementary aims: (a) explore the effectiveness of a PAR gaming approach in the empowerment and well-being of adults with ID living in an institutional setting; and (b) explore the feasibility of promoting accessibility in games through PAR. The proposed intervention included the development of games by higher education students for these individuals, with their active participation in all phases – conceptual definition, game design, game development, and playtesting. A total of 38 playtesting sessions and 162 gaming sessions were conducted, where systematic observation grids were filled, and pre and post-process assessments were conducted, targeting variables related to empowerment and well-being. The obtained results sustain this type of action-research design as a feasible strategy to empower people with ID and foster their well-being, through games as a form of expression and not only therapy. It also reflects on accessibility improvement through the presence of underrepresented groups (people with ID particularly) in the media creation processes that can, per se, be considered a form of empowerment. These insights also open a discussion about a potential paradigm shift toward a social model of accessibility aligned with the current views on the field of disability studies. Future studies should replicate this methodology with larger samples and in a context not aligned with the pandemic isolation. Furthermore, PAR must also be explored from a more general perspective, as a strategy to promote accessibility and participation in other media and cultural products as a whole.

	abstract = {Purpose: To assess the association between sexual orientation and screen use (screen time and problematic screen use) in a demographically diverse national sample of early adolescents in the United States. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from year 2 of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (N = 10,339, 2018–2020, ages 10–14 years). Multiple linear regression analyses estimated the association between sexual orientation and recreational screen time, as well as problematic use of video games, social media, and mobile phones. Results: In a sample of 10,339 adolescents (48.7% female, 46.0% racial/ethnic minority), sexual minority (compared to heterosexual) identification was associated with 3.72 (95% CI 2.96–4.47) more hours of daily recreational screen time, specifically more time on television, YouTube videos, video games, texting, social media, video chat, and browsing the internet. Possible sexual minority identification (responding “maybe” to the sexual minority question) was associated with 1.58 (95% CI 0.92–2.24) more hours of screen time compared to heterosexual identification. Sexual minority and possible sexual minority identification were associated with higher problematic social media, video games, and mobile phone use. Conclusions: Sexual minority adolescents spend a disproportionate amount of time engaging in screen-based activities, which can lead to problematic screen use. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Objective: Almost 80% of people, who are caring for someone with dementia, have one or more chronic conditions and require self-management support. New technologies offer promising solutions; however, little is known about what technologies caregivers use for their health or in general. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of mobile application (app) and health-related technology use among caregivers who have chronic conditions and care for someone with dementia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 122 caregivers recruited online and from communities in the Baltimore-metropolitan area. Data were collected with online surveys and computer-assisted telephone interviews. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze survey data. Results: Study participants were primarily female (95 of 122, 77.9%), middle-aged (average 53 years, standard deviation (SD) 17), well educated (average 16 years, SD 3.3), an adult child of the person with dementia (53 of 122, 43.4%), and had 4 chronic conditions on average (SD 2.6). Over 90% of caregivers used mobile apps (116 of 122), spending a range of 9 to 82 min on each app. Most caregivers reported using social media apps (96 of 116, 82.8%), weather apps (96 of 116, 82.8%), and/or music or entertainment apps (89 of 116, 76.7%). Among caregivers using each app type, more than half of caregivers used social media (66 of 96, 69%), games (49 of 74, 66%), weather (62 of 96, 65%), and/or music or entertainment apps (51 of 89, 57%) daily. Caregivers also used several technologies to support their own health—the most common being websites, mobile devices, and health-related mobile apps. Conclusion: This study supports the feasibility of using technologies to promote health behavior change and support self-management among caregivers. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {During adolescence, some youth develop anxiety disorders such as social anxiety disorder (SAD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, few studies have been conducted to understand the specific contribution of SAD and GAD to Problematic Internet Use (PIU). In order to adapt intervention strategies, a specific understanding of the contribution of each of these disorders to PIU is necessary. The goal of this study is to evaluate the unique contributions of GAD, SAD, self-esteem, gender, preferred Internet application (video game or social media) and stressful events among PIU adolescents. The sample was constituted of 2883 adolescents (44.3% boys; age 14.61 years) recruited in high schools. Two groups of problematic Internet users were formed based on their time spent on video games (PIU-VG) or social media (PIU-SM). A multinomial logistic regression model showed that self-identifying as girl, living with GAD symptoms, reporting many stressful events and low self-esteem increase the risk of PIU-SM. Likewise, self-identifying as boy, having SAD symptoms, reporting stressful events and low self-esteem increase the risk of PIU-VG. GAD appears to be specifically associated with problematic social media use and SAD with problematic video games use. Results suggest the importance of considering specific anxiety disorders in adolescent PIU evaluation and intervention. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Serious games, due to their massiveness, attractiveness, and enjoyment, are widely used for education, promoting healthy behaviors, and for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STI) . Serious game design includes tailored narratives, game mechanics, and art for their purpose. Nevertheless, using theories of attitude change to create a videogame to promote healthy behavior is less common. Following contemporary theories on persuasion, we developed and tested an RPG videogame for mobile phones, in which participants had to think in favor of the use of condoms through a series of tasks within the game in order to promote positive attitudes and consonant behavioral intention (BI). Results show a positive correlation between thoughts, attitudes, and BI, and that attitudes can partially mediate (account for) the association between thoughts and BI. In this exploratory study, we showed that 1) it was possible to include an Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)-based approach into a videogame; 2) consistent with previous studies, attitudes partially mediated the association between thoughts and condom use (BI) in a videogame environment; and 3) applications of this strategy can be considered in the game design process to build new serious games for prevention in health care.

	abstract = {Background: Syphilis has recently resurfaced as a significant public health problem. Since the 2000s, isolated syphilis outbreaks have increasingly occurred in North America, Europe, and Australia; in Brazil, there have been progressive increases in both congenital and acquired syphilis. There are several possible explanations, such as misdiagnosis of acquired syphilis, which could increase the number of untreated transmitters in the population; failure to initiate or complete treatment; and nontreatment of sexual partners (leading to reinfection). Mobile technologies have been successfully used to promote behavior changes and can positively impact treatment and follow-up adherence in patients with infectious diseases. The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate treatment and monitoring methods in patients with syphilis, including follow-up by telephone, via a game in a smartphone app, and at public health centers. Methods: The SIM study is a single-center, randomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up period. The aim is to identify the most effective method of follow-up regarding patient compliance with treatment. The tests will be performed in a mobile unit in easily accessible locations. The goal is to perform 10,000 rapid tests for syphilis. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis according to VDRL tests will be randomized to one of three arms: telephone, smartphone game, or conventional in-person follow-up. All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Conclusion: If we find differences in effectiveness, a major change in the conventional approach for this patient population may be needed, potentially affecting current Brazilian health policy strategies.

	abstract = {This document is part of a global investigation that aims to establish best practices in usability testing of mobile applications, that fit the specific needs of persons with cognitive disabilities. The motivating factor is to improve the quality of life of people with special needs. As a first step, we want to discover what are the skills of people with DS (DS) when using a mobile device. Thanks to its direct manipulation interaction style, multi-touch technology is the ideal mechanism for learning activities with a view to the social inclusion of people with DS. This paper investigates the most common touchscreen gestures on commercial existing software. A commercial analysis was carried out to discover the touch screen gestures used by 103 free software Apps running on a mobile touch screen tablet of 11 where the applications run”. The commercial analysis showed that most applications support tap and drag operations on multi-touch technology. Additionally, the research sought to discover the adults with DS (19–54 years of age) ability to perform other gestures on multi-touch surfaces. A DS user skill study was performed to assess the ability of this user segment to interact with multi-touch surfaces. The analysis involved 53 participants, aged between 19 and 54 years, from two vocational training centers attended by people with DS in Madrid. Authors used the Gesture Games App for experimenting with multi-touch gestures such as tap, double tap, long press, drag, scale up, scale down, and one-finger rotation. Tap, double tap, and drag were the three gestures that the most participant could use. In contrast, participants had difficulty performing one-finger rotation and long press gesture. Our statistical analysis showed that the ability to perform each gesture was independent of gender, age group, and previous experience with touchscreen of a participant. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.},

Recent Findings: Prevalence studies show findings that are disparate by location and vary widely by definitions being used. Impulsivity, aggression, and neuroticism potentially predispose youth to internet addiction. Cognitive behavioral therapy and medications that treat commonly co-occurring mental health problems including depression and ADHD hold considerable clinical promise for internet addiction. Summary: The inclusion of internet gaming disorder in the DSM-5 and the ICD-11 has prompted considerable work demonstrating the validity of these diagnostic approaches. However, there is also a movement for a conceptualization of the disorder that captures a broader range of media-use behaviors beyond only gaming. Efforts to resolve these approaches are necessary in order to standardize definitions and clinical approaches. Future work should focus on clinical investigations of treatments, especially in the USA, and longitudinal studies of the disorder’s etiology. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Violence against women and children is a public health issue of pandemic proportions. It is estimated that one in every three women worldwide has experienced physical, emotional, or sexual violence. Similarly, each year one out of two children are victims of some form of violence including domestic aggression and bullying. Due to the widespread use of the Internet and social media, women and children are now vulnerable to other types of violence such as cyber-bullying and online sexual or emotional harassment. To help alleviate this social problem, the use of computer science and related technologies has been leveraged in recent years. The Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, ubiquitous and mobile computing, pattern recognition, cloud computing and similar technologies, have been used to formulate solutions to detect and prevent violent acts against women and children. In this paper, a systematic review of some of the efforts that can help address the problem of violence against women and children is presented. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art of these contributions and identifies trends, architectures, technologies, and current open challenges. The survey was developed using a literature review of academic documents published from 2010 to 2020. The contributions were categorized into four application domains: online detection, offline detection, safety, and education. These contributions were further categorized based on the computer science approaches and technologies used: artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and digital serious games.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Gallery Game, deployed within the Mezurio smartphone app, targets the processes of episodic memory hypothesized to be first vulnerable to neurofibrillary tau-related degeneration in Alzheimer’s Disease, prioritizing both perirhinal and entorhinal cortex/hippocampal demands. Methods: Thirty-five healthy adults (aged 40–59 years), biased toward those at elevated familial risk of dementia, completed daily Gallery Game tasks for a month. Assessments consisted of cross-modal paired-associate learning, with subsequent tests of recognition and free recall following delays ranging from one to 13 days. Results: Retention intervals of at least three days were needed to evidence significant forgetting at both recognition and paired-associate recall test. The association between Gallery Game outcomes and established in-clinic memory assessments were small but numerically in the anticipated direction. In addition, there was preliminary support for utilizing the perirhinal-dependent pattern of semantic false alarms during object recognition as a marker of early impairment. Conclusions: These results support the need for tests of longer-term memory to sensitively record behavioral differences in adults with no diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Aggregate behavioral outcomes promote Gallery Game’s utility as a digital assessment of episodic memory, aligning with established theoretical models of object memory and showing small yet uniform associations with existing in-clinic tests. Initial support for the discriminatory value of perirhinal-targeted outcomes justifies ongoing large-sample validation against traditional biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The aim of the paper is to analyze and discuss students' attitudes towards the implementation of an emergency management exercise as a game inspired by ARGs, comprising a virtual crisis management exercise system. The study on which the paper is based was conducted using a qualitative approach together with a literature review and a thematic analysis of university students' answers to an evaluation questionnaire, following their participation in a virtual exercise with an ARG design. The findings suggest that ARG concepts have a potential in emergency management training and could be tested with rescue services staff, also across national borders.

However, commercial video games received minor attention. In this article, we describe how video game play impacted the life transformations engendered by the pandemic. We administered a qualitative online survey to 330 video game players who were living in Italy during the lockdown measures. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic altered the participants’ sense of time and space, reshaped both their intimate and wider social interactions, and elicited a wide spectrum of disturbing emotions. Players escaped from this unsatisfying reality into video game worlds, searching for a new normality that could compensate for the unpredictability and dangerousness of the pandemic life, as well as seeking uncertainty in the game environments to balance the flatness of the lockdown everydayness. In doing so, they “appropriated” the gaming technologies, which also led to several unexpected outcomes. Starting from these findings, we propose a model of escapism that points out four ways to escape from reality into video game worlds. Moreover, we outline some design implications that might inspire future strands of research in the field of crisis technologies. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Background: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has considerable potential for reducing incidence among high-risk groups, such as gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM). However, PrEP’s effectiveness is closely linked with consistent use, and a variety of individual-level barriers, including alcohol use, could impede optimal uptake and use. Web-based interventions can encourage medication adherence, HIV prevention behaviors, and responsible drinking and may help support PrEP care, particularly in resource-limited settings. Objective: We previously developed a web application called Game Plan that was designed to encourage heavy drinking GBM to use HIV prevention methods and reduce their alcohol use and was inspired by brief motivational interventions. This paper aims to describe the web-based content we designed for integration into Game Plan to help encourage PrEP uptake and consistent use among GBM. In this paper, we also aim to describe this content and its rationale. Methods: Similar to the original site, these components were developed iteratively, guided by a thorough user-centered design process involving consultation with subject-matter experts, usability interviews and surveys, and user experience surveys. Results: In addition to Game Plan’s pre-existing content, the additional PrEP components provide specific, personal, and digestible feedback to users about their level of risk for HIV without PrEP and illustrate how much consistent PrEP use could reduce it; personal feedback about their risk for common sexually transmitted infections to address low-risk perceptions; content challenging common beliefs and misconceptions about PrEP to reduce stigma; content confronting familiar PrEP and alcohol beliefs; and a change planning module that allows users to select specific goals for starting and strategies for consistent PrEP use. Users can opt into a weekly 2-way SMS text messaging program that provides similar feedback over a 12-week period after using Game Plan and follows up on the goals they set. Conclusions: Research preliminarily testing the efficacy of these components in improving PrEP outcomes, including uptake, adherence, sexually transmitted infection rates, and alcohol use, is currently ongoing. If supported, these components could provide a scalable tool that can be used in resource-limited settings in which face-to-face intervention is difficult. © Tyler B Wray, Philip A Chan, John P Guigayoma, Christopher W Kahler.

	abstract = {Diet-related chronic disease is a global health epidemic giving rise to a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. With the rise of the digital revolution, there has been increased interest in using digital technology for eating behavioural change as a mean of diet-related chronic disease prevention. However, evidence on digital dietary behaviour change is relatively scarce. To address this problem, this review considers the digital interventions currently being used in dietary behaviour change studies. A literature search was conducted in databases like PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Medline, and PsycInfo. Among 119 articles screened, 15 were selected for the study as they met all the inclusion criteria according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search strategy. Four primary digital intervention methods were noted: use of personal digital assistants, use of the internet as an educational tool, use of video games and use of mobile phone applications. The efficiency of all the interventions increased when coupled with tailored feedback and counselling. It was established that the scalable and sustainable properties of digital interventions have the potential to bring about adequate changes in the eating behaviour of individuals. Further research should concentrate on the appropriate personalisation of the interventions, according to the requirements of the individuals, and proper integration of behaviour change techniques to motivate long-term adherence. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The education of pleasant interpersonal relationships is one of the great challenges of modern physical education. Learning to live together sustainably is also learning to transform conflicts and the negative emotions elicited by them. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the GIAM pedagogical model (of the Motor Action Research Group) through cooperation-oppo-sition traditional sporting games with competition in the presence of motor conflicts (conflict trans-formation; relational well-being) and on emotional regulation (management of negative emotions; emotional well-being). Empirical research was carried out using an associative strategy (explanatory study) involving 222 secondary school students (Mage = 14.86; SD = 0.65). A seven-session pedagogical intervention was carried out based on a championship using the Marro (Prisoner’s Bar) game. The students answered two validated questionnaires of socio-emotional well-being, the Games and Emotions Scale (GES-II) and the Motor Conflict Questionnaire (MCQ), at three phases during the experience (beginning, middle, and end). The findings showed that, through the GIAM model, motor conflicts and the intensity of negative emotions were reduced. It was found that conflicts and negative emotions are part of the same phenomenon and that through an appropriate pedagogical program it is possible to turn them into experiences of socio-emotional well-being. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Introduction:Evidence has consistently shown the high efficacy of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in preventing cervical cancers. However, the HPV vaccine uptake rate in Hong Kong is very low. We will develop and evaluate an innovative, theory-based multidisciplinary team-led school-based HPV vaccination health-promotion program (MDL-SHPVP), engaging female adolescents, parents/guardians, and secondary school personnel in multicomponent educational strategies and interactive discussions.Methods and analysis:A cluster randomized controlled trial is proposed. We will recruit 2520 female adolescents and their parents/guardians from 18 secondary day schools. The MDL-SHPVP is underpinned by the Health Belief Model and Precaution Adoption Process Model. Multicomponent interventions will be offered, including education sessions with small group dialogues with a registered nurse and trained healthcare and lay volunteers, and educational computer games. A team of volunteers will be established to raise HPV, cervical cancer, and HPV vaccine awareness. Outcomes include adolescents' uptake of the HPV vaccine, adolescents' intention to receive HPV vaccination, vaccine acceptance among parents/guardians, and parents'/guardians' and adolescents' HPV knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. Data will be collected at baseline, 1 month, and 1 year after intervention. The generalized estimating equations analysis will be used for comparing the outcomes between the 2 groups.Ethics and dissemination:Ethical approval was obtained from the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Ref. no.: 2019.055). We will disseminate the study findings via peer-reviewed publications and presentations at relevant events and international and local conferences.Trial registration number:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04438291. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Over the last years several Cognitive Mobile Games (CMG) have been developed to train and challenge the brain. However, currently the level of evidence supporting the benefits of using CMG in real-life use is limited in older adults, especially at a late age. In this study we analyzed game scores and the processing speed obtained over the course of 100 sessions in 12,000 subjects aged 60 to over 80 years. Users who trained with the games improved regardless of age in terms of scores and processing speed throughout the 100 sessions, suggesting that old and very old adults can improve their cognitive performance using CMG in real-life use. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {With the outbreak of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many countries have imposed lockdowns which have caused an increase in Internet use. As large-scale disasters may have an impact on addictions, a review on Internet-based addictive behaviors seems necessary. The goals of this review are to find whether Internet-based addictive behaviors have increased during the pandemic and to define the main reasons for this increase. The systematic search was conducted in Google Scholar, Science Direct, PsycINFO, and PubMed in October of 2020, to determine the current evidence and observations concerning the Internet-based addictive behaviors amid COVID-19. Studies were included if they considered the Internet-based addictive behaviors during the current pandemic. We used all the names of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2 previously 2019 nCoV), the name of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and common Internet-based addictive behaviors, namely Internet addiction, online gaming disorder, online gambling disorder, pornography use, and smartphone use disorder. The study design is PEOs, finding if individuals’ exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in Internet-based addictive behaviors. The quality of the studies was assessed independently by two authors using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The articles found in this review proved an increase in Internet-based addictive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic mostly due to financial hardships, isolation, problematic substance use, and mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress. Effective interventions should be scaled up to prevent and reduce online addictive behaviors, as well as accessible guidelines, particularly for adolescents. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, communications have innovated with the emergence of the internet and mobile telephony (smartphone). Undoubtedly, this technological innovation has favored every sector of the worldwide population, thanks to the various forms of interaction in communication. Therefore, the aim of this essay focuses on the analysis of the literature about constructs of the internet and Smartphone addiction, and how this symptom has become present in the user population. For this purpose, a review of the literature on the subject is carried out, which allows us to identify some aspects that relate to both constructs. In the final reflections from the analyzed literature, we observe that some elements that most influence internet addiction are: leisure, online games, random games, cybersex, social networks to interact with other people, and sometimes to search for information. About this, it has already been reported in several studies, however, a question arises, has little been seen or at least it was not located, that the use of the internet is being the preferred channel of people to their academic training?, or just forced by the global health contingency? Today, the worldwide activity will no longer be the same after the COVID-19 pandemic that we are suffering from, and it is possible that the teaching-learning processes will frequently be taught through the different electronic media, hence this technology is emerging to be an agent of change in education worldwide. © 2021 The authors.

	abstract = {Based on the general assumption that even problematic behaviours are associated with an inherently health-promoting motivation to cope with unpleasant or unsatisfying life situations, the compensatory model of media use focuses on how psychosocial vulnerabilities moderate links between media behaviours and adverse outcomes. The present paper means to further develop this approach by exploring the moderating role of state- and trait-level factors (state: perceived stress; trait: social interaction anxiety and loneliness) on the relation between video game consumption (i.e. playing duration and habitual gaming), motivations (i.e. achievement, social, immersion), and engagement (harmonious and obsessive engagement) within a large-scale sample of mostly heavy gamers. Overall, results provided further evidence for the compensatory approach, with perceived stress emerging as a critical psychosocial factor that intensified positive and negative relations between several gaming behaviours and harmful outcomes. Moreover, our results reiterated the heuristic importance of intra- and interpersonally pressured (i.e. obsessive) engagement to explain adverse gaming outcomes as well as self-determined (i.e. harmonious) engagement as a potentially fruitful gateway toward more healthy gaming. These findings constitute solid empirical groundwork that may contribute to effective prevention and intervention methods against problematic gaming. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) was included in the DSM-5 in 2013 as a condition requiring further research, and gaming disorder (GD) was included in the ICD-11 in 2018. Given the importance of including these conditions in diagnostic guidelines, a review was conducted to describe their prevalence. Methods: Using guidance from the Joanna Briggs Institute and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), we conducted a rapid scoping review. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane library were searched for literature published from inception to July 2018. All review stages were pilot-tested to calibrate reviewers. The titles/abstracts and full-text articles were screened by one reviewer to include quantitative primary studies that reported GD or IGD prevalence. Excluded citations were screened by a second reviewer to confirm exclusion. Charting was conducted by one reviewer and verified by another, to capture relevant data. Results were summarized descriptively in tables or text. Results: We assessed 5550 potentially relevant citations. No studies on GD were identified. We found 160 studies of various designs that used 35 different methods to diagnose IGD. The prevalence of IGD ranged from 0.21-57.50% in general populations, 3.20-91.00% in clinical populations, and 50.42-79.25% in populations undergoing intervention (severe cases). Most studies were conducted in the Republic of Korea (n = 45), China (n = 29), and the USA (n = 20). Results are also presented for severe IGD and by geographic region, gender/sex, and age groups (child, adolescent, adult). The five most frequently reported health-related variables were depression (67 times), Internet addiction (54 times), anxiety (48 times), impulsiveness (37 times), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (24 times). Conclusions: Due to the variability in diagnostic approaches, knowledge users should interpret the wide IGD prevalence ranges with caution. In addition to further research on GD, consensus on the definition of IGD and how it is measured is needed, to better understand the prevalence of these conditions. © 2020 The Author(s).},

However, rewards have also been shown to improve decision making in adolescence. Our goal was to determine if peer observation and reward effects on decision-making were dependent upon adolescent driving styles. Twenty-four healthy adolescents played a driving game in a 2 (no peer; peer) × 2 (no rewards; rewards) within-subjects experiment. Driving styles were measured by self-report. Rewards favoring safe choices reduced risky decision making, but this effect was especially robust for adolescents with driving styles that increase risk of MVCs (i.e., dangerous, fast, angry, or distracted styles). Findings suggest that rewards for safe driving can be an effective mechanism for reducing MVCs, especially for the most at-risk drivers, if they can be made appetizing to adolescents. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC), one of the causes of maternal and child mortality is a lack of medical knowledge and consequently the inability to seek timely healthcare. Mobile health (mHealth) technology is gradually becoming a universal intervention platform across the globe due to ubiquity of mobile phones and network coverage. MANTRA is a novel mHealth intervention developed to tackle maternal and child health issues through a serious mobile game app in rural Nepal, which demonstrated a statistically significant knowledge improvement in rural women. This paper explores the perceptions and usability of the MANTRA app amongst rural women and Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) in Nepal. Despite the challenges of a target user group with limited educational levels and low smartphone experience, all participants viewed the MANTRA app with approval and enthusiasm. They were willing to engage further with the mHealth intervention and to share their experience and knowledge with fellow community members. Participants also showed an increase in awareness of danger signs enabling them to make better informed health decisions in the future. FCHVs viewed the app as a validation tool providing and support for greater impact of their efforts in rural Nepal. Growing mobile ownership, network coverage and availability of smartphones along with acceptance of the prototype MANTRA app in rural communities suggest encouraging prospects for mHealth interventions to be incorporated in the national health infrastructure in Nepal and other LMICs. © Copyright © 2021 Kayastha, Mueller, Yadav, Kelman, Boscor, Saville, Arjyal, Baral, Fordham, Hearn and Kostkova.},

Independent and interactive effects of HIV status and cocaine dependence were examined using 2 × 2 factorial ANCOVA with premorbid IQ (WRAT-4: WR) as the covariate. We found cocaine dependence had a significant adverse effect on overall IGT performance (p = 0.015). We also found individuals who were HIV-positive tended to have less total money at the end of the game than individuals who were HIV-negative (p = 0.032), suggesting individuals living with HIV had less focus on long-term gains and more focus on short-term gains.

A purposive sampling technique was used for sample selection, as data collection before and after interventions were carried out using pre and post-test instruments. After the validation process, and field tests were carried out to determine the effectiveness of the products, with the results showing that instructional-based gaming applications were effective in improving healthy and clean-living knowledge. The game topics observed included personal & environmental hygiene, sports, as well as healthy food and drink. Students considered using instructional-based gaming as motivation to learn, in order to develop healthy and clean-living behaviors, which were proposed in the cloud platform of their respective schools. This game also encouraged students' active and dynamic learning, due to the fact that it helped with various interesting activities, therefore, increasing daily healthy and clean-living behaviors. The implication of this study is that students should be diligent in maintaining cleanliness, loving exercise, and always selecting healthy food to consume. The novelty of this study is that games are observed as an early childhood team, which are responsible for improving the knowledge of clean-living and healthy behaviors. © 2021.

	abstract = {Avatars or agents are digitized self-representations of a player in mediated environments. While using agents to navigate through mediated environments, players form bonds with their self-agents or characters, a process referred to as identification. Identification can involve automatic, but temporary, self-concept “shifts in implicit self-perceptions” (Klimmt et al., 2010, p. 323) of the media user by adopting or emphasizing the action choices on behalf of the social expectation of the avatar in the mediated environment. In the current study, we test the possibility that users' identification with video game avatars–a bond built between avatars and players- would account for subsequent behavior changes. We did so by using 3-month longitudinal data involving a narratively-based serious game: Socially Optimized Learning in Virtual Environments (SOLVE), a 3D-interactive game designed to reduce risky sexual behaviors among young men who have sex with men (n = 444). Results show that video game identification predicts both the reduction of risky sexual behaviors over time, and reduction in the number of non-primary partners with whom risky sex occurs. And when players identify with the game character, they tend to make healthier choices, which significantly mediates the link between video game identification and reduction of risky behaviors. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Christensen, Smith, Gillig, Jeong, Liu, Appleby, Read and Miller.},

	abstract = {Multiple intersecting stigmas and discrimination related to sex, gender, HIV, and race/ethnicity may challenge HIV prevention and treatment service utilization, particularly among youth. This scoping review describes recent and ongoing innovative mobile health (mHealth) interventions among youth in the United States that aim to reduce stigma as an outcome or as part of the intervention model. To identify examples of stigma-mitigation via mHealth, we searched peer-reviewed published literature using keyword strategies related to mHealth, HIV, stigma, and youth (ages 10 to 29). We identified eleven articles that met our inclusion criteria, including three describing data from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), five describing pilot studies, one describing the process evaluation of an ongoing intervention, one describing formative work for intervention development, and one published study protocol for an ongoing intervention. We review these articles, grouped by HIV prevention and care continuum stages, and describe the mHealth approach used, including telehealth, simulation video games, motion comics, smartphone applications (apps), social media forums, online video campaigns, video vignettes, and a computerized behavioral learning module. Four studies focused on preventing primary acquisition through individual-level behavior change (e.g., reducing condomless anal intercourse), three focused on increasing HIV testing, three focused on linking to prevention services [e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)] and one focused on promoting adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Our review did not identify any published studies using mHealth with a primary aim to reduce stigma as a way to improve care engagement and increase viral suppression among youth in the United States. Additional RCTs and implementation studies examining the effectiveness of mHealth stigma-reduction interventions on HIV-related outcomes are needed to end the HIV epidemic among youth. mHealth offers unique advantages to address the complex intersecting stigma barriers along the HIV continuum to improve HIV-related outcomes for youth.  © mHealth.

	abstract = {Background and aims: Behavioral addictions such as gambling and gaming disorder are significant public health issues that are of increasing importance to policy makers and health care providers. Problem gambling and gaming behaviors have been identified as being associated with externalizing and internalizing problems, with theoretical models suggesting that both conduct problems and depressive symptoms may be significant risk factors in the development of problem gambling and gaming. As such, the purpose of this systematic review is to provide an overview of research identifying the relationship between conduct problems, depressive symptoms and problem gambling and gaming among adolescents and young adults. Methods: Systematic literature searches in accordance with PRISMA guidelines found 71 eligible studies that met the inclusion criteria, 47 for problem gambling, 23 for problem gaming and one for both problem behaviors. Results: Based on cross-sectional evidence, both problem gambling and gaming are consistently concurrently associated with conduct problems and depressive symptoms. Longitudinal evidence appears to be clearer for conduct problems as a risk factor for problem gambling, and depressive symptoms as a risk factor for problem gaming. However, both risk factors appear to increase the risk for these problem behaviors. Discussion and Conclusions: Results from the literature review suggest that problem gambling and gaming are associated with the presence of conduct problems and depressive symptoms, with the potential of sharing common etiological factors. Additional research is necessary to confirm these longitudinal relationships with an emphasis on investigating the interaction of both early conduct problems and depressive symptoms.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Traditional methods for screening and diagnosis of alcohol dependence are typically administered by trained clinicians in medical settings and often rely on interview responses. These self-reports can be unintentionally or deliberately false, and misleading answers can, in turn, lead to inaccurate assessment and diagnosis. In this study, we examine the use of user-game interaction patterns on mobile games to develop an automated diagnostic and screening tool for alcohol-dependent patients. Our approach relies on the capture of interaction patterns during gameplay, while potential patients engage with popular mobile games on smartphones. The captured signals include gameplay performance, touch gestures, and device motion, with the intention of identifying patients with alcohol dependence. We evaluate the classification performance of various supervised learning algorithms on data collected from 40 patients and 40 age-matched healthy adults. The results show that patients with alcohol dependence can be automatically identified accurately using the ensemble of touch, device motion, and gameplay performance features on 3-minute samples (accuracy=0.95, sensitivity=0.95, and specificity=0.95). The present findings provide strong evidence suggesting the potential use of user-game interaction metrics on existing mobile games as discriminant features for developing an implicit measure to identify alcohol dependence conditions. In addition to supporting healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making, the game-based self-screening method could be used as a novel strategy to promote alcohol dependence screening, especially outside of clinical settings. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study examines long bone diaphyseal rigidity and shape of hunter-gatherers at Roonka to make inferences about subsistence strategies and mobility of inhabitants of semi-arid southeastern Australia. Roonka is a cemetery site adjacent to the Lower Murray River, which contains over 200 individuals buried throughout the Holocene. Archaeological evidence indicates that populations living near this river corridor employed mobile, risk averse foraging strategies. Methods: This prediction of lifestyle was tested by comparing the cross-sectional geometric properties of the humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, and fibula of individuals from Roonka to samples of varying subsistence strategies. Bilateral asymmetry of the upper limb bones was also examined. Results: Roonka males and females have moderately high lower limb diaphyseal rigidity and shape. In the upper limb, females have low rigidity and bilateral asymmetry while males have moderately high rigidity and bilateral asymmetry. This pattern is similar to other foraging groups from Australia and southern Africa that have behaviorally adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Discussion: Lower limb results suggest that populations in the Lower Murray River Valley had relatively elevated foraging mobility. Upper limb rigidity and bilateral asymmetry indicate a sexual division of labor at Roonka. Females resemble other samples that had mixed subsistence strategies that involved hunting, gathering, and processing tasks. Males display a pattern similar to groups that preferentially hunted large game, but that supplemented this source with smaller game and riverine resources. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: Childhood obesity is an important public health problem. Children with overweight or obesity often tend to show the pediatric inactivity triad components; these involve exercise deficit disorder, pediatric dynapenia, and physical illiteracy. The aim of the study was to examine the influence of an active video games (AVG) intervention combined with multicomponent exercise on muscular fitness, physical activity (PA), and motor skills in children with overweight or obesity. (2) Methods: A total of 29 (13 girls) children (10.07 ± 0.84 years) with overweight or obesity were randomly allocated in the intervention group (AVG group; n = 21) or in the control group (CG; n = 8). The intervention group performed a 5-month AVG training using the Xbox 360® with the Kinect, the Nintendo Wii®, dance mats, and the BKOOL® interactive cycling simulator, combined with multicomponent exercise, performing three sessions per week. The control group continued their daily activities without modification. Weight, PA using accelerometers, and motor competence using the Test of Gross Motor Development 3rd edition were measured. Muscular fitness was evaluated through the Counter Movement Jump height, maximal isometric strength of knee extension and handgrip strength, and lean mass using Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry. Mann–Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed. The biserial correlation coefficients (r) were calculated. Spearman’s correlation coefficients among PA, muscular fitness, and motor competence variables were also calculated. (3) Results: The AVG group significantly increased their knee extension maximal isometric strength (4.22 kg; p < 0.01), handgrip strength (1.93 kg; p < 0.01), and jump height (1.60 cm; p < 0.01), while the control group only increased the knee extension maximal isometric strength (3.15 kg; p < 0.01). The AVG group improved motor competence and light physical activity (p < 0.05) and decreased sedentary time (p < 0.05). Lean mass improved in both AVG group and CG (p < 0.05). Lastly, the percentage of improvement of motor skills positively correlated with the percentage of improvement in vigorous PA (r = 0.673; p = 0.003) and the percentage of improvement in CMJ (r = 0.466; p = 0.039). (4) Conclusions: A 5-month intervention combining AVG with multicomponent training seems to have positive effects on muscle fitness, motor competence, and PA in children with overweight or obesity. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Relationship Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (ROCD) is a presentation of OCD centering on interpersonal relationships. The aim of this Randomized Control Trial (RCT) was to assess the efficacy of short, game like, daily cognitive interventions delivered via mobile application in reducing subclinical ROCD symptoms and associated phenomena. Methods: Fifty university students identified as having subclinical levels of ROCD symptoms (using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Clinical Version) were randomized into: immediate-use group (iApp group; n = 25) and delayed-use group (dApp group; n = 25). The iApp group started using the evaluated cognitive-behavioral training application at baseline for 15 days (T0 to T1). The dApp group commenced using the application at T1 for 15 days (T1 to T2). All participants completed questionnaires at baseline (T0), 15 days from baseline (T1), and 30 days from baseline (T2). Results: Repeated measure MANOVAs showed significant Group (iApp vs. dApp) × Time (T0 vs. T1) interactions. These interactions indicated greater decrease in ROCD symptoms, OCD beliefs and social anxiety symptoms, as well as a greater increase in self-esteem in the iApp group compared to dApp group at T1. Moreover, the Reliable Change Index (RCI) indicated reliable change on ROCD symptoms for a significant portion of participants (42–52%). Limitations: Sample size and the use of self-report measures limits the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: Short, daily cognitive training interventions delivered via mobile applications may be useful in reducing subclinical ROCD symptoms and associated features. Further testing is needed for clinical populations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Adolescence, a period of physical, social, cognitive and emotional development, repre-sents a target population for sexual health promotion and education when it comes to achieving the 2030 Agenda goals for sustainable and equitable societies. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of what is known about the dissemination and effectiveness of sex education programs and thereby to inform better public policy making in this area. Methodology: We carried out a systematic review based on international scientific literature, in which only peer-reviewed papers were included. To identify reviews, we carried out an electronic search of the Cochrane Database Re-views, ERIC, Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, Scopus and PsycINFO. This paper provides a nar-rative review of reviews of the literature from 2015 to 2020. Results: 20 reviews met the inclusion criteria (10 in school settings, 9 using digital platforms and 1 blended learning program): they fo-cused mainly on reducing risk behaviors (e.g., VIH/STIs and unwanted pregnancies), whilst obvi-ating themes such as desire and pleasure, which were not included in outcome evaluations. The reviews with the lowest risk of bias are those carried out in school settings and are the ones that most question the effectiveness of sex education programs. Whilst the reviews of digital platforms and blended learning show greater effectiveness in terms of promoting sexual and reproductive health in adolescents (ASRH), they nevertheless also include greater risks of bias. Conclusion: A more rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of sexual education programs is necessary, especially regarding the opportunities offered by new technologies, which may lead to more cost-effective interventions than with in-person programs. Moreover, blended learning programs offer a promising way forward, as they combine the best of face-to-face and digital interventions, and may provide an excellent tool in the new context of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Due to its high ecological validity, virtual reality (VR) technology has emerged as a powerful tool for mental health research. Despite the wide use of VR simulations in research on mental illnesses, the study of addictive processes through the use of VR environments is still at its dawn. In a systematic literature search, we identified 38 reports of research projects using highly immersive head-mounted displays, goggles, or CAVE technologies to provide insight into treatment mechanisms of addictive behaviors. So far, VR research has mainly addressed the roles of craving, psychophysiology, affective states, cognition, and brain activity in addiction. The computer-generated VR environments offer very realistic, dynamic, interactive, and complex real-life simulations requesting active participation. They create a high sense of immersion in users by combining stereoscopic three-dimensional visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile perceptions, tracking systems responding to user movements, and social interactions. VR is an emerging tool to study how proximal multi-sensorial cues, contextual environmental cues, as well as their interaction (complex cues) modulate addictive behaviors. VR allows for experimental designs under highly standardized, strictly controlled, predictable, and repeatable conditions. Moreover, VR simulations can be personalized. They are currently refined for psychotherapeutic interventions. Embodiment, eye-tracking, and neurobiological factors represent novel future directions. The progress of VR applications has bred auspicious ways to advance the understanding of treatment mechanisms underlying addictions, which researchers have only recently begun to exploit. VR methods promise to yield significant achievements to the addiction field. These are necessary to develop more efficacious and efficient preventive and therapeutic strategies. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Although many benefits emerge from the growing capabilities of smartphones, there are also concerns related to the long-term hyper-connected experience. Based on a systematic mapping method, this study investigates the primary factors of problematic smartphone use (PSU). Initially, this mapping considered ten academic databases, which allowed the analysis of 436 studies, and the creation of a taxonomy that categorises technology addiction topics such as the Internet, Smartphones, Video games, and Electronic devices. After the initial search and filtering, the study selected and deeply analysed 115 articles concerning the PSU influences on mental health, proposing a taxonomy to classify mental disorders and common symptoms related to PSU. The outcomes suggest that those who fear missing out on important events, females, depressed, anxious, and bored people are prone to PSU, reinforcing the importance of understanding the factors that lead a person to use smartphones in a problematic way and alternatives to help people cope with PSU. Scales such as the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) and strategies such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and limiting smartphone access are being used to handle PSU. Finally, this study presents implications and recommendations for future research in this area. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We address this issue to find out the type of videos that Spanish and British teenage tiktokers are uploading to this social network. Methodology: Using content analysis methodology, 447 videos from 12 British and 12 Spanish tiktokers aged between 11 and 17 with more than half a million followers are studied. It provides analysis by nationality and a comparative view of both nationalities. Results: Contents created and disseminated by both genders and nationalities are video-selfies, choreographies, and videos with a fun purpose. Results show 16 and 17-year-old are the most active on this social network. Spanish and British teenagers create and disseminate videos with similar content. They show is age, not gender, determining variable for their digital productions. It is observed boys abandon video games to give way to a more protagonist self-representation in this social network. Discussion and conclusions: There is a lack of plurality in the type of content created and disseminated on TikTok by both genders and nationalities. It is interesting to note the attenuation of the traditional gender roles that teenagers show in their audio-visual productions on TikTok, which reflect the possible gender-related development into their behavior on social networks. © 2021, University of La Laguna.

The presented methodology is universal and can be used for corpus recording for different languages. We present an analysis of speech recognition systems and voice interfaces for driver monitoring systems based on the analysis of both audio and video data. Multimodal speech recognition allows using audio data when video data are useless (e.g. at nighttime), as well as applying video data in acoustically noisy conditions (e.g., at highways). Our methodology identifies the main steps and requirements for multimodal corpus designing, including the development of a new framework for audio-visual corpus creation. We identify the main research questions related to the speech corpus creation task and discuss them in detail in this paper. We also consider some main cases of usage that require speech recognition in a vehicle cabin for interaction with a driver monitoring system. We also consider other important use cases when the system detects dangerous states of driver's drowsiness and starts a question-answer game to prevent dangerous situations. At the end based on the proposed methodology, we developed a mobile application that allows us to record a corpus for the Russian language. We created RUSAVIC corpus using the developed mobile application that at the moment a unique audiovisual corpus for the Russian language that is recorded in-the-wild condition.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to long periods of sedentary behavior, and unhealthy diets gamers and esports players are at risk for numerous chronic diseases and all-cause mortality. Health research has started addressing the public health implications of the esports phenomenon, drawing a bleak picture of this megatrend. However, instead of just highlighting adverse public health implications of this trend, it is recommended to become involved in this phenomenon and positively influence it. Esports has an enormous potential for physical activity and health-promoting efforts, provides a context for broadly disseminating interventions, and offers new ways of gaining access to an often-neglected population. This paper presents: the potential of the esports phenomenon to promote physical activity, health, and well-being in gamers and esports players; the strategic and preventive solutions to ameliorate esports possible adverse health impacts; and the utilization of esports technology (streams, media platforms, exergames, etc.) as an innovative health promotion tool, especially reaching gamers and esports players with attractive and interactive interventions. This is to encourage systematic scientific research so that evidence-based guidelines and intervention strategies involving regular physical activity, healthy diet, and sleep hygiene for esports will be developed. The goal is to promote public health approaches that move toward a better integration of esports and gaming. Copyright © 2021 Ketelhut, Martin-Niedecken, Zimmermann and Nigg.},

	abstract = {This study deals with the uncertainty in defining behavioral addictions (BAs). BAs are characterized by specific compulsive behaviors, regardless of potential negative consequences. However, to differentiate a behavior from a leisure activity to an addictive one is still an object of debate in the literature. Accordingly, this study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Behavioral Addictions Questionnaire (BAQ) as a possible screening tool for multiple BAs (i.e., shopping, food addiction, gambling, sex, work, exercise, Internet, videogames, and smartphone). BAQ aims to give a dimensional and quantitative assessment of addictive behaviors in a continuum, including both the adaptive and maladaptive features of the behaviors. Five hundred and seventy-six healthy adults (age range: 18–88) participated in the study, completing a survey including the BAQ questionnaire. Considering both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, statistical examination suggested good psychometric properties, with adequate validity in all its subscales (i.e., the goodness of fit). Moreover, also higher reliability was confirmed for each dimension detected (i.e., all alpha over 0.65). The BAQ represents a comprehensive screening instrument that benefits from appropriate validity and reliability for assessing BAs. Therefore, it can be used in clinical fields and research. Moreover, the feature of BAs on a continuum, and the severity index adopted by the study, can help from a preventive perspective. However, further validation of the BAQ is needed in other countries and contexts. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Encouraging Mexican men who have sex with men (MSM) to learn about and get tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is essential not only to initiate early treatment and reduce complications related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) but also to avoid new infections. HIV testing for MSM in Mexico remains a challenge, in part because of the stigma and discrimination they face in their daily lives and perceived discrimination in health care services. Thus, innovative approaches are needed to increase the uptake of health prevention services among this population. Games for health and gamification are now established approaches to achieving desired behavior change. Gamified interventions have been successfully deployed in various health domains, including HIV awareness, treatment, and prevention. The aim of this 2015 study was to develop a phone-based game and linked online platform with gamification elements to incentivize HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing, normalize asking partners about serostatus, and increase HIV and STI knowledge among young Mexican MSM. This paper describes its implementation process and feasibility assessment. Methods: The study consisted of three phases. The first phase was the formative research, which consisted of 6 focus groups and rapid prototyping to determine the most effective and appropriate design for the intervention. The second phase consisted of piloting and implementing the intervention over five weeks among 62 MSM, aged between 18 and 35 years old. Lastly, we assessed the feasibility of the intervention over three dimensions: acceptability, demand, and implementation. We conducted ten semi-structured interviews with participants and used a mixed-methods approach, including qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods. Results: Overall, the conceptual components of the intervention were perceived as acceptable, which leads us to believe that the formative phase captured our participants’ needs and perceptions. However, we underestimated the complexity of the technical challenges involved. Participants’ high standards and expectations of an interactive product based on their experience with industrially produced games impacted their patterns of use. Nevertheless, they perceived the platform as a good-quality information source. Gamification elements such as badges, points, and prizes were perceived as fun, exciting, and motivating, and 71% of participants engaged in at least one activity to earn points. Conclusions: A game-based intervention, coupled with an online platform that incorporates gamification elements to motivate HIV and STI testing in young Mexican MSM is feasible. Successfully scaling such an intervention to a broader audience would require reducing the complexity of the intervention, working with a local technical partner to develop and implement a more efficient platform, improving the quality of the graphics, and a re-design of the point system. © mHealth.

Suspecting that voice communication usage facilitates the social capital formation. We also investigated the role of perceived anonymity as a confounding variable. To test our hypothesis, a quantitative research was carried out. The study focuses on the subsequent elements: voice application usage; perceived anonymity; and the presence of the following forms of social capital: bonding social capital and bridging social capital. Data collection was based on surveys spread in the online environment and resulted in a sample of 102 respondents. Based on quasi-experimental design we obtained data that display higher mean scores on bonding and bridging social capital scales on the experiment group (voice communication users) than in control group (non-voice communication users). Also, control group have a lower score on the perceived anonymity scale. One explanation for our results could be that voice communication reduces perceived anonymity and individuals that consider themselves as having a low level of anonymity engage in more controlled behaviors that in turn facilitate the formation of social capital. © 2021, National University of Political Studies and Public Administration.

	abstract = {Background: According to DSM-5 criteria, Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficiencies in social communication and interaction along with the presence of restrictive and repetitive patterns of behavior. Few studies have explored the prevalence of behavioral addiction in individuals with ASD. Since addiction and ASD share common characteristics, individuals with ASD may be more vulnerable to addictive behaviors. Some typical behavioral addictions include internet, gaming, and gambling addiction. While most previous studies on ASD and addiction have looked at chemical addiction, behavioral addiction has not been thoroughly studied to date. Aims: The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of behavioral addiction among individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Methods and procedures: A systematic literature search of five databases was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Search results were reviewed for the predetermined inclusion criteria independently by two authors. Outcomes and results: The search yielded 539 publications after the removal of duplicates. 61 met the inclusion criteria for title and abstract review. Full texts were reviewed resulting in an additional 31 being removed. The remaining 30 included 4 case reports and 26 original studies. Results included 27 studies that found a positive correlation (15 of significance, 12 of unknown significance) between a behavioral addiction and either ASD or Autistic traits, 1 found a significant negative correlation, 3 did not find a correlation. Conclusions and implications: This review is inconclusive about links between ASD and behavioral addictions. While a vast majority of studies show a positive correlation, many do not provide the statistical analysis to show if the correlations are significant. In addition, a positive correlation between ASD and behavioral addiction is observed in the presence of comorbid mental health conditions in many of the studies. Further research with proper controls and statistical analysis is needed to determine whether the development of behavioral addiction is directly influenced by ASD or if the presence of a comorbid mental health condition is the true cause. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: eHealth systems provide new opportunities for the delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence interventions for adolescents. They may be more effective if grounded in health behavior theories and behavior change techniques (BCTs). Prior reviews have examined the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of these eHealth systems. However, studies have not systematically explored the use of health behavior theories and BCTs in the design of these applications. Objective: The purpose of this review was to explore whether health behavior theories and BCTs were considered to ground designs of eHealth systems supporting adolescents' (10-24 years) ART adherence. More specifically, we examined which specific theories and BCTs were applied, and how these BCTs were implemented as design features. Additionally, we investigated the quality and effect of eHealth systems. Methods: A systematic search was performed on IEEE Xplore, ACM, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from 2000 to 2020. Theory use and BCTs were coded using the Theory Coding Scheme and the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1), respectively. Design features were identified using the lenses of motivational design for mobile health (mHealth). The number of BCTs and design features for each eHealth system and their prevalence across all systems were assessed. Results: This review identified 16 eHealth systems aiming to support ART adherence among adolescents. System types include SMS text message reminders (n=6), phone call reminders (n=3), combined SMS text message and phone call reminders (n=1), electronic adherence monitoring devices (n=3), smartphone apps (n=1), smartphone serious games (n=1), gamified smartphone apps (n=1), leveraging existing social media (n=2), web-based applications (n=1), videoconferencing (n=1), and desktop applications (n=1). Nine were grounded in theory, of which 3 used theories extensively. The impact of adolescent developmental changes on ART adherence was not made explicit. A total of 42 different BCTs and 24 motivational design features were used across systems. Ten systems reported positive effects on 1 or more outcomes; however, of these ten systems, only 3 reported exclusively positive effects on all the outcomes they measured. As much as 6 out of 16 reported purely no effect in all the outcomes measured. Conclusions: Basic applications (SMS text messaging and phone calls) were most frequent, although more advanced systems such as mobile apps and games are also emerging. This review indicated gaps in the use of theory and BCTs, and particularly the impact of developmental changes on ART adherence was not adequately considered. Together with adopting a developmental orientation, future eHealth systems should effectively leverage health theories and consider developing more advanced systems that open the door to using BCTs more comprehensively. Overall, the impact of eHealth systems on adolescent ART adherence and its mediators is promising, but conclusive evidence on effect still needs to be provided. © Alemitu Mequanint Bezabih, Kathrin Gerling, Workeabeba Abebe, Vero Vanden Abeele.

Young people can find in it practical recommendations about seven areas of health and a game through which they can consolidate the acquired knowledge on different healthy and beneficial elements. Healthy Jeart is also useful for healthcare professionals and educators. The latter can find in it educational proposals in the subject that can be implemented in schools and challenges in which they can get students to participate and compete. Healthy Jeart has been awarded the distinction of Health App by the Andalusian Agency for Health Quality and is supported by the Community Nursing Association (CNA) at the national level. Healthy Jeart is a health promotion tool that was created with a low cost; however, the impact on the physical, psychological and social well-being of young people is expected to be high. The present article describes its design, production, revision and evaluation process. The design of this tool required knowing how young people perceived it and determining the contents that should be included in it. Such information was gathered through eight nominal groups. Once the first prototype was available, this was tested with a sample of adolescent students. With the accreditation procedure, given the attended improvements to pass it, the current version of the application was reached. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To review existing literature about fertility and sexuality of boys born with complex congenital genitourinary anomalies. Methods: A Pubmed review was performed in December 2018 to identify the most relevant original manuscripts regarding male complex congenital conditions affecting the urogenital system in male patients including spina bifida (SB), bladder exstrophy–epispadias complex (BEEC) and hypospadias. A comprehensive review was drafted exploring sexual dysfunction from a medical, psychosexual, surgical and reproductive point of view during transition from childhood (or adolescence) to adulthood. Results: About 75% of men with SB have erectile dysfunction (ED) (Gamé et al. in Urology 67(3):566–570, 2006; Diamond et al. in 58(4):434–435, 1986). Most SB patients have impaired sexual development mainly due to diminished self-esteem, dependence on caregivers and lack of privacy (Blum et al. in Pediatrics 88(2):280–285, 1991). Men with BEEC have fewer intimate relationships than women because of the greater difficulties with issues regarding their genitalia and sexual activities (Deans et al. in Am J Obstet Gynecol 206(6):496.e1–496.e6, 2012). However, a good quality of life is achievable with the effective use of coping strategies (Deng et al. in Transl Androl Urol 7:941, 2018; Rikken et al. in BMC Womens Health 18(1):163, 2018; Friedler et al. in Reprod Biomed Online 32(1):54–61, 2016). Chordee occurs in 25% of all hypospadias patients. More severe hypospadias is related to a greater risk for complications. The long-term sexual quality of life (QoL) in men who underwent hypospadias surgery is influenced by a lot of factors. Therefore, an interactive and dynamic biopsychosocial model of sexual QoL was proposed. Conclusions: The care of patients with congenital urologic conditions becomes a challenge especially in the period of ‘transition’. The goal of follow-up is a holistic management viewed from a medical, psychosexual, surgical end reproductive point. All patients should be asked for specific urinary, fecal or sexual concerns. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND. MRI use and the need for monitored anesthesia care (MAC) in children have increased. However, MAC is associated with examination delays, increased cost, and safety concerns. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success rate of nonsedated neuroradiologic MRI studies in children 1–7 years old and to investigate factors associated with success. METHODS. We retrospectively reviewed data from our institutional nonsedated MRI program. Inclusion criteria were outpatient nonsedated MRI referral, age 1–7 years old, and neuroradiologic indication. Exclusion criteria were MRI examinations for ventricular checks and contrast material use. Success was determined by reviewing the clinical MRI report. We recorded patient age and sex, type of MRI examination (brain, spine, craniospinal, head and neck, and brain with MRA), protocol length, presence of child life specialist, video goggle use, and MRI appointment time (routine daytime appointment or evening appointment). We used descriptive statistics to summarize patient demographics and clinical data and logistic regression models to evaluate predictors of success in the entire sample. Subset analyses were performed for children from 1 to < 3 years old and 3 to 7 years old. RESULTS. We analyzed 217 patients who underwent nonsedated MRI examinations (median age, 5.1 years). Overall success rate was 82.0% (n = 178). The success rates were 81.4% (n = 127) for brain, 90.3% (n = 28) for spine, 71.4% (n = 10) for craniospinal, 66.7% (n = 6) for head and neck, and 100% (n = 7) for brain with MRA. Age was significantly associated with success (odds ratio [OR], 1.33; p = .009). In children 1 to < 3 years old, none of the factors analyzed were significant predictors of success (all, p > .48). In children 3–7 years old, protocol duration (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–0.99; p = .02) and video goggle use (OR, 6.38; 95% CI, 2.16–18.84; p = .001) were significantly associated with success. CONCLUSION. A multidisciplinary approach with age-appropriate resources enables a high success rate for nonsedated neuroradiologic MRI in children 1–7 years old. CLINICAL IMPACT. Using age as the primary criterion to determine the need for MAC may lead to overuse of these services. Dissemination of information regarding nonsedated MRI practice could reduce the rate of sedated MRI in young children. © American Roentgen Ray Society},

	abstract = {Objectives: The objective of the study was to assess correlations between practising sports at an elite level at a young age, and the current physical activity level, selected sociometric features and the severity of menopausal symptoms in women during perimenopause, which will contribute to the knowledge about undertaking sports activity. Material and methods: The study involved a total of 334 females aged 45–65. They were purposefully assigned to both a study and control group. The study group included 148 women — former elite athletes qualified based on the presumed criteria. The control group consisted of 154 women who did not meet the criterion of practising sports activity earlier in life. In order to conduct the study, we applied the method of a diagnostic survey. The outcome measure was a survey questionnaire and contained questions concerning sociometric features, some elements of gynaecological history, and physical activity undertaken in the past. The second part used the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Blatt-Kupperman Menopausal Index. Results: The groups were homogenous in terms of age and BMI. The former athletes most frequently used to practise athletics, team games and swimming. Both groups displayed no differences regarding the age at menarche, the onset of sexual activity, and the presence and regularity of menstruation. The former athletes had fewer children compared to the controls. They manifested a higher level of physical activity in particular areas and intensity categories. The comparison between the two groups did not show statistically significant differences in the severity of menopausal symptoms. conclusions: Sports training in the past differentiates selected sociometric features such as economic activity and a numerous pregnancies and births. Sports training in the past has an impact on the current level of physical activity — the females who used to train present its higher level. Sports training in the past does not differentiate the severity of menopausal symptoms. Copyright © 2021 Via Medica},

	abstract = {Background: Encouraging consistent use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is essential for reducing HIV incidence, particularly among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), and especially those who engage in heavy drinking. Although practice guidelines recommend providing adherence counseling to PrEP patients, clinics and providers may not have the resources or expertise to provide it. Internet-facilitated interventions have been shown to improve HIV prevention outcomes, including medication and care adherence. Game Plan is a website we created to help users make a tangible plan for reducing their HIV risk. We designed additional components of Game Plan to address key individual level barriers to PrEP use. Objective: The aim of this mixed methods research is to test the usability and user experience of these components with intended users: GBM who drink heavily and are on PrEP. Methods: In study 1 (usability), we completed a detailed individual interview in which participants (n=10) walked through a prototype of the website, thinking aloud as they did, and completed a follow-up interview and web-based survey afterward. Study 2 (user experience) involved providing participants (n=40) with a link to the prototype website to explore on their own and asking them to complete the same follow-up survey afterward. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze quantitative data. Results: Users in both studies gave the website excellent ratings for usability, overall satisfaction, and quality, and most often described the site as informative, helpful, and supportive. Users also rated the site's content and feel as respectful of them and their autonomy, empathetic, and they stated that it conveyed confidence in their ability to change. The study 1 interviews highlighted the importance of the website's esthetics to the participants' engagement with it and its credibility in prompting genuine reflection. Conclusions: GBM who reported heavy drinking and used PrEP generally found a website focused on helping them to create a plan to use PrEP consistently to be helpful. Adopting user-centered design methods and attending to the esthetics of mobile health interventions are important steps toward encouraging engagement and reducing at-risk behaviors. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc..

	abstract = {In India, gender inequalities have deleterious effects on reproductive health outcomes among women and girls. This study used an interactive storytelling game as a qualitative data collection approach to learn about adolescents’ experiences and societal norms regarding gender. Eight sessions were conducted with a total of 30 girls and 10 boys (ages 15–17). Participants created characters, themes, and locations for the stories and shared experiences about gender through their characters. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, translated, and analysed for emergent themes. Themes included: interest in and prevalence of romantic relationships among adolescents, stigma associated with adolescent relationships and its influence on individual norms, and girls’ experiences of harassment. Findings suggest that the use of a qualitative storytelling game is one way to understand the experiences of adolescents around sensitive issues such as gender. They also suggest a need for interventions focused on improving gender attitudes among adolescents, fostering parent–child communication, and strengthening the policy response to girls’ harassment. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite the well-known beneficial health effects of physical activity (PA), the majority of Dutch primary school children do not meet the recommended PA guidelines. Although there is growing evidence on the effectiveness of exergames for PA in children, there is limited evidence on their effect on health outcomes, such as cardiovascular health and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and on factors influencing their effectiveness and feasibility. The exergame BOOSTH uses a wrist-worn activity tracker to measure steps per day. As a reward for the performed PA, children can unlock levels in the online BOOSTH game. In addition, “BOOSTH battle” enables competition between groups. Objective: This protocol describes a cluster randomized controlled trial in 16 primary schools in the Netherlands investigating the effect of BOOSTH on moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) using accelerometry. Secondary aims are to investigate the feasibility of BOOSTH (mixed methods: questionnaires and focus group interviews) and its effect on cardiovascular risk factors (anthropometrics, blood pressure, and retinal microvasculature) and HRQOL. Methods: Stratification variables and relevant variables related to outcomes (such as BMI [z-score], sex, age, and parenting style) and/or missingness will be taken into account. Measurements will be performed at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. Results: The study has received funding from Province Limburg (SAS-2015-04956) and received ethical approval from the Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht University Medical Centre (METC172043/NL64324.068.17). The results of the analyses are expected to be published in 2021. Conclusions: With this study, the ability of the exergame BOOSTH to increase PA and improve health in children of primary school age will be investigated. The insights into effectiveness and feasibility will result in scientific and societal recommendations, which could potentially contribute to widespread implementation of exergames for children. ©Gabrielle ten Velde, Guy Plasqui, Maartje Willeboordse, Bjorn Winkens, Anita Vreugdenhil.},

	abstract = {Background: Nutrition and diet-related non-communicable diseases are a major cause of death worldwide. Food preferences and eating behaviours are likely to be established during adolescence, making it an important period to promote healthy behaviours. Aim: To review the effectiveness of gamification to improve fruit and vegetable intake in adolescents. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using eight databases and grey literature sources for articles published to date on the effectiveness of gamification on fruit and vegetable intake in adolescents. Search criteria included articles that were complete and peer reviewed, conducted empirical research, described gamified elements used, focused on individuals between 10 and 24 years, and were available in English. Results: Out of 402 studies identified by the search, 7 were included in the review. Overall, short-term gamified interventions showed promise in improving fruit and vegetable intake in those aged 10 to 24 years old. Gamification was primarily facilitated through extrinsic motivation (i.e. points, badges, vouchers, leaderboard, narration, avatars, challenges) rather than intrinsic motivation (i.e. team-based competition). Studies were moderate in quality and key methodological issues related to non-randomized study design, lack of comparison group, inadequate control for confounding, and small sample size. Conclusions: Gamification can be an effective tool in changing nutrition-related behaviour in adolescents over the short term. Future research should consider gamified interventions that are of longer duration, incorporate additional intrinsic gamified elements, tailor game elements for population subgroups, and address methodological issues. © The Author(s) 2020.},

Background: Although video gaming has become a pervasive part of adolescents' daily life that can lead to educational, physical, psychological, and social problems, there is ongoing debate as to whether this is an addiction, and there is little evidence about treatment effectiveness. Method: This process research used a case study design and conducted individual semistructured interviews with 10 male adolescents and 11 parents after they had completed a treatment program. Results: Four treatment components (individual counseling, family counseling, group mentoring and social support, and alternative activities) were generally found to be useful. Counselors were able to engage the adolescents and serve as role models in gaming through creative use of technology. Conclusion: Practitioners working with adolescents with gaming disorder should attend to their developmental needs pertaining to gaming, health, psychosocial, and educational aspects relevant to the Asian context. Implications: Practitioners should go beyond counseling rooms and adopt different strategies to reach out and work with adolescents who are struggling with excessive gaming in different therapeutic settings via engaging and working with them in individual, family, and group contexts using technology, particularly video games. © 2020 National Council on Family Relations},

Fun For Wellness (FFW) is a novel online intervention grounded in self-efficacy theory and intended to improve multidimensional well-being and physical activity through multi-modal methods. These strategies include capability-enhancing opportunities, learning experiences such as games, video vignettes, and self-assessments. RCT studies have suggested that FFW is efficacious in improving subjective and domain-specific well-being, and effective in improving mental health, physical health, physical activity, and self-efficacy in United States. adults who are overweight and in the general population. The present study uses qualitative and quantitative user experience data collected during two RCT trials to understand and evaluate engagement with FFW, its drivers, and its outcomes. Results suggest that FFW is enjoyable, moderately engaging, and easy to use; and contributes to positive outcomes including skill development and enhanced confidence, for both overweight individuals and the general adult population. Drivers of engagement appear to include rewards, gamification, scenario-based learning, visual tracking for self-monitoring, ease of use and simple communications, and the entertaining, interactive nature of program activities. Findings indicate that there are opportunities to streamline and simplify the experience. These results can help improve FFW and contribute to the science of engagement with online interventions designed to improve well-being. © Copyright © 2021 Scarpa, Prilletensky, McMahon, Myers, Prilleltensky, Lee, Pfeiffer, Bateman and Brincks.},

Sports injury (SI) is a multifactorial event where many internal and external, proximal and remote factors play a role in a recursive way, including physical and psychological variables. Accordingly, many voices expressing the need of tackling that and several prevention programs have arisen. Nevertheless, different barriers and limitations prevent a wide extension of well-controlled programs, closely monitored by highly specialized professionals in ordinary sports grass-root organizations. These have helped flourishing different low intensity (LI)-interventions and e-Health apps focusing on both physical warmup, training and fitness, and mental skills aimed at reducing athlete’s vulnerability to SIs. This kind of intervention usually uses self-administered techniques and/or non-specialized staff that can effectively monitoring the program. In fact, LI-interventions have shown to be effective coping with different health and psychological issues. However, these interventions face an important challenge: the lack of engagement people usually show. The current paper proposes how gamification can contribute to the engagement to such interventions. Based on the mechanics–dynamics–aesthetics framework to analyze game design, the paper suggests a set of guidelines app-and web-LI interventions aimed at preventing SIs should include to foster motivation and reduce attrition. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Objectives: Physical activity in people with dementia (PwD) may enhance physical and mental functioning. Exergaming, which combines physical exercise with cognitive stimulation in a gaming environment, was developed to overcome barriers in performing physical activities. We evaluated the effects of exergaming in day care centers (DCCs) for PwD and informal caregivers (ICs). Design: A randomized controlled trial among 23 DCCs across the Netherlands randomized to exergaming (interactive cycling during 6 months) or a care-as-usual control group. Setting and Participants: A total of 112 (73 exergaming, 39 control) community-dwelling dyads (PwD, IC), with the PwD visiting a DCC at least twice per week. Methods: All outcomes were assessed using structured questionnaires during interviews with PwD and ICs at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), and 6 months (T2). Primary outcomes: physical activity and mobility of the PwD. Secondary outcomes: physical, cognitive, emotional and social functioning, and quality of life for PwD. For ICs: experienced burden, quality of life, and positive care experiences. Results: Mixed-model analyses showed no statistically significant effects on primary outcomes. There were statistically significant positive effects on PwD's secondary outcomes at T2 on cognition [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): r = 2.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65, 3.96, P = .007; and Trail Making Test part A (TMT-A): r = −28.98, 95% CI: −54.89, −3.08, P = .029], social functioning (Behavior Observation Scale for Intramural Psychogeriatrics subscale 1 (GIP): r = −1.86, 95% CI: −3.56, −0.17, P = .031), and positive post-test effects in ICs on distress caused by the PwD's neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q total distress: r = −3.30, 95% CI: −6.57, −0.03, P = .048) and on sense of competence (SSCQ: r = 2.78, 95% CI: 0.85, 4.71, P = .005). Conclusions and Implications: Exergaming appeared not effective on the primary outcomes. Despite the study being underpowered, we found positive effects on secondary outcomes for PwD and ICs, and no negative effects. We therefore recommend further study, dissemination, and implementation. © 2020 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine},

	abstract = {The use of virtual reality in spatial cognition evaluation has been growing rapidly, mainly because of its potential applications in the training and diagnosis of cognitive impairment and its ability to blend experimental control and ecological validity. However, there are still many gray areas on virtual reality, notably on the sense of presence and its complex relationship to task performance. Performance in VR is often suggested to be influenced by other human factors including, amongst others, cybersickness, gender, video game experience, and field dependence. Would an individual experiencing more presence systematically show better performance? This study aimed to be part of a framework of virtual reality as this question is fundamental for rigorous assessment and diagnostics, and particularly in the spatial cognition field. Forty-eight healthy young subjects were recruited to take part in a virtual spatial cognition evaluation. Spatial cognition performance, along with their level of presence, cybersickness, video game experience, gender and field dependence, were measured. Matrix correlations were used, along with linear regressions and mediation analysis. Results show that presence promoted performance on the spatial cognition evaluation, while cybersickness symptoms hindered it, notably among women. The presence—performance relationship was not mediated by other human factors. Video game experience significantly predicted both sense of presence and cybersickness, the latter two being negatively correlated. Even if women experienced more negative symptoms than men, gender appears less informative than cybersickness and video game experience. Field dependence was not associated with any other variable. Results are discussed by confronting two theories of cognition (representational vs. ecological), highlighting that virtual reality is not a simple transposition of reality but truly a new paradigm with its own biases favoring some individuals more than others, and that some human factors have to be controlled for rigorous uses of virtual environments, particularly for spatial cognition evaluation.

	abstract = {Video games have continued to increase in popularity. While the growth has been substantial, representation and acceptance of women throughout gaming environments, including those with traditional sport influences such as NBA2K, a basketball simulation game, have been lacking. Recently however, the NBA2K franchise added Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) player avatars to the NBA2K20 game. While this recent inclusion of WNBA avatars may be a great step in improving upon the concerning state of inclusion and representation of women throughout gaming, the reactions to and receptions of this change have not been fully explored. As a result, the current investigation, led by the tenets of hegemonic masculinity and bottom-up framing, sought to examine the perceptions of NBA2K fans, enthusiasts, and participants in regards to this change made by the NBA2K franchise in an effort to more fully understand the culture of gaming in relation to the treatment of women/girls. This objective was accomplished via an analysis of comments made through the social media application Instagram on the NBA2K20 WNBA inclusion announcement post. The Instagram comments were coded and analyzed through the use of the qualitative software Leximancer, which conducts thematic and semantic analysis on written words as well as visual text. Results revealed perceptions of the WNBA avatars embroiled with displays of hegemonic masculinity, demonstrating that the negative sentiments and framing women face within traditional sport settings are weaved within the virtual sport game simulations as well. © 2021},

	abstract = {Background: International asthma guidelines recommend the monitoring of peak expiratory flow (PEF) as part of asthma self-management in children and adolescents who poorly perceive airflow obstruction, those with a history of severe exacerbations, or those who have difficulty controlling asthma. Measured with a peak flow meter, PEF represents a person's maximum speed of expiration and helps individuals to follow their disease evolution and, ultimately, to prevent asthma exacerbations. However, patient adherence to regular peak flow meter use is poor, particularly in pediatric populations. To address this, we developed an interactive tablet-based game with a portable game controller that can transduce a signal from the user's breath to generate a PEF value. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the concordance between PEF values obtained with the game controller and various measures derived from conventional pulmonary function tests (ie, spirometry) and to synthesize the participants' feedback. Methods: In this cross-sectional multicenter study, 158 children (aged 8-15 years old) with a diagnosis or suspicion of asthma performed spirometry and played the game in one of two hospital university centers. We evaluated the correlation between PEF measured by both the game controller and spirometry, forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), and forced expiratory flow at 25%-75% of pulmonary volume (FEF25-75), using Spearman correlation. A Bland-Altman plot was generated for comparison of PEF measured by the game controller against PEF measured by spirometry. A post-game user feedback questionnaire was administered and analyzed. Results: The participants had a mean age of 10.9 (SD 2.5) years, 44% (71/158) were female, and 88% (139/158) were White. On average, the pulmonary function of the participants was normal, including FEV1, PEF, and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC). The PEF measured by the game controller was reproducible in 96.2% (152/158) of participants according to standardized criteria. The PEF measured by the game controller presented a good correlation with PEF measured by spirometry (r=0.83, P<.001), with FEV1 (r=0.74, P<.001), and with FEF25-75 (r=0.65, P<.001). The PEF measured by the game controller presented an expected mean bias of -36.4 L/min as compared to PEF measured by spirometry. The participants' feedback was strongly positive, with 78.3% (123/157) reporting they would use the game if they had it at home. Conclusions: The game controller we developed is an interactive tool appreciated by children with asthma, and the PEF values measured by the game controller are reproducible, with a good correlation to values measured by conventional spirometry. Future studies are necessary to evaluate the clinical impact this novel tool might have on asthma management and its potential use in an out-of-hospital setting. © Khadidja Chelabi, Fabio Balli, Myriam Bransi, Yannick Gervais, Clement Marthe, Sze Man Tse.

	abstract = {The behavioral dynamics underlying the expansion of Homo sapiens into Europe remains a crucial topic in human evolution. Owing to poor bone preservation, past studies have strongly focused on the Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP) stone tool record. Recent excavations and extensive radiocarbon dating at Bacho Kiro Cave (Bulgaria) pushed back the arrival of IUP H. sapiens into Europe to ca. 45,000 years ago. This site has exceptional bone preservation, and we present the study of 7431 faunal remains from across two IUP layers (I and J) and one Middle Paleolithic layer (K). We identified a shift in site use and occupation intensity through time, marked by increased find density and human modifications in Layer I. Alongside a decrease in carnivore presence and seasonality data demonstrating human presence in all seasons, this indicates a more frequent or prolonged occupation of the site by IUP groups. Contrarily, the dietary focus across the IUP and Middle Paleolithic layers is similar, centered on the exploitation of species from a range of habitats including Bos/Bison, Cervidae, Equidae, and Caprinae. While body parts of large herbivores were selectively transported into the site, the bear remains suggest that these animals died in the cave itself. A distinct aspect of the IUP occupation is an increase in carnivore remains with human modifications, including these cave bears but also smaller taxa (e.g., Canis lupus, Vulpes vulpes). This can be correlated with their exploitation for pendants, and potentially for skins and furs. At a broader scale, we identified similarities in subsistence behavior across IUP sites in Europe and western Asia. It appears that the first IUP occupations were less intense with find densities and human modifications increasing in succeeding IUP layers. Moreover, the exploitation of small game appears to be limited across IUP sites, while carnivore exploitation seems a recurrent strategy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {COVID-19 prevention behaviors may be seen as self-interested or prosocial. Using American samples from MTurk and Prolific (total n = 6850), we investigated which framing is more effective—and motivation is stronger—for fostering prevention behavior intentions. We evaluated messaging that emphasized personal, public, or personal and public benefits of prevention. In initial studies (conducted March 14–16, 2020), the Public treatment was more effective than the Personal treatment, and no less effective than the Personal + Public treatment. In additional studies (conducted April 17–30, 2020), all three treatments were similarly effective. Across all these studies, the perceived public threat of coronavirus was also more strongly associated with prevention intentions than the perceived personal threat. Furthermore, people who behaved prosocially in incentivized economic games years before the pandemic had greater prevention intentions. Finally, in a field experiment (conducted December 21–23, 2020), we used our three messaging strategies to motivate contact-tracing app signups (n = 152,556 newsletter subscribers). The design of this experiment prevents strong causal inference; however, the results provide suggestive evidence that the Personal + Public treatment may have been more effective than the Personal or Public treatment. Together, our results highlight the importance of prosocial motives for COVID-19 prevention. © 2021, The Author(s).},

This article describes the iterative design and development of Interactive Narrative System for Patient-Individualized Reflective Exploration (INSPIRE), a narrative-centered behavior change environment for adolescents focused on reducing alcohol use. INSPIRE is designed to serve as an extension to clinical preventive care, engaging adolescents in a theoretically grounded intervention for health behavior change by leveraging 3D game engine and interactive narrative technologies. Methods: Adolescents were engaged in all aspects of the iterative, multiyear development process of INSPIRE through over 20 focus groups and iterative pilot testing involving more than 145 adolescents. Qualitative findings from focus groups are reported, as well as quantitative findings from small-scale pilot sessions investigating adolescent engagement with a prototype version of INSPIRE using a combination of questionnaire and interaction trace log data. Results: Adolescents reported that they found INSPIRE to be engaging, believable, and relevant to their lives. The majority of participants indicated that the narrative's protagonist character was like them (84%) and that the narrative featured virtual characters that they could relate to (79%). In the interactive narrative, the goals most frequently chosen by adolescents were “stay in control” (60%) and “do not get in trouble” (55%). Conclusions: With a strong theoretical framework (social-cognitive behavior change theory) and technology advances (narrative-centered learning environments), the field is well positioned to design health behavior change systems that can realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine},

There is little to guide game for health (G4H) designers in integrating the science of behavior change with the art of game design. Objective: The aim of this study is to extend the Behaviour Change Wheel program planning model to develop Challenges for Healthy Aging: Leveraging Limits for Engaging Networked Game-Based Exercise (CHALLENGE), a G4H centered on increasing physical activity in insufficiently active older women. Methods: We present and apply the G4H Mechanics, Experiences, and Change (MECHA) process, which supplements the Behaviour Change Wheel program planning model. The additional steps are centered on identifying target G4H player experiences and corresponding game mechanics to help game designers integrate design elements and G4H objectives into behavioral interventions. Results: We identified a target behavior of increasing moderate-intensity walking among insufficiently active older women and key psychosocial determinants of this behavior from self-determination theory (eg, autonomy). We used MECHA to map these constructs to intervention functions (eg, persuasion) and G4H target player experiences (eg, captivation). Next, we identified behavior change techniques (eg, framing or reframing) and specific game mechanics (eg, transforming) to help realize intervention functions and elicit targeted player experiences. Conclusions: MECHA can help researchers map specific linkages between distal intervention objectives and more proximal game design mechanics in games for health. This can facilitate G4H program planning, evaluation, and clearer scientific communication. © Michael C Robertson, Tom Baranowski, Debbe Thompson, Karen M Basen-Engquist, Maria Chang Swartz, Elizabeth J Lyons.},

	abstract = {Mobile dating apps like Tinder became very popular among young adults, and, in contrast to mobile dating websites, they were designed to create a more game-like experience. While it is well documented that seeking entertainment is one core motivation for mobile dating app use, the social nature of entertainment has garnered less attention. Therefore, in this paper we draw on research on entertainment in dating apps and the socio-physical contexts of use to identify patterned behaviors of heterosexual users. To do this, we employed a qualitative multi-phase research approach. First, we conducted 20 interviews with mobile dating app users. Based on the findings from that study, we conducted gender-specific focus groups and a discourse analysis to explore the social phenomena identified in phase one. Our findings suggest the fun of mobile dating is not just interacting with potential matches through the apps, but the use of the apps among one’s friends. These “dating games” are entertaining, but importantly mitigate potential social or physical risks of mobile dating. Unsurprisingly, notions of “play” across the interview, focus group, and discourse analyses reflect highly gendered practices surrounding mobile dating apps and different risks associated with such games. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Video games are popular and ubiquitous aspects of human culture, but their relationships to psychological and neurophysiological traits have yet to be analyzed in social-evolutionary frameworks. We examined the relationships of video game usage, motivations, and preferences with autistic and schizotypal traits and two aspects of neurophysiology, reaction time and targeting time. Participants completed the Autism Quotient, Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, a Video Game Usage Questionnaire, and two neurophysiological tasks. We tested in particular the hypotheses, motivated by theory and previous work, that: (1) participants with higher autism scores would play video games more, and participants with higher schizotypy scores would play video games less; and (2) autism and positive schizotypy would be associated with opposite patterns of video game use, preferences and motivations. Females, but not males, with higher autism scores played more video games, and exhibited evidence of relatively male-typical video game genre preferences and motivations. By contrast, positive schizotypy was associated with reduced video game use in both genders, for several measures of game use frequency. In line with previous findings, males played video game more than females did overall, preferred action video games, and exhibited faster reaction and targeting times. Females preferred Puzzle and Social Simulation games. Faster reaction and targeting times were associated with gaming motives related to skill development and building behavior. These findings show that gaming use and patterns reflect aspects of psychology, and gender, related to social cognition and imagination, as well as aspects of neurophysiology. More generally, the results suggest that video game use is notably affected by levels of autistic and schizotypal traits, and that video games may provide an evolutionarily novel medium for imaginative play in which immersive play experiences can be decoupled from social interaction.

	abstract = {Low social integration is commonly described in acutely suicidal individuals. Neural mechanisms underlying low social integration are poorly understood in depressed and suicidal patients. We sought to characterize the neural response to low social integration in acutely suicidal patients. Adult depressed patients within 3 days of a suicide attempt (n = 10), depressed patients with suicidal ideation (n = 9), non-suicidal depressed patients (n = 15), and healthy controls (N = 18) were administered the Cyberball Game while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. We used complementary functional connectivity and region of interest data analysis approaches. There were no group differences in functional connectivity within neural network involving the pain matrix, nor in insula neural activity or the insula during either social inclusion. Superior anterior insula activity exhibited an inverted U-shaped curve across the suicide risk spectrum during social inclusion. Superior insula activity during social inclusion correlated with depression severity and psychological pain. Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activity during social exclusion correlated with physical pain severity. Neural responses in the anterior insula significantly correlated with depression severity and with psychological pain during social inclusion, whereas dACC activity significantly correlated with physical pain during social exclusion. Recent suicidal behavior seems associated with a distinct neural response to social exclusion independently of presence of depression or suicidal thoughts. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

	abstract = {Objective: To describe concussion characteristics among general college students and compare postinjury outcomes to intercollegiate student athletes. Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: Large university in the Southeast region of the United States. Participants: A total of 179 (N=179) college students’ (female=120; 67.0%; 23.9±3.9 years) and 49 athletes’ (female=28, 57.1%;19.3±1.3 years) medical records were examined. Participants self-reported injury mechanism, health history information, and completed clinical assessments acutely (<7 days postinjury). Main Outcome Measures: Descriptive statistics were calculated for each group. Concussion outcomes between students with and without certain health history diagnoses were assessed using separate t tests. We conducted univariate regression analyses to determine if sex, age, and time from concussion to first clinical assessment were significant predictors of clinical outcomes. Statistically significant variables were included as covariates in a series of 1-way analyses of covariance to identify differences in balance, symptom severity, total symptom presence, and neurocognitive domain performance between students and athletes. Fisher exact tests were used to compare health history information between groups (α<0.05). Results: Among students, 24% reported sustaining a concussion while participating in recreational sports, and 27% of impacts occurred to the back of the head. Students had higher proportions of headache, migraine, anxiety, and depression (P<.05). Students reported greater total symptom presence (P=.006) and performed worse on the computerized neurocognitive test domain score for complex attention (P=.015) relative to athletes. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for better access to medical care for non– National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctioned athletes because of a large proportion of concussions in the student sample being sustained during sports participation. Identifying common injury mechanisms can provide clinicians with powerful information to improve evaluation and treatment models. © 2021},

	abstract = {Background: Two strategies of the US Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative are early diagnosis of infections via widespread testing and prevention of new infections using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). These strategies are particularly important for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) who are disproportionately affected by HIV, particularly if they identify as Black and/or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and others (LGBTQ+). This study will develop and test an interactive life-simulation game in which players can enact real-life behaviors and receive their HIV risk profile to improve HIV testing and PrEP access among AYAs aged 13-24 years in Washington, DC. Objective: This mixed methods study aims to determine the acceptability of an interactive, enhanced life-simulation game prototype among AYAs, conduct a pilot test of the gaming intervention among a small cohort of AYAs to ensure game usability and acceptability, and evaluate the efficacy of the game in a randomized controlled study with AYAs at risk for HIV in Washington, DC. Methods: This research protocol will be conducted in 3 phases. A formative phase will involve surveys and focus groups (n=64) with AYAs living in the DC area. These focus groups will allow researchers to understand youth preferences for game enhancement. The second phase will consist of a pilot test (n=10) of the gaming intervention. This pilot test will allow researchers to modify the game based on formative results and test the planned recruitment and data collection strategy with intended end users. The third phase will consist of a randomized controlled study among 300 AYAs to examine the efficacy of the life-simulation game compared with app-based HIV educational materials on HIV and PrEP in changing HIV testing, knowledge, risk behaviors, and PrEP access. Participants will have unlimited access to either the life-simulation game or the educational app for 3 months from the time of enrollment. Study assessments will occur at enrollment and at 1, 3, and 6 months post enrollment via e-surveys. At 6 months, a subset of intervention participants (n=25) will participate in in-depth exit interviews regarding their experience being in the study. Results: Institutional review board approval was received on February 5, 2020. This project is currently recruiting participants for the formative phase. Conclusions: This interactive life-simulation intervention aims to increase HIV testing and PrEP access among AYAs in the DC area. In this intervention, players can enact real-life behaviors and receive their HIV risk profile to promote HIV testing and PrEP seeking. Such an intervention has great potential to improve knowledge of HIV and PrEP among AYAs, increase motivation and self-efficacy related to HIV testing and PrEP use, and decrease individual and structural barriers that often preclude engagement in HIV prevention services. © 2021 JMIR Research Protocols.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, many new technologies have emerged, such as portable computers, the internet and smartphones, which have contributed to improving the lives of individuals. While the benefits of these new technologies are overwhelmingly positive, negative consequences are experienced by a minority of individuals. One possible negative aspect of new technologies is their problematic use due to impulsive use which may lead to lower life satisfaction. The present study investigated the mediating role of problematic video gaming (PVG) and problematic Facebook use (PFU) in the relationship between impulsivity dimensions and life satisfaction as well as the relationship between impulsivity dimensions and problematic behaviors. Additionally, the potential impact of gender differences was also examined. The study comprised 673 gamers (391 females) aged 17–38 years (M = 21.25 years, SD = 2.67) selected from 1365 individuals who completed an offline survey. PFU was assessed using the Facebook Intrusion Scale, and PVG was assessed using the nine-item Internet Gaming Disorder Scale–Short-Form (IGDS9-SF). Impulsivity dimensions such as attention, cognitive instability, motor, perseverance, self-control, and cognitive complexity were assessed using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), and life satisfaction was assessed using the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Depending on the specific impulsivity dimension, findings showed both positive and negative relationships between impulsivity and life satisfaction. Attention and perseverance subtypes of impulsivity were primarily associated with problematic behaviors. Additionally, cognitive complexity was associated with PFU among female gamers, whereas cognitive instability was associated with PVG among male gamers. Additionally, PVG was primarily associated with lower life satisfaction. However, there was no mediation effects between impulsivity dimensions and life satisfaction via PFU or PVG. These findings provide a better understanding of the relationship between problematic behaviors, life satisfaction, and impulsivity among gamers and the differences between male and female gamers. © 2020 Cudo et al.

	abstract = {Background: Globally, 3 out of 20 children experience sexual abuse before the age of 18 years. Educating children about sexual abuse and prevention is an evidence-based strategy that is recommended for ending child sexual abuse. Digital games are increasingly being used to influence healthy behaviors in children and could be an efficient and friendly approach to educating children about sexual abuse prevention. However, little is known on the best way to develop a culturally sensitive game that targets children in Africa—where sexual education is still taboo—that would be engaging, effective, and acceptable to parents and caretakers. Objective: This study aimed to develop a socioculturally appropriate, mobile-based game for educating young children (<5 years) and parents and caretakers in Tanzania on sexual abuse prevention. Methods: HappyToto children’s game was co-designed with 111 parents and caretakers (females: n=58, 52.3%; male: n=53, 47.7%) of children below 18 years of age and 24 child experts in Tanzania through surveys and focus group discussions conducted from March 2020 to April 2020. From these, we derived an overview of topics, sociocultural practices, social environment, and game interface designs that should be considered when designing child sexual abuse prevention (CSAP) education interventions. We also conducted paper prototyping and storyboarding sessions for the game’s interface, storylines, and options. To validate the application’s prototype, 32 parents (females: n=18, 56%; males: n=14, 44%) of children aged 3-5 years and 5 children (females: n=2, 40%; males: n=3, 60%) of the same age group played the game for half an hour on average. The parents undertook a pre-post intervention assessment on confidence and ability to engage in CSAP education conversations, as well as exit surveys on the usability and sociocultural acceptability of the game, while children were quizzed on the topics covered and their enjoyment of the game. Results: Parents and caregivers showed interest in the developed game during the conducted surveys, and each parent on average navigated through all the parts of the game. The confidence level of parents in talking about CSAP increased from an average of 3.56 (neutral) before using the game to 4.9 (confident) after using the game. The ability scores, calculated based on a range of topics included in CSAP education talks with children, also increased from 5.67 (out of 10) to 8.8 (out of 10) after the game was played. Both confidence level and ability scores were statistically significant (P<.001). All 5 children were interested in the game and enjoyed the game-provided activities. Conclusions: The HappyToto game can thus be an effective technology-based intervention for improving the knowledge and skills of parents and children in CSAP education. © Maria Proches Malamsha, Elingarami Sauli, Edith Talina Luhanga.

Objective: To assess the impact of ASTHMAXcel Adventures, a gamified, guideline-based, pediatric version on asthma control, knowledge, health care utilization, and patient satisfaction. Methods: Pediatric patients with asthma received the ASTHMAXcel Adventures mobile intervention on-site only at baseline (visit 1), 4 months (visit 2), and 6 months (visit 3). The asthma control test, asthma illness representation scale–self-administered, pediatric asthma impact survey, and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 were used to assess asthma control, knowledge, and patient satisfaction. Patients reported the number of asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and oral prednisone use. Results: A total of 39 patients completed the study. The proportion of controlled asthma increased from visit 1 to visits 2 and 3 (30.8% vs 53.9%, P = .04; 30.8% vs 59.0%, P = .02), and largely seen in boys. The mean asthma illness representation scale–self-administered scores increased from baseline pre- to postintervention, with sustained improvements at visits 2 and 3 (3.55 vs 3.76, P < .001; 3.55 vs 3.80, P = .001; 3.55 vs 3.99, P < .001). The pediatric asthma impact survey scores improved from baseline to visits 2 and 3 (43.33 vs 34.08, P < .001; 43.33 vs 31.74, P < .001). ED visits and prednisone use significantly decreased from baseline to visits 2 and 3 (ED: 0.46 vs 0.13, P = .03; 0.46 vs 0.02, P = .02; prednisone use, 0.49 vs 0.13, P = .02; 0.49 vs 0.03, P = .003. Satisfaction was high with mean client satisfaction questionnaire score of approximately 30 (out of 32) at all visits.

Unlike conventional branding practices that do not generally engage users as co-creators in the early discovery stages of the design process, in this research young people were brought into the design process as informants and co-designers. This drove both brand strategy and touchpoint design, positioning the brand to be better accepted by the young people involved in the programme. A series of discovery and evaluation co-design workshops, with a diverse range of PSSP youth leaders, offered game-like interactive activities and the opportunity for open discussions. Engaging young people in fun and meaningful ways helped them uncover and share insights that could only be possible by directly involving them in the design process. The outputs of this co-designed brand – FRANK – incorporated a full visual identity and a proposal for an online platform. The final brand design elicited strong positive responses from PSSP youth leaders, highlighting the importance of involving young people in the design of products and services that address issues affecting them. © 2020, Intellect Ltd..

	abstract = {Current psychological models for the development of specific internet-use disorders consider predisposing core characteristics (e.g. biopsychological constitution, psychopathology, early childhood experiences, and personality traits) that are involved in the early behavioral addiction process. The cross-sectional study discussed in this paper examined several likely relevant psychological variables in a group of 820 video gamers (217 women, 597 men), who visited the world's largest trade fair for video games in 2018. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess the extent of pathological gaming, Big Five personality traits, self-efficacy, depression symptoms, and general life satisfaction. In comparison to individuals with unproblematic gaming behavior, gamers with problematic gaming behavior scored significantly higher for neuroticism, depression symptoms, and time spent playing; and lower for self-efficacy, extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness. No difference was found in terms of agreeableness. Gamers who preferred to play massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) or first-person shooter games (FPS) presented particularly high levels of time spent playing and increased problematic gaming behavior. When considering the entire group of 820 video gamers, high levels of depressive symptoms and neuroticism, extensive time spent playing, as well as low levels of conscientiousness were identified as significant predictor variables regarding problematic gaming. In total, 238 of the 820 video gamers (29.0%) demonstrated problematic gaming behaviors. © 2020},

	abstract = {Wadi Madamagh, situated in the southern Levant, was occupied by humans during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 26,500–19,000 years ago). The climatic and environmental conditions are reflected in the faunal assemblage, which derives from Late Upper Paleolithic and Early Epipaleolithic deposits. Zooarchaeological methods and a human behavioral ecology framework are applied to examine human hunting strategies, site occupation intensity, and population mobility. Taxonomic and skeletal representation reveal that the residents of Wadi Madamagh were efficient hunters who predominantly targeted prime-aged animals, namely wild goat (Capra aegagrus), and transported whole carcasses back to the site. The rarity of small game indicates that human hunters were able to rely nearly exclusively on wild goat populations for meat and did not need to shift down to less cost-effective small game resources. The presence of bezoar goat (Capra aegagrus), waterfowl, and aurochs (Bos primigenius) indicates that during the height of the LGM, the Petra region retained more moisture than today, and wetlands were located close to the site. Compared to contemporaneous sites in the region, the focus on wild goats is unusual but is not unexpected given the rocky, rugged landscape around Wadi Madamagh. In combination with other markers of site occupation intensity, the faunal assemblage suggests that Wadi Madamagh was home to repeated, light occupations over the course of millennia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the last two decades, scientific research has explored the problematic use of internet, videogames and mobile phones. However, there is still little consistent knowledge regarding the co-occurrence of problematic technology use and the role of maladaptive personality characteristics in adolescence. The present study aimed to investigate adolescents' styles of technology use with a cluster analysis approach focusing on personality functioning. The sample comprised 408 Italian adolescents (46.3% males) aged 11 to 18 years (Mage = 13.80; SD = 2.08). Data were collected using the Internet Addiction Test, the Videogame Dependency Scale, the Test of Mobile-Phone Dependence Brief Form and the Personality Inventory for DSM5 Brief Form. Results provided a four-cluster solution based on the co-occurrence of problematic technology use. The four clusters were labeled as follows: cluster 1: “Above average internet and mobile-phone use”; cluster 2: “Below average technology use”; cluster 3: “Above average videogame use”; and cluster 4: “Problematic technology use.” Analyses on demographic variables (e.g., gender and age) demonstrated significant differences between the four groups. Adolescents with high levels of problematic technology use reported greater overall personality dysfunction than the other three groups. This finding supported our hypothesis on maladaptive personality functioning in adolescents at risk for addiction. Finally, the Antagonism domain played a specific role in differentiating the severity of adolescents' involvement in technology use. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to plan preventive interventions as well as therapeutic treatments. © 2020 Scandinavian Psychological Associations and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

The current study explored the longitudinal associations of adolescents’ use of sexualized video games (SVG) and sexualized Instagram images (SII) with body image concerns. Specifically, our study examined relations between adolescents’ SVG and SII use and appearance comparisons, thin- and muscular-ideal internalization, valuing appearance over competence, and body surveillance. A sample of 660 German adolescents (327 female, 333 male; Mage = 15.09 years) participated in two waves with an interval of 6 months. A structural equation model showed that SVG and SII use at Time 1 predicted body surveillance indirectly via valuing appearance over competence at Time 2. Furthermore, SVG and SII use indirectly predicted both thin- and muscular-ideal internalization through appearance comparisons at Time 1. In turn, thin-ideal internalization at Time 1 predicted body surveillance indirectly via valuing appearance over competence at Time 2. The results indicate that sexualization in video games and on Instagram can play an important role in increasing body image concerns among adolescents. We discuss the findings with respect to objectification theory and the predictive value of including appearance comparisons in models explaining the relation between sexualized media and self-objectification. © 2020, The Author(s).},

This is a protocol paper that describes an innovative study design in which we rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of a tablet-assisted intervention, Supporting Providers and Reaching Kids (SPARK). SPARK consists of a collection of interactive games and activities that are designed to improve provider fidelity and child engagement in evidence-based psychotherapies. The methodology also allows us to explore the implementation and sustainability of a technology-enhanced intervention in more than two dozen community practice settings. This paper includes a description and justification for sample selection and recruitment procedures, selection of assessment measures and methods, design of the intervention, and statistical evaluation of critical outcomes. Novel features of the design include the tablet-based toolkit approach that has strong applicability to a range of child mental health interventions and the use of a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial that allows for the simultaneous investigation of the effectiveness of the intervention and the implementation context. Challenges related to the implementation of a technology-enhanced intervention in existing mental health clinics are discussed, as well as implications for future research and practice. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Quality sleep is critical for teenagers' physical and mental health and, consequently, learning achievement. Technology, particularly the use of mobile sensors and digital game-based learning, has the potential to enhance students' sleep hygiene, reducing insomnia and daytime sleepiness and improving students’ academic performance. Therefore, this study implemented and evaluated a sleep hygiene instruction intervention in terms of three elements: a) mobile sleep sensor data feedback for sleep self-evaluation; b) a collaborative-competitive mobile community game (MCG) for sleep promotion based on social-interdependence; and c) an instructional intervention adopting a social cognitive approach. To validate the efficacy of the instructional design, a pretest-posttest quasi-experiment was conducted with 114 10th grade students from three classes of an urban vocational high school in Taiwan. The three intact classes were randomly assigned to one of three sleep hygiene courses: a comparison group (37 students receiving sleep sensor feedback), experimental group one (E1; 38 students receiving sleep sensor feedback and adopting MCG), and experimental group two (E2; 39 students receiving sleep sensor feedback, adopting MCG, and taking a social cognitive-based course). The empirical results suggest that the use of sleep sensor feedback and the MCG (E1 and E2) effectively improved the sleep behaviors of vocational students. In fact, inclusion of the mobile sensor with feedback on sleep quality was sufficient to provide improvement in both sleep and academic outcomes for all students. These results demonstrate the promising potential of mobile community-based technological interventions for improving sleep hygiene, relieving insomnia daytime sleepiness, when integrated with either traditional or social cognitive-based sleep courses. Specific implications and recommendations for the development of technology-enhanced sleep-related or health promotion courses are provided. © 2020},

	abstract = {In this paper, we describe an intervention implemented to assist a 13.2-year-old boy with Autism Spectrum Disorder, G, without intellectual disability, aimed at improving his ability to compose persuasive texts. There was an initial assessment (baseline), an intermediate assessment after two weeks, a six-session intervention phase, and a post-intervention assessment. Our intervention applied two procedures. The first aimed at enhancing general composition abilities in terms of picking (P) ideas, organizing (O) notes, and writing (W) them down (POW), while the second specified the steps to write a persuasive text addressing a possible reader: a topic sentence (T), reasons (R), an explanation (E) for the reasons and the end of the sentence (E) (TREE). These procedures were termed POW + TREE. To analyze G’s texts, three types of measures were used by two raters at baseline, intermediate and post-test time: a) the presence of the TREE components; b) the quality of the reasons and explanations for the reasons; c) the number of mental state terms. All these measures showed relevant quantitative improvements, as well as qualitative changes. In addition, when G’s performance at the end of the intervention was compared to that of typically developing controls, no statistical difference appeared. The results are discussed in light of the potentialities offered by the type of intervention described here. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background: Online dating apps are popular platforms for seeking romance and sexual relationships among young adults. As mobile apps can easily gain access to a pool of strangers (“new friends”) at any time and place, it leads to heightened sexual health risks and privacy concerns. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-led web-based intervention for online dating apps to prepare Chinese college students so that they have better self-efficacy when using dating apps. Methods: An open clustered randomized controlled trial was conducted among students from three colleges (The University of Hong Kong, Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, and Yijin Programme of Vocational Training College) in Hong Kong. Students aged 17 to 27 years who attended common core curriculum or general education were randomized into intervention and control groups. The intervention material, developed with high peer engagement, included four short videos, an interactive scenario game, and a risk assessment tool. An existing website promoting physical activities and healthy living was used as a control. Using the information, motivation, and behavioral skills (IMB) approach to design the evaluation, questionnaires covering participants’ sociodemographics and dating app characteristics, as well as the general self-efficacy scale (GSE) as the primary outcome and the risk propensity scale (RPS) as the secondary outcome were administered before, immediately after, and at 1 month after the intervention. Intention-to-treat analysis was adopted, and between-group differences were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test. A post-hoc multiple linear regression model was used to examine the correlates of the GSE and RPS. Results: A total of 578 eligible participants (290 in the intervention group and 288 in the control group) participated in the study with 36 lost to follow-up. There were more female participants (318/542, 58.7%) than male participants in the sample, reflecting the distribution of college students. Over half of the participants (286/542, 52.8%) reported the following reasons for using dating apps: being curious (170/498, 34.1%), trying to make new friends (158/498, 31.7%), and finding friends with similar interests (121/498, 24.3%). Overall, the participants in the intervention group reported favorable experiences when compared with the finding in the control group. There was significant improvement in the GSE score and reduction in the RPS score (P<.001) in the intervention group. University of Hong Kong students were more susceptible to risk reduction after the intervention when compared with students from the other two institutions. Conclusions: The online intervention was effective in improving general self-efficacy and reducing risk tendency among young students. Future work is needed to determine if this approach is cost-effective and such behavioral change is sustainable. ©William CW Wong, Wai Han Sun, Shu Ming Cheryl Chia, Joseph D Tucker, William PH Mak, Lin Song, Kitty Wai Ying Choi, Stephanie Tsz Hei Lau, Eric Yuk Fai Wan.},

The current research identifies a novel coping strategy to strengthen individuals' psychological resilience against the pandemic. Study 1 (N = 210) and Study 2 (N = 93) showed significant beneficial effect of representing oneself via avatar in social virtual world (SVW) on the psychological resilience towards contracting COVID-19. Study 2 also showed that this effect is explained by the disembodied (i.e., out-of-body) experience one encounters in the SVW by digitally representing oneself via an avatar), which enables SVW users to project themselves onto a character in a parallel world that is immune to the COVID-19 virus, thus alleviating the anxiety of contracting the virus themselves in the real world. Additionally, it ruled out alternate explanations like escapism and enjoyment. The findings extend the Proteus effect (i.e., individuals behaviorally conform with their avatar's visual/physical appearance) to a more innate feature of the avatar–its imperviousness from the human body's limitations. The results have important implications for health policy makers along with making a strong case for marketing computer-simulated games like SVWs as virtual therapy tools. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Current challenges in early identification of autism spectrum disorder lead to significant delays in starting interventions, thereby compromising outcomes. Digital tools can potentially address this barrier as they are accessible, can measure autism-relevant phenotypes and can be administered in children’s natural environments by non-specialists. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify and characterise potentially scalable digital tools for direct assessment of autism spectrum disorder risk in early childhood. In total, 51,953 titles, 6884 abstracts and 567 full-text articles from four databases were screened using predefined criteria. Of these, 38 met inclusion criteria. Tasks are presented on both portable and non-portable technologies, typically by researchers in laboratory or clinic settings. Gamified tasks, virtual-reality platforms and automated analysis of video or audio recordings of children’s behaviours and speech are used to assess autism spectrum disorder risk. Tasks tapping social communication/interaction and motor domains most reliably discriminate between autism spectrum disorder and typically developing groups. Digital tools employing objective data collection and analysis methods hold immense potential for early identification of autism spectrum disorder risk. Next steps should be to further validate these tools, evaluate their generalisability outside laboratory or clinic settings, and standardise derived measures across tasks. Furthermore, stakeholders from underserved communities should be involved in the research and development process. Lay abstract: The challenge of finding autistic children, and finding them early enough to make a difference for them and their families, becomes all the greater in parts of the world where human and material resources are in short supply. Poverty of resources delays interventions, translating into a poverty of outcomes. Digital tools carry potential to lessen this delay because they can be administered by non-specialists in children’s homes, schools or other everyday environments, they can measure a wide range of autistic behaviours objectively and they can automate analysis without requiring an expert in computers or statistics. This literature review aimed to identify and describe digital tools for screening children who may be at risk for autism. These tools are predominantly at the ‘proof-of-concept’ stage. Both portable (laptops, mobile phones, smart toys) and fixed (desktop computers, virtual-reality platforms) technologies are used to present computerised games, or to record children’s behaviours or speech. Computerised analysis of children’s interactions with these technologies differentiates children with and without autism, with promising results. Tasks assessing social responses and hand and body movements are the most reliable in distinguishing autistic from typically developing children. Such digital tools hold immense potential for early identification of autism spectrum disorder risk at a large scale. Next steps should be to further validate these tools and to evaluate their applicability in a variety of settings. Crucially, stakeholders from underserved communities globally must be involved in this research, lest it fail to capture the issues that these stakeholders are facing. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Mobile fitness applications are innovating the ways in which smartphone users self-manage their health. Prior research found that app functions may impact app efficacy. However, research to date has not sought to systematically investigate how different combinations of app functions impact user response to apps, especially adoption intent. This article describes two studies on mobile fitness app characteristics and user attitudes. Study One used content analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis on 98 iPhone fitness apps and identified four app clusters: “Tutor”, “Recorder”, “Game Companion”, and “Cheerleader.” Tracking was the predominant function in current market, but tracking-focused Recorder apps received lowest user ratings among all app clusters. Users favored Tutor apps that combine exercise education and tracking, and Game Companion apps that combine gamification, tracking, and social functions. Function combinations, rather than standalone functions, impact app success. Following a Reasoned Action Approach, Study Two found various effects of individual differences (age, gender, BMI, eHealth literacy, smartphone experience, function preference) on user attitude toward different fitness app types. A comparison between two studies demonstrated a mismatch between market offerings and user needs regarding app functions. Implications of results for mobile fitness app design to improve consumer health and for theories are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: There are no standard diagnostic criteria or interventions for internet gaming addiction (IGA) even though IGA is one of the most pervasive public health issues among youth worldwide. Internet gaming reasons or motivations have been studied as a potential predictor of IGA, but the results have been inconsistent and biological indicators of gaming reasons have rarely been studied. We sought to (1) identify categories of internet gaming reasons, (2) examine the relationship of gaming reasons to risk of IGA, and (3) describe biological indicators associated with reasons for gaming. Methods: We used a multi-phase cross-sectional design including individual interviews; focus group discussion; and descriptive, comparative analysis. Fifteen Korean adolescent male internet gamers participated in individual interviews and eight participated in a focus group aimed at identifying reasons for internet gaming. Using the identified gaming reasons from these sources we surveyed 225 adolescent game users using a self-report questionnaire. Participants provided blood samples for assessment of norepinephrine (NE) and serum cortisol. Results: We identified four major categories of internet gaming reasons: entertainment, getting along with friends, stress relief, and habitual gaming. The habitual group showed significantly greater risk of IGA than the other groups (p <.001) and the lowest plasma NE levels (p =.035), possibly indicating an alteration in autonomic function. Conclusion: Health care providers are encouraged to screen adolescents for excessive internet gaming and to intervene with those who report habitual gaming behaviors. When feasible, assessment of biological indicators, such as plasma NE, may help to identify youth at greatest risk of IGA.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Access to affordable, objective and scalable biomarkers of brain function is needed to transform the healthcare burden of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, both resting and in combination with targeted cognitive tasks, have demonstrated utility in tracking disease state and therapy response in a range of conditions from schizophrenia to Alzheimer's disease. But conventional methods of recording this data involve burdensome clinic visits, and behavioural tasks that are not effective in frequent repeated use. This paper aims to evaluate the technical and human-factors feasibility of gathering large-scale EEG using novel technology in the home environment with healthy adult users. In a large field study, 89 healthy adults aged 40–79 years volunteered to use the system at home for 12 weeks, 5 times/week, for 30 min/session. A 16-channel, dry-sensor, portable wireless headset recorded EEG while users played gamified cognitive and passive tasks through a tablet application, including tests of decision making, executive function and memory. Data was uploaded to cloud servers and remotely monitored via web-based dashboards. Seventy-eight participants completed the study, and high levels of adherence were maintained throughout across all age groups, with mean compliance over the 12-week period of 82% (4.1 sessions per week). Reported ease of use was also high with mean System Usability Scale scores of 78.7. Behavioural response measures (reaction time and accuracy) and EEG components elicited by gamified stimuli (P300, ERN, Pe and changes in power spectral density) were extracted from the data collected in home, across a wide range of ages, including older adult participants. Findings replicated well-known patterns of age-related change and demonstrated the feasibility of using low-burden, large-scale, longitudinal EEG measurement in community-based cohorts. This technology enables clinically relevant data to be recorded outside the lab/clinic, from which metrics underlying cognitive ageing could be extracted, opening the door to potential new ways of developing digital cognitive biomarkers for disorders affecting the brain. © Copyright © 2021 McWilliams, Barbey, Dyer, Islam, McGuinness, Murphy, Nolan, Passmore, Rueda-Delgado and Buick.},

	abstract = {An estimated 350 million cases of STIs occur globally each year. In Sweden, Chlamydia is the most common STI with approximately 30 000 cases annually, disproportionally affecting youth. National surveys report low condom use among youth. Smartphone coverage is high among this tech-savvy group. In collaboration with youth, we developed an interactive smartphone application comprising games, peer experiences and information snippets to promote condom use. Objectives To evaluate in a randomised controlled trial, the effectiveness of this smartphone application to improve condom use among youth in Stockholm, Sweden. Methods This two-arm, individually randomised controlled trial was implemented through the Youth Health Clinics (YHC) in Stockholm, Sweden. Youth aged 18-23 years, who owned a smartphone and had ≥2 sexual partners during the past 6 months were eligible. The intervention delivered the interactive elements described above over 180 days. The control group received a â € dummy' application. Both groups received standard of care at the YHC. The primary outcome was proportion of consistent (100%) self-reported condom use at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included self-reported number of partners, occurrence of STIs/pregnancy and STI tests during the study period. An intention-to-treat approach was used. Results 214 and 219 youth were randomised to the intervention and control groups, respectively. Consistent condom use was reported for 32/214 (15.0%) in the intervention group and for 35/219 (16.0%) in the control group (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.6). No significant differences in secondary outcomes were seen. Conclusion We were unable to detect an effect of the intervention. Future research should focus on targeting different subgroups within the overall risk group, with tailored mHealth interventions. The potential for such interventions in settings where sexual health services are unavailable should be evaluated. © 2021 Author(s) (or their employer(s)). Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Online gambling is currently legal in many countries worldwide, and it is continuing to expand globally. In Spain, online gambling has been legal since 2012, when the government authorized companies to operate in this space. Many other countries have been through a similar process of legalization and the promotion of online gambling.

	abstract = {The presence of technologies in all areas and stages of life increases the risk of addiction to devices, networks, and the use of various programmes. Excessive use of devices and technologies during childhood and adolescence has negative effects on neurodevelopment and causes emotional disorders related to anxiety, stress, and depression. These disorders can be associated with the development of other addictions (alcohol, psychoactive substances) or other situations of risk of social exclusion such as bullying, among others. In our study of the risk of social exclusion in adolescents (ÁVALOS RUIZ, 2022) we have applied a complete diagnostic battery to 25 subjects of both sexes between 12 and 17 years of age focusing on six dimensions of risk: anxiety and depression, alcohol and other substance abuse, bullying, addiction to technologies, gender violence and risk behaviour in love and sexual relationships, and difficult family situation. The aim of this paper is to present and analyse the correlations found between each of the first three dimensions, and the technology addiction dimension as a predictor of other risk factors for social exclusion. The data show that addiction to video games, in particular, is related to high levels of depression, while addiction to any of the technologies studied (mobile, internet and video games) is significantly related to being a victim of bullying. © 2022 Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.

	abstract = {Background: Interventions targeting reduce screen time in adolescents are urgently needed, mainly in low and middle-income countries because of the lack of evidence. Thus, the aims of the study were to examine the effect of a cluster-randomized controlled trial on screen time (ST) devices among Brazilian adolescents and to identify possible moderators. Methods: Movimente was a multicomponent school-based intervention that was performed in 2017 and consisted of teacher training, education curriculum, and environmental improvements. Baseline and post-intervention assessments (over one academic year) were conducted with students aged 10–16 years at baseline (baseline n = 921, [n = 538 intervention group; n = 383 control group]). A self-report questionnaire was used to measure daily minutes of device specific screen time (TV, computer, video games and smartphone) and demographic variables. Linear mixed models were used to examine intervention effects and an exploratory moderation analysis (sex, grade and socioeconomic status) was performed. Results: The intervention had no significant effects on TV time (β = − 6.4, 95% CI: − 6.1;13.4), game time (β = − 8.2, 95% CI: − 7.2;10.8), computer time (β = 1.1, 95% CI: − 6.3;18.5), smartphone time (β = − 10.2, 95% CI: − 32.5;12.1), screen time (β = − 12.8, 95% CI: − 50.5;24.8), meeting screen time guidelines (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.65,2.57) and meeting screen time guidelines with smartphone (OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 0.37,7.40). There was a significant intervention effect on reducing TV time (β = − 37.1, 95% CI: − 73.0, − 1.3) among 8th grade students only. Conclusions: The Movimente intervention was effective only for TV time among 8th grade students. Understanding how school-based interventions can improve adolescents’ device specific screen time across age groups is needed. Future strategies should cover all screen-based devices. Further, there is a need for more studies in low- and-middle income countries to assist in the development of effective strategies.

	abstract = {Background: In the last decade, the use of technology-based sexual health education has increased. Multiple studies have shown the feasibility of technology-based interventions, while a subset has also shown efficacy in improving youths’ sexual health outcomes such as increased condom use and knowledge. However, little is known about health educators’ experiences in integrating technology to augment sexual health curricula. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the perceptions and experiences of health educators regarding the incorporation of technology into a sexual health education program designed for underserved youth in Fresno County, California, and to identify facilitators and challenges to incorporating technology into the in-person curriculum. Methods: This implementation study used data collected as part of a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate In the Know (ITK), an in-person sexual health education curriculum that includes technology-based content, such as a resource locator, videos, and games, which can be accessed through a mobile app or website. Data from implementation logs from each cohort (n=51) and annual interviews (n=8) with health educators were analyzed to assess the health educators’ experiences using the technology and adaptations made during the implementation. Results: The health educators reported that technological issues affected implementation to some degree: 87% of the time in the first year, which decreased to 47% in the third year as health educators’ familiarity with the app increased and functionality improved. Technology issues were also more common in non–school settings. Successes and challenges in 3 domains emerged: managing technology, usability of the ITK app, and youth engagement. The health educators generally had positive comments about the app and youth engagement with the technology-based content and activities; however, they also noted certain barriers to adolescents’ use of the mobile app including limited data storage and battery life on mobile phones. Conclusions: Health educators require training and support to optimize technology as a resource for engaging with youth and providing sensitive information. Although technology is often presented as a solution to reach underserved populations, educational programs should consider the technological needs and limitations of the participants, educators, and settings. © Martha J Decker, Salish Harrison, Melisa Price, Abigail Gutmann-Gonzalez, Jennifer Yarger, Rachel Tenney.},

	abstract = {Previous research claimed that integration of augmented reality on educational settings helps to improve academic achievement of students in collaborative learning environments, as well as to improve their retention and ability to translate this within other environments. Since augmented reality is still considered relatively novel technology in educational fields, there is an inherent need for research-based guides to design effective and feasible augmented reality tools for school-based learning. The main aim of this study was therefore to design and develop an augmented reality learning toolkit to foster spatial ability in middle school students using mobile devices. The study was conducted in two parts, as preliminary research and a prototyping phase. The findings guided the characteristics for designing an augmented reality learning toolkit with a set of spatial tasks aimed at middle school students. In light of the results, it can be inferred that the students were able to use this designed toolkit to perform their spatial ability through given spatial tasks since the students encountered no technical difficulties with the final toolkit prototype, and that they were able to use the toolkit assuredly. In conclusion, the study showed that augmented reality seemed helpful in enhancing the usage of mobile devices, not just for the reading of books, communication or playing games, but also as a support mechanism for the learning of mathematics. Thus, the augmented reality toolkit developed in this study presents a new way for students and/or teachers to use mobile devices in the learning and teaching of mathematics. © 2021, Bastas.

	abstract = {In the last few years, several computerized tasks have been developed to increase the objectivity of the diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This article proposes the “running raccoon” video game to assess the severity of inattention in patients diagnosed with ADHD. Unlike existing tests, the proposed tool is a genuine video game in which the patient must make a raccoon avatar jump to avoid falling into different gaps. The distance to the gap is recorded for each jump. To evaluate the proposed game, an experiment was conducted in which 32 children diagnosed with ADHD participated. For each participant, the median and interquartile range of these distances were calculated, along with the number of omissions. Experimental results showed a significant correlation between the participants’ inattention (measured by the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms and Normal Behavior rating scale (SWAN) inattention subscale) with each of these three measures. In addition to its accuracy, other benefits are its short duration and the possibility of being run on both standard computers and mobile devices.

	abstract = {Background: Early adolescent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection prevention are significant public health challenges in the United States. Parental influence can help adolescents make responsible and informed sexual health decisions toward delayed sexual debut; yet parents often feel ill equipped to communicate about sex-related topics. Intergenerational games offer a potential strategy to provide life skills training to young adolescents (aged 11-14 years) while engaging them and their parents in communication about sexual health. Objective: This study aims to describe the development of a web-based online sexual health intergenerational adventure game, the Secret of Seven Stones (SSS), using an intervention mapping (IM) approach for developing theory- and evidence-based interventions. Methods: We followed the IM development steps to describe a theoretical and empirical model for young adolescent sexual health behavior, define target behaviors and change objectives, identify theory-based methods and practical applications to inform design and function, develop and test a prototype of 2 game levels to assess feasibility before developing the complete 18-level game, draft an implementation plan that includes a commercial dissemination strategy, and draft an evaluation plan including a study design for a randomized controlled trial efficacy trial of SSS. Results: SSS comprised an adventure game for young adolescent skills training delivered via a desktop computer, a text-based notification system to provide progress updates for parents and cues to initiate dialogue with their 11- to 14-year-old child, and a website for parent skills training and progress monitoring. Formative prototype testing demonstrated feasibility for in-home use and positive usability ratings. Conclusions: The SSS intergenerational game provides a unique addition to the limited cadre of home-based programs that facilitate parent involvement in influencing young adolescent behaviors and reducing adolescent sexual risk taking. The IM framework provided a logical and thorough approach to development and testing, attentive to the need for theoretical and empirical foundations in serious games for health. © Ross Shegog, Laura Armistead, Christine Markham, Sara Dube, Hsing-Yi Song, Pooja Chaudhary, Angela Spencer, Melissa Peskin, Diane Santa Maria, J Michael Wilkerson, Robert Addy, Susan Tortolero Emery, Jeffery McLaughlin.

	abstract = {Three hypotheses have been suggested to explain factors underlying Internet gaming disorder symptoms (IGDs): the comorbidity hypothesis highlights the presence of further psychopathologies; the dilution effect hypothesis is associated with a low level of self-regulation; and the interpersonal impairment hypothesis focuses on the associations of social deficits. Anxiety and depression (comorbidity), impulsivity and hostility (self-regulation), social skills and family functioning (interpersonal impairment), and time spent gaming, both during the week and on the weekend, were assessed. Participants were 946 young people (51.5% males) aged from 11 to 18. Preliminary correlations indicated that higher scores in anxiety, impulsiveness, hostility, and social skills deficit and lower scores in family functioning and more time spent gaming were associated with IGDs. The proposed theoretical model had a good fit to the data, revealing that anxiety and time spent gaming on the weekend had a direct association with IGDs. Social skills and family functioning showed an indirect relationship with IGDs, whereas impulsivity only showed a direct association with time spent gaming during the week. However, a different set of variables was associated with IGDs depending on the gender. In girls, the significant variables associated with IGDs were time spent playing video games during the week and on the weekend, higher anxiety, and lower family functioning. In boys, direct associations between higher anxiety and hostility, social skill deficits, and time spent gaming on the weekend were found. Results support the three hypotheses, but their applicability varied according to gender. The comorbidity hypothesis was slightly superior for girls, whereas the dilution effect hypothesis was superior for boys. The factors involved in IGDs should be taken into account when designing interventions to prevent symptoms and their consequences. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Research has shown an increased risk for Non-suicidal self-injurious (NSSI) behavior as well as Problematic Smartphone Use (PSU) and particularly in adolescence, a developmental period defined by multi-level changes and still poor self-control capacities associating with risk-taking behaviors. Objective: The current study was aimed to assess the pattern of mutual relations characterizing NSSI considering self-control, internalizing and externalizing problems, and investigating how PSU fits within the network since NSSI and PSU are here conceptualized as attempts at emotion regulation. Age and gender differences were also assessed. Method: Participants were Italian adolescents presenting NSSI behavior (N = 155; Mage = 14.68; SD = 1.647; Range = 11–18; 43.2%-females); the sample is based on community recruitment. A Network Analysis was performed to assess the organizational structure of NSSI; age and gender differences were assessed through multivariate rank tests further applying multiplicity control. Results: The emerged Network showed the centrality of low self-control and internalizing problems for NSSI. NSSI and PSU were associated through low self-control, and so were PSU and externalizing problems. Significant age differences were observed showing a decrease in NSSI as age increases (stat = −2.86; adj.p = .029). No gender differences have emerged. Conclusions: The current findings provide support for the consideration and investigation of PSU as regards NSSI behavior in adolescence. Moreover, these findings point to the relevance of prevention practices during this peculiar developmental period, particularly sustaining self-control capacities and the use of more adaptive emotion regulation strategies, thereby limiting the accrue of at-risk behaviors. © 2021},

The research model is tested with a scenario-based survey method. Players' perceived threat refers to the negative consequences (eg, reduced performance or social isolation) that are caused by problematic smartphone game use. The findings indicate that under high fear appeals, threat appraisal creates fearful emotions about suffering from the negative consequences, which further reduces the gaming habit and activates the intention to decrease use. Self-efficacy in decreasing game playing, the response efficacy of decreasing usage in avoiding the threat and subjective norms effectively promote users' intention to decrease use. Moreover, response costs reduce the intention to decrease use. The findings provide insights into how to activate users' intention to decrease problematic use, and the resulting implications are discussed. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

These activities include both game play and game design. Research about gaming activities for increasing girls’ interest in computer science has gained much attention over the past few years and has resulted in a number of contributions. We follow up with an overview of the status of research through a Systematic Literature Review. We investigate the relation between the various game playing or designing activities and their impact on girls’ perception of Computer Science as a career choice. We further present the design consideration for the games and related activities to potentially improve the perception of girls towards a Computer Science career. The applied method is a Systematic Literature Review through which we investigate which contributions were made, which knowledge areas were most explored, and which research facets have been used. We identify 25 papers to distill a common understanding of the state-of-the-art. Specifically, we investigate the effects that the game play/design activities had on girls’ perception about Computer Science; and what are the key design factors to be kept in mind while designing a serious game to improve girls’ perception about Computer Science. The results of this systematic literature review show that game playing or designing could indeed improve how girls perceive having a career in CS. The key aspects that such activities require are personalizing, opportunity for collaboration and the presence of a female lead character. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Background: Studies have shown a high prevalence of depression during pregnancy, and there is also evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective psychosocial interventions. Emerging evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has shown that technology has been successfully harnessed to provide CBT interventions for other populations. However, very few studies have focused on their use during pregnancy. This approach has become increasingly important in many clinical areas due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our study aimed to expand the knowledge in this particular clinical area. Objective: Our systematic review aimed to bring together the available research-based evidence on digitalized CBT interventions for depression symptoms during pregnancy. Methods: A systematic review of the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EBSCO Open Dissertations databases was carried out from the earliest available evidence to October 27, 2021. Only RCT studies published in English were considered. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines were followed, and the protocol was registered on the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. The risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Results: The review identified 7 studies from 5 countries (the United States, China, Australia, Norway, and Sweden) published from 2015 to 2021. The sample sizes ranged from 25 to 1342 participants. The interventions used various technological elements, including text, images, videos, games, interactive features, and peer group discussions. They comprised 2 guided and 5 unguided approaches. Using digitalized CBT interventions for depression during pregnancy showed promising efficacy, with guided intervention showing higher effect sizes (Hedges g=1.21) than the unguided interventions (Hedges g=0.14-0.99). The acceptability of the digitalized CBT interventions was highly encouraging, based on user feedback. Attrition rates were low for the guided intervention (4.5%) but high for the unguided interventions (22.1%-46.5%). A high overall risk of bias was present for 6 of the 7 studies. Conclusions: Our search only identified a small number of digitalized CBT interventions for pregnant women, despite the potential of this approach. These showed promising evidence when it came to efficacy and positive outcomes for depression symptoms, and user feedback was positive. However, the overall risk of bias suggests that the efficacy of the interventions needs to be interpreted with caution. Future studies need to consider how to mitigate these sources of biases. Digitalized CBT interventions can provide prompt, effective, evidence-based interventions for pregnant women. This review increases our understanding of the importance of digitalized interventions during pregnancy, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

	abstract = {Mobile applications represent useful instruments to convey information and engage the users even during traveling, thanks to the wide diffusion of smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and similar devices. As such, they have high potential as learning tools that can act complementary to traditional teaching approaches. In the field of pharmacology, mobile applications are increasingly being used to improve adherence of patients or to help them report suspect adverse drug reactions. However, they have been scarcely applied to pharmacology education. In this article, we present PharmacoloGenius, a free Android mobile application integrating resources useful for students as well as healthcare professionals or researchers to expand knowledge on pharmacological topics. We gave particular emphasis to pharmacogenetics, as it is a fundamental tool to achieve personalized treatment. The application offers original games such as pharmacological trivia based on textbooks or special “journal club” trivia based on research articles conveying the state of the art on specific topics. Additionally, the app offers a curated list of online resources to study pharmacology and pharmacogenetics (e.g., free online courses, videos, and databases) as well as updated news on conferences, grants, and opportunities for pharmacologists. In conclusion, PharmacoloGenius aims to be a useful instrument for people interested in expanding their knowledge on pharmacology in an engaging way. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, LLC.},

The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of these three elements in the construction of the Brand Equity of a series, specifically in the case of Game of Thrones. Methodology. Through a questionnaire supplied to a sample of 240 subjects, analyzes are carried out by means of structural equations through LISREL, in order to determine the existence of relationships between attitude toward sex, violence and stereotypes and the formation of Brand Equity. Results. The results confirm the existence of a direct and positive relationship between attitudes towards violence, sex and stereotypes and the formation of Brand Equity. Conclusions. This research increases the literature related to Brand Equity, in a novel sector such as television series, confirming the importance of sex, violence and stereotypes when building Brand Equity. Implications: This study can serve as a tool for the producers of television series, in general, and of Game of Thrones, in particular, since they should balance the presence of these contents in their creations since they can affect the evaluation by the spectators, affecting their Brand Equity. © 2019 Cuadernos de Gestión.; Marco teórico.

	abstract = {Technology can enhance the health and quality of life of diverse populations and may play an important role in reducing health disparities. Although a 'digital divide' between the young and the old has been noted, it is unclear whether the use of technology for managing health differs by race/ethnicity among older adults. This study uses nationally representative data from community-dwelling older Americans to characterize racial/ethnic differences in health-related technology use. Data came from 1,336 white, black, and Hispanic adults aged 54 and older who completed the 2014 technology module of the Health and Retirement Study. Racial/ethnic differences in overall health-related technology use were assessed using Poisson regression. Then, F-tests were used to assess differences in the use of phone calls, text messages, E-mails, social media, health management sites, health-related mobile applications, web searches, and brain games for health purposes. Compared to whites, older blacks and Hispanics were less likely to use technology for health-related purposes after accounting for demographic characteristics, education, and health conditions. They were also less likely to make or receive phone calls, use health management sites, search the web for health information, and use brain games for their health. Older racial and ethnic minorities are less likely than whites to use certain technologies when managing their health. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the patterns of health-related technology use across racially and ethnically diverse populations to appropriately tailor interventions aimed at improving minority health and eliminating health disparities. © The Author(s) 2018.

	abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Adequate use of this equipment is more critical than ever because the risk of shortages must be balanced against the need to effectively protect health care workers, including prehospital personnel. Specific training is therefore necessary; however, the need for social distancing has markedly disrupted the delivery of continuing education courses. Electronic learning (e-learning) may provide significant advantages because it requires neither the physical presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. Objective: Inclusion of game mechanics, or “gamification,” has been shown to increase knowledge and skill acquisition. The objective of this research was to develop a gamified e-learning module to interactively deliver concepts and information regarding the correct choice and handling of PPE. Methods: The SERES framework was used to define and describe the development process, including scientific and design foundations. After we defined the target audience and learning objectives by interviewing the stakeholders, we searched the scientific literature to establish relevant theoretical bases. The learning contents were validated by infection control and prehospital experts. Learning mechanics were then determined according to the learning objectives, and the content that could benefit from the inclusion of game mechanics was identified. Results: The literature search resulted in the selection and inclusion of 12 articles. In addition to gamification, pretesting, feedback, avoiding content skipping, and demonstrations using embedded videos were used as learning mechanics. Gamification was used to enhance the interactivity of the PPE donning and doffing sequences, which presented the greatest learning challenges. The module was developed with Articulate Storyline 3 to ensure that it would be compatible with a wide array of devices, as this software generates HTML5-compatible output that can be accessed on smartphones, tablets, and regular computers as long as a recent browser is available. Conclusions: A gamified e-learning module designed to promote better knowledge and understanding of PPE use among prehospital health care workers was created by following the SERES framework. The impact of this module should now be assessed by means of a randomized controlled trial. © 2020 JMIR Publications. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Use of herbal medicines is common. There is a need for education in this area. Mobile games are useful educational tools for motivating learning. A mobile game on herbal medicines can potentially enhance players’ herb-related knowledge. Our objective was to develop a mobile game to motivate players to learn more about herbal medicines. Methods: Game development comprised of storyboarding, user interface design, database development, server development and distribution. A pilot usability study was conducted for the game prototype. Data was gathered through user registration, background data collection and a post-game survey containing a quiz on herbs encountered in the game. Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used for data analysis. Results: “Herbopolis” is an in-house developed mobile game of the simulation genre. Players are tasked to manage a city specializing in the production and sale of herbal products. Nineteen out of 24 participants downloaded and played the game, and completed the post-game survey. Heuristic evaluations for usability, playability and educability were generally positive. Strong positive associations were observed between player level (r = 0.810, p < 0.001) and gameplay time (r = 0.757, p < 0.001) with quiz scores. Female players scored higher in the quiz (p =.044), played for more days (p =.010) and attained higher levels (p =.010) than male players. Conclusion: Players are motivated to learn about herb-related information through playing “Herbopolis”. Our results support its use for improving knowledge on herbal medicines. Future game iterations to improve robustness and performance will likely to improve its reception and effectiveness in learning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Young people aged 15 to 24 years account for one-third of new adult HIV infections. Controlling the HIV epidemic requires effective interventions targeted toward young people and their needs. Smartphone games offer a promising avenue for reaching this population with evidence-based HIV prevention interventions. It is crucial to the effectiveness of these interventions that they be acceptable and intrinsically motivating to adolescents as well as acceptable to their parents. Objective: Tumaini is a narrative-based smartphone game designed to help prevent HIV among young Africans aged 11 to 14 years by delaying first sex and increasing condom use at first sex. Following a 16-day feasibility study of Tumaini, we assessed the acceptability (1) of the intervention, where acceptability was operationalized as appeal, relevance, value, usability, and understandability, and (2) of this study and a planned future randomized controlled efficacy trial. Methods: During the randomized feasibility study (n=60) of Tumaini in western Kenya in spring 2017, 30 participants used the intervention on a study-provided smartphone. The app automatically logged participant interaction with the game in time-stamped log files. All 30 participants completed an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview–based game experience survey, and 27 took part in 4 focus group discussions (FGDs) about the game’s appeal, relevance, value, usability, and understandability. Their parents (n=22) also participated in 4 FGDs about the acceptability of the intervention, of this study, and of a planned efficacy trial. Survey data were analyzed using SAS software (SAS Institute Inc); FGD transcripts were coded and analyzed in MAXQDA 12 (Verbi GmbH); and gameplay log files were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Results: Adolescent participants’ survey responses indicated that Tumaini scored well with players on all indicators of acceptability (appeal, relevance, value, usability, and understandability). Focus group analyses aligned with these findings and emphasized a high degree of player engagement with the game, which was supported by log file analysis. Adolescent participants were eager for additional content, and parents were receptive to a longer study involving biomarkers, based on their positive experiences with this study. There is scope to improve communication with parents about their role in the intervention. As the game was tested in beta version, there is also scope to fine-tune some of the game mechanics to increase usability. Conclusions: This study shows the strong acceptability of an interactive smartphone-based game both to adolescents and their parents in western Kenya and that of the study methods used to pilot-test the intervention. It also suggests that longitudinal efficacy studies of this type of intervention, including those using biomarkers, have the potential to be acceptable among parents.

	abstract = {Background: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth and other young people diverse in terms of their sexuality and gender (LGBT+) are at an elevated risk of mental health problems such as depression. Factors such as isolation and stigma mean that accessing mental health services can be particularly challenging for LGBT+ young people, and previous studies have highlighted that many prefer to access psychological support on the Web. Research from New Zealand has demonstrated promising effectiveness and acceptability for an LGBT+ focused, serious game-based, computerized cognitive behavioral therapy program, Rainbow Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, X-factor thoughts (SPARX). However, there has been limited research conducted in the area of electronic therapy (e-therapy) for LGBT+ people. Objective: This study aimed to explore how and why LGBT+ young people use the internet to support their mental health. This study also sought to explore LGBT+ young people's and professionals' views about e-therapies, drawing on the example of Rainbow SPARX. Methods: A total of 3 focus groups and 5 semistructured interviews were conducted with 21 LGBT+ young people (aged 15-22 years) and 6 professionals (4 health and social care practitioners and 2 National Health Service commissioners) in England and Wales. A general inductive approach was used to analyze data. Results: LGBT+ youth participants considered that the use of the internet was ubiquitous, and it was valuable for support and information. However, they also thought that internet use could be problematic, and they highlighted certain internet safety and personal security considerations. They drew on a range of gaming experiences and expectations to inform their feedback about Rainbow SPARX. Their responses focused on the need for this e-therapy program to be updated and refined. LGBT+ young people experienced challenges related to stigma and mistreatment, and they suggested that strategies addressing their common challenges should be included in e-therapy content. Professional study participants also emphasized the need to update and refine Rainbow SPARX. Moreover, professionals highlighted some of the issues associated with e-therapies needing to demonstrate effectiveness and challenges associated with health service commissioning processes. Conclusions: LGBT+ young people use the internet to obtain support and access information, including information related to their mental health. They are interested in LGBT-specific e-therapies; however, these must be in a contemporary format, engaging, and adequately acknowledge the experiences of LGBT+ young people. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.

	abstract = {There are few stressful factors which have been investigated to affect adrenocortical function in the African wild dog (AWD) Lycaon pictus. Understanding what animals perceive as stressors is important for not only the implementation of management practices promoting general animal welfare in captivity, but also because a prolonged stress perception is known to disrupt reproduction, immune function and ultimately pose a threat to survival. In this regard, faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) measurements are commonly used as a non-invasive approach to assess the impact of factors which may be acting as perceived stressors in wildlife. This study was aimed at determining if there are significant differences in AWD fGCM concentrations as a result of sex, presence of absence of an injury, age-class, body condition, dietary provisioning (through stable nitrogen (Í15N) and carbon (Í13C) isotope analysis), hierarchal status, and setting (i.e. captive or free-ranging). A total of 47 faecal samples were collected immediately post-defaecation from 39 AWDs across four free-ranging sites (Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, Madikwe Game Reserve, Kruger National Park and the Waterberg), two permanently captive sites (Johannesburg and Pretoria Zoo), and four temporary captive holding facilities (Hoedspruit Endangered Species Centre and Maremani, Tembe and Zimanga bomas) in South Africa. Captive AWDs had distinctively higher fGCM levels than their free-ranging counterparts, regardless of sex, body condition, hierarchal status, age-class or dietary provisioning. The present study is the first to assess physiological stress responses across permanently captive, temporarily captive and free-ranging AWDs within the South African managed metapopulation, while incorporating the use of stable isotope analysis to quantify differences in dietary isotopic profiles between these different settings. Ultimately this demonstrates the usefulness of fGCM analysis as a tool for assessing animal welfare in both captive and free-ranging AWDs, and underpins the importance of understanding factors perceived as stressors for the management of the species.

	abstract = {Dissociating meat from its animal origins has been considered a central strategy omnivores employ to sustain their meat consumption despite their concerns for animal welfare. In recent years, the dissociation strategy has become increasingly contested as short food-chain movements promote consumer contact with farmed animals as a means to more ethical eating. This article examines how different groups of Finnish consumers construct the meat–animal link based on focus groups with gastronomes, hunters, organic consumers, rural women, and supermarket customers. The theoretical approach is based on Noëlie Vialles’s concepts of the sarcophage and zoophage logic of meat eating and on the literature on animal categorization. Supermarket customers preferred to dissociate meat from the animal, while gastronomes and rural residents regarded the presence of the animal in meat as important for its quality. Hunters valued game meat highly as animals were transformed into meat through their own effort. Although rural women and some organic consumers personalized certain farmed animals due to their proximity, these animals were still edible and killable. The research suggests that challenging dissociation does not in itself necessarily imply an increased moral valuation of animals if the objectification of animals is not confronted. © 2018 Association for the Study of Food and Society.},

	abstract = {Background: Opportunities in digital distribution place mobile games as a promising platform for games for health. However, designing a game that can compete in the saturated mobile games market and deliver persuasive health messages can feel like an insurmountable challenge. Although user-centered design is widely advocated, factors such as the user's subject domain expertise, budget constraints, and poor data collection methods can restrict the benefits of user involvement. Objective: This study aimed to develop a playable and acceptable game for health, targeted at young key populations in the Philippines. Methods: Authors identified a range of user-centered design methods to be used in tandem from published literature. The resulting design process involved a phased approach, with 40 primary and secondary users engaged during the initial ideation and prototype testing stages. Selected methods included participatory design workshops, playtests, playability heuristics, and focus group discussions. Subject domain experts were allocated roles in the development team. Data were analyzed using a framework approach. Conceptual frameworks in health intervention acceptability and game design guided the analysis. In-game events were captured through the Unity Analytics service to monitor uptake and game use over a 12-month period. Results: Early user involvement revealed a strong desire for online multiplayer gameplay, yet most reported that access to this type of game was restricted because of technical and economic constraints. A role-playing game (RPG) with combat elements was identified as a very appealing gameplay style. Findings guided us to a game that could be played offline and that blended RPG elements, such as narrative and turn-based combat, with match-3 puzzles. Although the game received a positive response during playtests, gameplay was at times perceived as repetitive and predicted to only appeal to casual gamers. Knowledge transfer was predominantly achieved through interpretation of the game's narrative, highlighting this as an important design element. Uptake of the game was positive; between December 1, 2017, and December 1, 2018, 3325 unique device installs were reported globally. Game metrics provided evidence of adoption by young key populations in the Philippines. Game uptake and use were substantially higher in regions where direct engagement with target users took place. Conclusions: User-centered design activities supported the identification of important contextual requirements. Multiple data collection methods enabled triangulation of findings to mediate the inherent biases of the different techniques. Game acceptance is dependent on the ability of the development team to implement design solutions that address the needs and desires of target users. If target users are expected to develop design solutions, they must have adequate expertise and a significant role within the development team. Facilitating meaningful partnerships between health professionals, the games industry, and end users will support the games for health industry as it matures. © 2021 JMIR Cancer.

	abstract = {In this study we investigated the relationship between body movement during virtual reality (VR) analgesia and the experience of pain. Thermal (cold) stimulation was used to inflict pain. Two measures of pain were used—pain tolerance and pain intensity. Participants were wearing head mounted displays (Oculus Rift DK2) and were playing a game created by authors of the study. Forty-six students of Wroclaw University participated in a within-subject design experiment. Each subject participated in a non-VR control condition and in two experimental conditions. Participants navigated the VR game using a computer mouse, but the mouse sensitivity (and therefore amount of physical movement necessary to navigate) was different in each experimental condition. We also measured feeling of presence in VR, game behavior, and attitudes toward the game. The amount of body movement while steering the game was related to a decrease in pain intensity, but not in pain tolerance. This was an opposite result to our previously published experiment where we found an effect on pain tolerance but not on sensitivity. There was no significant correlation between presence and any of the pain measures. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The video-game industry has become a significant force in the business and entertainment world. Video games have become so widespread and pervasive that they are now considered a part of the mass media, a common method of storytelling and representation. Despite the massive popularity of video games, their increasing variety, and the diversification of the player base, until very recently little attention was devoted to understanding how playing video games affects the way people think and collaborate across cultures. This paper examines the recent literature regarding the impact of video games on players from an intercultural perspective. Sixty-two studies are identified whose aim is to analyze behavioral-change, content understanding, knowledge acquisition, and perceptional impacts. Their findings suggest that video games have the potential to help to acquire cultural knowledge and develop intercultural literacy, socio-cultural literacy, cultural awareness, self-awareness, and the cultural understanding of different geopolitical spaces, to reinforce or weaken stereotypes, and to some extent also facilitate the development of intercultural skills. The paper provides valuable insights to the scholars, teachers, and practitioners of cultural studies, education, social studies, as well as to the researchers, pointing out areas for future research. © 2020 JESTP.},

	abstract = {Though mother-to-child HIV transmission has been dramatically reduced in the past decade, there are currently an estimated 1.8 million children living with HIV across the globe, and over 30% of all new HIV infections occur among youth ages 15–25. While all youth experience developmental challenges, children and adolescents who are living with HIV must navigate these challenges within the context of high HIV stigma and must cope with a host of psychosocial and health-related challenges. In addition, because HIV disproportionately impacts individuals from minority statuses (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality) and people living in poverty, vulnerabilities are often compounded. Resilience frameworks emphasize the capacity for positive adaptation to adversity, and thus provide a useful lens to identify and build upon individual and community strengths. This article introduces a special issue of AIDS Care that examines factors associated with resilience among children and adolescents affected by or living with HIV, as well as innovative interventions designed to build resilience among HIV youth populations. The articles highlighted within this issue examine the possibility of building resilience across diverse settings (e.g., schools, communities, healthcare clinics) and with varied populations (e.g., youth living with HIV, AIDS orphans, young men who have sex with men). We also highlight innovative approaches to resilience-building, including a new mobile Health (mHealth) smartphone game that aims to improve adherence among youth living with HIV in the United States. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The present study focused on the potential risk and protective effects of user–avatar (game figure) relationship and physical activity (PA), respectively. To address these aims, a cross-sectional and a longitudinal mixed-methods design were combined (comprising both psychological and physiological assessments). A sample of 121 emerging adult gamers (18–29 years) residing in Australia, who played massively multiplayer online games, were assessed in relation to their IGD behaviours using the nine-item Internet Gaming Disorder Scale–Short Form. Additionally, the Proto-Self-Presence (PSP) scale was used to evaluate the extent to which gamers identified with the body of their avatar. Finally, a PA monitor (Fitbit Flex) measured levels of energy consumed during real-world daily activities (active minutes). A number of linear regressions and moderation analyses were conducted. Findings confirmed that PSP functioned as an IGD risk factor and that PA acted protectively, weakening the association between PSP and IGD behaviours. Implications of these findings are discussed in relation to IGD treatment and gaming development aspects. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Method: A descriptive study conducted with 100 caregivers, 9 teachers and 100 people with Intellectual Disability from a Philanthropic Institution in Campina Grande, Paraiba, Brazil. The participants ages in the study ranged from 9 to 83 years. Three-hundred (300) questionnaires were administered. The data were processed by Factorial Matching Analysis in the Tri-Deux-Mots program. Results: Considering the factorial correspondence plan, it should be noted that the social skills of students in the age group between 21 and 40 years were related to playing educational games, playing ball with friends and dating. Regarding conceptual skills, students revealed autonomy in relation to school activities, however the caregivers emphasized that they lack autonomy in relation to these skills. In perceiving the realities of students from different classes, teachers presented opposing opinions on dependency and independence issues. Conclusion: Education and health professionals and caregivers can collaborate more effectively in developing the autonomy of people with Intellectual Disability by promoting a more interactive environment which provides skills development and interpersonal relationships without discrimination, disrespect or prejudice. © 2019 Escola de Enfermagem de Universidade de Sao Paulo.},

	abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection globally. High-risk HPV types can cause cervical cancer, other anogenital cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer; low-risk HPV types can cause genital warts. Cervical cancer is highly preventable through HPV vaccination and screening; however, a lack of awareness and knowledge of HPV and these preventive strategies represents an important barrier to reducing the burden of the disease. The rapid development and widespread use of mobile technologies in the last few years present an opportunity to overcome this lack of knowledge and create new, effective, and modern health communication strategies. Objective: This study aimed to describe the development of a mobile app called FightHPV, a game-based learning tool that educates mobile technology users about HPV, the disease risks associated with HPV infection, and existing preventive methods. Methods: The first version of FightHPV was improved in a design-development-evaluation loop, which incorporated feedback from a beta testing study of 40 participants, a first focus group of 6 participants aged between 40 and 50 years and a second focus group of 23 participants aged between 16 and 18 years. Gameplay data from the beta testing study were collected using Google Analytics (Google), whereas feedback from focus groups was evaluated qualitatively. Of the 29 focus group participants, 26 returned self-administered questionnaires. HPV knowledge before and after playing the game was evaluated in the 22 participants from the second focus group who returned a questionnaire. Results: FightHPV communicates concepts about HPV, associated diseases and their prevention by representing relationships among 14 characters in 6 episodes of 10 levels each, with each level being represented by a puzzle. Main concepts were reinforced with text explanations. Beta testing revealed that many players either failed or had to retry several times before succeeding at the more difficult levels in the game. It also revealed that players gave up at around level 47 of 60, which prompted the redesign of FightHPV to increase accessibility to all episodes. Focus group discussions led to several improvements in the user experience and dissemination of health information in the game, such as making all episodes available from the beginning of the game and rewriting the information in a more appealing way. Among the 26 focus group participants who returned a questionnaire, all stated that FightHPV is an appealing educational tool, 69% (18/26) reported that they liked the game, and 81% (21/26) stated that the game was challenging. We observed an increase in HPV knowledge after playing the game (P=.001). Conclusions: FightHPV was easy to access, use, and it increased awareness about HPV infection, its consequences, and preventive measures. FightHPV can be used to educate people to take action against HPV and cervical cancer. © 2019 JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Even though chronic stress is a pervasive problem in contemporary societies and is known to potentially precede both adverse psychological as well as physiological conditions, its effects on decision making have not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we focus on the relation between self-reported chronic stress and self-reported as well as behaviorally shown social preferences. We measured chronic stress with the Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress. To determine social preferences, participants played a double anonymous dictator game. In order to control for the robustness of social preferences we employed a 2x2x2x2 design where we manipulated four variables: the frame (Give to Recipient vs. Take from Recipient), the decision maker’s gender (Female vs. Male), the recipient’s gender (Female vs. Male), and the nature of the reward (Real vs. Hypothetical). Results show that perceived chronic stress is not significantly related to social preferences in monetarily rewarded dictator decisions for either gender. However, women’s displayed preferences for hypothetical rewards are negatively correlated to chronic stress levels. This indicates that higher chronic stress in women is associated with lower hypothetical transfers but not with altered actual behavior as compared to non-stressed women. For men, we do not observe such effects. Our findings suggest that, while chronic stress leaves social preferences unaffected in an incentive compatible task, it might foster what could be interpreted as a decrease in self-image promotion in women. Thus, we conclude that in a thoroughly controlled behavioral task differences in reported chronic stress do not entail differences in social preferences, but relate to variation in hypothetical decisions for women. © 2018 Ceccato et al.

Findings: A total of 79 student pharmacists played the Mimycx quests. Only 66 students completed both pre- and post-quest questionnaires. Students indicated their familiarity with game concepts related to the virtual environment and avatars used in the study. The change in their attitudes and satisfaction about the Mimycx virtual learning experience was significant between the two learning time points. The use of virtual gaming technology could enhance student pharmacists’ learning and engagement in the classroom. Students benefitted from increased familiarity with virtual, educational gaming concepts in their experiences with Mimycx, although no statistically significant differences were found regarding their attitudes toward communication and teamwork. © 2018},

	abstract = {Although many studies have focused on the potential of implementing gamification in education, the existing literature remains inconclusive about its effectiveness. In order to make sense of the contradictory findings regarding the effectiveness of implementing game design elements in an online learning environment, this paper complements the available body of research by addressing three holes. We have (1) analysed gamification's underlying motivational processes from a Self-Determination Theory-perspective, thereby accounting for the motivational effects of various game design implementations; (2) empirically assessed subtle motivational changes over time, and (3) accounted for the potential individual differences in motivational effects of gamification. Over a period of 15 weeks, we administered four surveys to measure the possible evolution in students’ (N = 40) motivational levels in response to interacting with need-supporting game elements that were implemented in Google + Communities used in a university course. Participants’ autonomous and controlled motivation was curve linear, showing an initial downward trend that surprisingly shifted to an upward tendency towards the end of the semester. Their controlled motivation stayed stable throughout. The results illustrated the significance of the individual nature of motivational processes, the importance of sensitive longitudinal motivation measurements, and the relevance of the implemented game elements’ design characteristics. We end this article by opening the debate on using theoretical lenses when designing gamification, and by providing avenues for future research. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Different types of applications and the scope of their impacts on urban life are captured based on a life-oriented approach. Data were collected via an online survey of 1000 residents living in different cities of Japan in December 2017. It was found that 75.1% of respondents owned a smartphone and used 3.5 applications on average. Among the users of smartphone application(s), 45.4% experienced at least one life change. Applying a random forest approach, this study examined the relative influence of application usage on urban life as compared to built-environment, individual, and household attributes, as well as interdependencies across life changes, by building 37 forests with 37000 trees. It was revealed that applications of “game”, “photo, video”, “utility, tool, efficiency”, “shopping”, “healthcare, sports, beauty”, “touring”, “education”, “book, comic”, and “navigation, and map” induce changes in work, study, daily trip making, talks between family members, time use, sleeping, expenditure, physical exercise, and shopping in a complicated manner, even though the built environment attributes are the most important predictors to the life changes as a whole. © 2019},

	abstract = {Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death among 10- to 19-year-olds in the United States, with 5% to 8% attempting suicide each year. Suicide risk rises significantly during early adolescence and is higher in rural and underserved communities. School-based universal prevention programs offer a promising way of reducing suicide by providing strategies for emotion regulation and encouraging help-seeking behaviors and youth-adult connectedness. However, such programs frequently run into difficulties in trying to engage a broad range of students. Text messaging is a dominant medium of communication among youths, and studies show both efficacy and uptake in text messaging interventions aimed at adolescents. Text-based interventions may, thus, offer a means for school-based universal prevention programs to engage adolescents who would otherwise be difficult to reach. Objective: We field tested Text4Strength, an automated, interactive text messaging intervention that seeks to reach a broad range of early adolescents in rural communities. Text4Strength extends Sources of Strength, a peer-led school suicide prevention program, by encouraging emotion regulation, help-seeking behaviors, and youth-adult connectedness in adolescents. The study tested the appeal and feasibility of Text4Strength and its potential to extend universal school-based suicide prevention. Methods: We field tested Text4Strength with 42 ninth-grade students. Over 9 weeks, students received 28 interactive message sequences across 9 categories (Sources of Strength introduction, positive friend, mentors, family support, healthy activities, generosity, spirituality, medical access, and emotion regulation strategies). The message sequences included games, requests for advice, questions about students' own experiences, and peer testimonial videos. We measured baseline mental health characteristics, frequency of replies, completion of sequences and video viewing, appeal to students, and their perception of having benefited from the program. Results: Of the 42 participating students, 38 (91%) responded to at least one sequence and 22 (52%) responded to more than a third of the sequences. The proportion of students who completed multistep sequences they had started ranged from 35% (6/17) to 100% (3/3 to 28/28), with responses dropping off when more than 4 replies were needed. With the exception of spirituality and generosity, each of the content areas generated at least a moderate number of student replies from both boys and girls. Students with higher and lower levels of risk and distress interacted with the sequences at similar rates. Contrary to expectations, few students watched videos. Students viewed the intervention as useful-even those who rarely responded to messages. More than 70% found the texts useful (3 items, n range 29-34) and 90% (36) agreed the program should be repeated. Conclusions: Text4Strength offers a potentially engaging way to extend school-based interventions that promote protective factors for suicide. Text4Strength is ready to be revised, based on findings and student feedback from this field test, and rigorously tested for efficacy. © 2018 Anthony R Pisani, Peter A Wyman, Kunali Gurditta, Karen Schmeelk-Cone, Carolyn L Anderson, Emily Judd.},

	abstract = {Parental mediation of screen media (e.g., television, video games) is associated with better outcomes for children. Although much research has examined parental mediation of television (TV), there is a dearth of research examining communication about mobile media (e.g., Smartphones, tablets) in the digital age. This study seeks to identify themes of family communication around media and mobile devices using naturalistic observational methodology. The sample consisted of 21 toddlers (ages 12–24-months old), 31 preschool-age children (3–5 years old), and 23 school-age (10–13 years old) children and their families. Children wore Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) audio recording devices, which recorded vocalizations and other sounds proximal to the child wearing the device in the home environment, as well as audible screen media use. ATLAS.ti was used to transcribe dialogue from the audio recordings that pertained to screen media. Experts from the fields of communication, clinical child psychology, and developmental-behavioral pediatrics independently analyzed the transcripts to identify common themes. Five main themes emerged. First, parental mediation of screen media was primarily restrictive, reactive, and focused on technology functionality. Second, active mediation was child-driven. Third, siblings played a more dominant role in mediation than parents. Fourth, parents and children negotiated screen time limits. Finally, parallel family media use was common. Multiple family members engaged with their own mobile devices while simultaneously being exposed to background screen media (i.e., media multitasking). Assessing media use in the naturalistic home environment elucidated current patterns of family media use and communication about media in the digital age. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The Test was designed using embedded design, first described by Kaufman & Flanagan (2015), which diverges from traditional “educational game” design strategies by mixing on-message content with nonfocal content, in an attempt to make the overall experience more approachable and engaging. One challenge of embedded design is that it targets attitudes and actions that are not always proximate to a particular behavior. Games with embedded content forgo explicit takeaways, and their possible distal effects present a challenge to traditional tests of efficacy. The benefit of embedded design, however, is that its holistic or ecological design approach (which considers feelings, emotions, affects, social relations, and connections to broader communities) stands in close alignment with the social-ecological model. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Inequity aversion (negative feelings induced by outcome differences between the self and other) plays a key role in human social behaviors. The neurotransmitters oxytocin and GABA have been implicated in neural responses to inequity. However, it remains poorly understood not only how individual genetic factors related to oxytocin and GABA affect the neural mechanisms behind inequity aversion, but also how these genes interact. To address these issues, we examined relationships between genotypes, behavioral decisions and brain activities during the ultimatum game. We identified interactive effects between the polymorphisms of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and glutamate decarboxylase 1 gene for GABA synthesis (GAD1) on envy aversion (i.e., disadvantageous inequity aversion) and on envy-induced activity in the dorsal ACC (dACC). Thus, our integrated approach suggested interactive genetic effects between OXTR and GAD1 on envy aversion and the underlying neural substrates. © 2019 Tanaka et al.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the students’ self-regulated learning in elementary education when traditional teaching method, which is teacher centered in a classroom, is replaced with a blended approach enriched with open educational resources. Various open educational resources such as videos, simulations, and learning games are readily available on the Web. In addition, mobile and classroom technologies, such as portable devices can be considered as teaching tools in education. The good use of these educational resources and technologies can not only assist students’ formal classroom learning but also cultivate the self-regulated learning of students. The i-Classroom implemented in an elementary school adopted a new teaching method, which made use of the online educational resources and information technology, to achieve this goal. Three surveys (Sample size N = 149, N = 168, N = 150) were conducted to investigate the effectiveness of promoting three key aspects of self-regulated learning: learning motivation, planning and management, and self-monitoring. Focus group interviewed was also carried out to collect the feedback in i-classroom learning. The results show that i-Classroom can help students to enhance their ability in self-regulated learning. © 2019, Beijing Normal University.},

	abstract = {Currently, at the Instituto Parauniversitario Plerus, there are limitations on the part of students such as studying at the last minute, not using reference tools such as textbooks or articles, and studying for a grade and not for the knowledge itself. Therefore, the objective of this research was to reinforce the course contents, the continuous study, and the self-evaluation of the acquired knowledge through the development of gammification tasks to favor the learning of the students of this course. For the development of the didactic strategy, 29 students from Fundamentals of Biology course, at the Instituto Parauniversitario Plerus, took part: 24 of whom completed the course and five withdrew it. For this group, a portfolio and reinforcement activities (plasticine models, homemade experiments, word search puzzles, crossword puzzles, among others) were established. The realization of these activities provided rewards through the gift of stickers to each student. These rewards were collected and exchanged for didactic prizes, such as a percentage in a short exam. A game called Biology cr was also developed in the Reinos® mobile application. In it, each student developed unique selection questions that were reviewed by the teacher and then incorporated to be answered by other classmates. To determine the results, the grades obtained by the students enrolled in the Fundamentals of Biology course were reviewed, and a survey was carried out, which each student completed once the implementation of this strategy was concluded. To analyse the data, a sociodemographic analysis was carried out for age and sex, and a descriptive analysis with frequency distribution was carried out for the rest of the questions. From a teaching perspective, good results were obtained, with 66.7% of the student body passing. With regard to the student perspective, there were positive aspects (improvement in the understanding of subjects, obligation to constantly take up the subjects studied in class and understand them on their own, including personal research, if necessary) and negative aspects (academic load increase, preference for the use of traditional didactic strategies and lack of delimitation of the most relevant aspects of each of the subjects), which must be considered for future experiences. © 2019 Universidad Nacional.

	abstract = {Study Objective: Develop and test the feasibility of a Health Belief Model theory-based interactive smartphone application (app) aimed at providing information and support to adolescents with long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). Design, Setting, Participants, and Interventions: Using a mixed-method design, we conducted 30 in-person interviews with adolescent LARC users who were enrolled in school-based health centers in New York City. Interviews were conducted in 2 phases: during phase 1, 12 participants viewed a pilot version of the app (MyLARC); during phase 2, 18 additional participants interacted with an expanded version of the app. Phase 2 participants downloaded MyLARC onto their smartphone and app usage was tracked. Main Outcome Measures: Participants' responses to the in-person interviews and data usage of MyLARC from phase 2 determined the feasibility and acceptability of using MyLARC to support young women's satisfaction and continuation of LARC methods. Results: Noneducational games were recommended as an approach to provide information to adolescents in an engaging way, as well as educational graphics and visually appealing content. Data tracking of MyLARC usage among phase 2 participants revealed a total of 67 unique logins to the app with 18 average page visits per unique login. The total amount of times MyLARC was opened was 1197. The most frequented features were ‘Info about LARC’ (95 unique visits) and ‘Games’ (80 unique plays). Conclusion: A theory-based interactive smartphone app with LARC-specific information and support is an appropriate and appealing medium to provide information and support to adolescents using LARC.

	abstract = {Introduction: Smartphone Addiction (SA) has caused negative consequences and functional impairments in college students, such as reduction of academic performance and impairment in sleep quality. Studies have shown that individuals with chemical and behavioral dependencies have a bias in decision-making process, which leads to short-term advantageous choices even if they cause long-term harm. This bias in decision-making process is accompanied by a change in somatic markers and is associated with the development and maintenance of addictive behavior. The decision-making process and the measurement of physiological parameters have not yet been analyzed in SA. The neuropsychological and physiological characterization of the SA can contribute to its approach with the other dependency syndromes and to its recognition as a disease. Objective: we aimed to evaluate the decision-making process under risk and under ambiguity in individuals with SA and to measure the physiological parameters that accompany this process. Method: We compared the performance in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), Game of Dice Task (GDT) and skin conductance response (SCR) between 50 individuals with SA and 50 controls. Results: Smartphone dependents presented a profile of impairment in decision-making under ambiguity, without impairment in decision-making under risk. They demonstrated lower SCR before disadvantageous choices, higher SCR after rewards and lower SCR after punishments during decision-making, which suggests difficulty in recognizing disadvantageous alternatives, high sensitivity to rewards, and low sensitivity to punishments. Conclusion: The impairment in the decision-making process in smartphone dependents is similar to that found in other chemical and behavioral addictions, such as alcohol addiction, gambling disorders and pathological buy. The impairment in decision under ambiguity with preservation of decision under risk may reflect dysfunction of implicit emotional processes without dysfunction of explicit cognitive process. This profile can contribute to the recognition of SA as a behavioral dependence and to guide specific preventive and therapeutic strategies.

	abstract = {Background: Encouraging individuals to report daily information such as unpleasant disease symptoms, daily activities and behaviors, or aspects of their physical and emotional state is difficult but necessary for many studies and clinical trials that rely on patient-reported data as primary outcomes. Use of paper diaries is the traditional method of completing daily diaries, but digital surveys are becoming the new standard because of their increased compliance; however, they still fall short of desired compliance levels. Objective: Mobile games using in-game rewards offer the opportunity to increase compliance above the rates of digital diaries and paper diaries. We conducted a 5-week randomized control trial to compare the completion rates of a daily diary across 3 conditions: a paper-based participant-reported outcome diary (Paper PRO), an electronic-based participant-reported outcome diary (ePRO), and a novel ePRO diary with in-game rewards (Game-Motivated ePRO). Methods: We developed a novel mobile game that is a combination of the idle and pet collection genres to reward individuals who complete a daily diary with an in-game reward. Overall, 197 individuals aged 6 to 24 years (male: 100 and female: 97) were enrolled in a 5-week study after being randomized into 1 of the 3 methods of daily diary completion. Moreover, 157 participants (male: 84 and female: 69) completed at least one diary and were subsequently included in analysis of compliance rates. Results: We observed a significant difference (F2,124=6.341; P=.002) in compliance to filling out daily diaries, with the Game-Motivated ePRO group having the highest compliance (mean completion 86.4%, SD 19.6%), followed by the ePRO group (mean completion 77.7%, SD 24.1%), and finally, the Paper PRO group (mean completion 70.6%, SD 23.4%). The Game-Motivated ePRO (P=.002) significantly improved compliance rates above the Paper PRO. In addition, the Game-Motivated ePRO resulted in higher compliance rates than the rates of ePRO alone (P=.09). Equally important, even though we observed significant differences in completion of daily diaries between groups, we did not observe any statistically significant differences in association between the responses to a daily mood question and study group, the average diary completion time (P=.52), or the System Usability Scale score (P=.88). Conclusions: The Game-Motivated ePRO system encouraged individuals to complete the daily diaries above the compliance rates of the Paper PRO and ePRO without altering the participants’ responses.

	abstract = {Background: Tobacco use during pregnancy entails a serious risk to the mother and harmful effects on the development of the child. Europe has the highest tobacco smoking prevalence (19.3%) compared with the 6.8% global mean. Between 20% to 30% of pregnant women used tobacco during pregnancy worldwide. These data emphasize the urgent need for community education and implementation of prevention strategies focused on the risks associated with tobacco use during pregnancy. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an intervention that incorporates a serious game (Tobbstop) to help pregnant smokers quit smoking. Methods: A two-arm randomized controlled trial enrolled 42 women who visited 2 primary care centers in Catalonia, Spain, between March 2015 and November 2016. All participants were pregnant smokers, above 18 years old, attending consultation with a midwife during the first trimester of pregnancy, and had expressed their desire to stop smoking. Participants were randomized to the intervention (n=21) or control group (n=21). The intervention group was instructed to install the game on their mobile phone or tablet and use it for 3 months. Until delivery, all the participants were assessed on their stage of smoking cessation during their follow-up midwife consultations. The primary outcome was continuous tobacco abstinence until delivery confirmed by the amount of carbon monoxide at each visit, measured with a carboxymeter. Results: Continuous abstinence until delivery outcome was 57% (12/21) in the intervention group versus 14% (3/21) in the control group (hazard ratio=4.31; 95% CI 1.87-9.97; P=.001). The mean of total days without smoking until delivery was higher in the intervention group (mean 139.75, SD 21.76) compared with the control group (mean 33.28, SD 13.27; P<.001). In addition, a Kapplan-Meier survival analysis showed that intervention group has a higher abstinence rate compared with the control group (log-rank test, χ2 1=13.91; P<.001). Conclusions: Serious game use is associated with an increased likelihood to maintain abstinence during the intervention period if compared with those not using the game. Pregnancy is an ideal opportunity to intervene and control tobacco use among future mothers. On the other hand, serious games are an emerging technology, growing in importance, which are shown to be a good tool to help quitting smoking during pregnancy and also to maintain this abstinent behavior. However, because of the study design limitations, these outcomes should be interpreted with caution. More research, using larger samples and longer follow-up periods, is needed to replicate the findings of this study. © JMIR Serious Games.All right reserved.},

Participants included 233 eighth graders (108 female; Mage = 13.26, SD = 0.36) from two middle schools in the Midwestern United States. Adolescents completed questionnaires on their endorsement of masculinity and femininity traits as well as how often they engaged in cyber aggression perpetration (i.e., cyber relational aggression, cyber verbal aggression, hacking) through mobile phones, social-networking sites, and gaming consoles. Findings indicated that boys and girls with more feminine traits engaged in more cyber relational aggression through social-networking sites and mobile phones, while boys and girls who endorsed more masculine traits perpetrated this behavior and cyber verbal aggression more often through online gaming. In addition, these boys and girls engaged in more hacking through all technologies when compared with girls and boys who reported more feminine traits.

	abstract = {Background: Major depressive episodes (MDEs) are prevalent in the workplace and affect workers’ health and productivity. Therefore, there is a pressing need for innovation in the prevention of MDEs in the workplace. Electronic mental (e-mental) health programs are a cost-effective approach toward the self-management of stress and emotional issues. E-mental health dropout rate, MDE prevalence, and symptoms greatly vary by sex and age. Thus, the development and implementation of e-mental health programs for the prevention of MDEs need to be examined through a sex and age lens to enhance program use and effectiveness. Objective: This study aimed to examine design feature preferences based on sex and age for an e-mental health program targeted toward depression prevention. Methods: Household residents across Canada were contacted using the random digit dialing method. 500 women and 511 men who were 18 years and older and who were at high risk of having MDEs were interviewed. Internet use was assessed using questions from the 2012 Canadian Internet Use Survey conducted by Statistics Canada, and preferred design features of e-mental health program questions were developed by the BroMatters team members. The proportions of likely use of specific features of e-mental health programs in women were estimated and compared with those in men using chi-square tests. The comparisons were made overall and by age groups. Results: Men (181/511, 35.4%) and women (211/500, 42.2%) differed significantly in their likelihood of using an e-mental health program. Compared with men (307/489, 62.8%), women (408/479, 85.2%) were more likely to use the internet for medical or health-related information. Women were more likely to use the following design features: practices and exercises to help reduce symptoms of stress and depression (350/500, 70.7%), a self-help interactive program that provides information about stress and work problems (302/500, 61.8%), the ability to ask questions and receive answers from mental health professionals via email or text message (294/500, 59.9%), and to receive printed materials by mail (215/500, 43.4%). Men preferred to receive information in a video game format (156/511, 30.7%). Younger men (46/73, 63%) and younger women (49/60, 81%) were more likely to access a program through a mobile phone or an app, and younger men preferred having access to information in a video game format. Conclusions: Factors such as sex and age influenced design feature preferences for an e-mental health program. Working women who are at high risk for MDEs preferred interactive programs incorporating practice and exercise for reducing stress, quality information about work stress, and some guidance from professionals. This suggests that sex and age should be taken into account when designing e-mental health programs to meet the needs of individuals seeking help via Web-based mental health programs and to enhance their use. ©Rachel Smail-Crevier, Gabrielle Powers, Chelsea Noel, JianLi Wang.},

	abstract = {Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is frequently experienced by women of low socioeconomic status in India. It is a human rights violation and associated with negative effects on physical and mental well-being, underscoring the need for effective prevention strategies. Objective: This study aimed to develop a dyadic intervention for the primary prevention of IPV among newly married couples residing in slum communities in India. Methods: The intervention was developed using a community-based, mixed-methods design rooted in couple-interdependence theory and guided by the intervention mapping (IM) framework. It used the six critical IM steps to inform the content and delivery of the intervention: (1) needs assessment, (2) preparation of matrices of change objectives, (3) selection of theory-based methods and practical applications, (4) production of intervention components and materials, (5) intervention adoption and implementation, and (6) evaluation planning. Results: The resulting Ghya Bharari Ekatra (Take a Flight Together) intervention is intended to be delivered in 6 weekly sessions by a trained pair of male and female lay community educators to groups of 3 to 5 newly married couples in the community in which they reside. It uses games, discussions, self-reflections, and skill-building exercises to cover the following topics: enhancing relationship quality time, self-esteem and resilience, communication and conflict management, goal setting and implementation, sexual communication and sexual health and reproductive health knowledge, and redefining and challenging norms surrounding IPV occurrence. The formative work guided the protocol, including module duration and timing (2-hour sessions of convenience to participants), ordering of modules (based on potential level of interest and sensitivity of the topics), content (ie, informed scripts of role plays and films), intervention delivery methods (ie, interactive activities), and selection of the interventionists (based on capacity to connect with participants) and venue (community-based, convenient, and safe spaces). Ghya Bharari Ekatra was piloted between January and May 2018, and evaluation is presently underway. Conclusions: Ghya Bharari Ekatra is evidence-based, grounded in intervention-mapping, and developed and iteratively refined using a community-based participatory research approach, suggesting it has great potential to be an acceptable and effective solution to preventing IPV among newly married couples. © Ameeta Shivdas Kalokhe, Sandhya Iyer, Tuman Katendra, Keshav Gadhe, Ambika R Kolhe, Anuradha Paranjape, Carlos del Rio, Rob Stephenson, Seema Sahay.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Customization, as a crucial way to meet the heterogeneous demand of individuals, exists two fundamental and competing motivations, namely, assimilation and uniqueness. Based on optimal distinctiveness theory, this paper aims to validate the interactive effect of self-expressive customization types (i.e. customization to express individual identity and customization to express a shared identity) and self-construal on consumers’ willingness to pay a premium (WPP). Design/methodology/approach: Two studies were conducted to provide empirical support for all proposed hypotheses. The first study (n = 151) uses a hypothetical scenario of a basketball game to test the interaction effect of self-expressive customization and self-construal. The second study (n = 184) assumes a scenario of designing a t-shirt or a uniform to examined the moderated mediating role of consumer-product identification. Findings: The results reveal that independent (vs interdependent) self-construal will have stronger consumer-product identification for customization to express an individual identity (vs customization to express a shared identity), thus generating a higher WPP. Also, perceived task difficulty is the boundary condition of the research model. Research limitations/implications: This paper makes insightful contributions to the customization literature by strengthening the identity signals of customization and exploring the psychological mechanism and the boundary conditions. Originality/value: This research is one of the first few empirical studies to examine the impact of self-expressive customization on consumers’ WPP via the identification with the focal object. This paper not only expands the literature of self-expressive customization but also provides a new research direction for the research of person-object interaction in marketing. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Objective: Researchers at the Prevention Innovations Research Center at the University of New Hampshire and the Tiltfactor Laboratory at Dartmouth College collaborated with students to create two videogames to teach college students bystander intervention skills in situations of sexual and relationship violence and stalking. Materials and Methods: A key strength of the present study is the collaboration with students to educate game development. The research team pooled its ideas to create a trivia game and an interactive scenario game that were pilot tested on first-year students in a midsized campus of a northeastern university. "Each game included subject matter related to sexual assault and bystander intervention, as well as general campus information so the main themes of the game would not be overt and potentially cause participants to resist shifting their attitudes about sexual assault and bystander intervention." Participants completed a pretest and posttest at each testing session and were invited to complete an online follow-up survey 4 weeks following the session. Results: Researchers found that both games had a significant impact on participant bystander efficacy and attitude scores. The interactive scenario game was especially effective in increasing male attitudes toward bystander intervention. The results were most salient for the posttest; however, there was also an increase in male attitudes at the 4-week follow-up. Conclusion: The student input was invaluable to the success of the game prototypes. With their help, we concluded that gameplay shows promise as an effective way to introduce the concept of bystander intervention and increase bystander attitudes and efficacy in situations of sexual and relationship violence and stalking to first-year college students. © 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

Digital games are effective in chronic disease management; however, research on gaming to improve ART adherence among AYA is limited. Objective: We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of video gaming to improve AYA ART adherence. Methods: Focus group discussions and surveys were administered to health care providers and AYA aged 13 to 24 years living with HIV at a pediatric HIV program in Washington, DC. During focus group discussions, AYA viewed demonstrations of 3 game prototypes linked to portable Wisepill medication dispensers. Content analysis strategies and thematic coding were used to identify adherence themes and gaming acceptance and feasibility. Likert scale and descriptive statistics were used to summarize response frequencies. Results: Providers (n=10) identified common adherence Barriers and strategies, including use of gaming analogies to improve AYA ART adherence. Providers supported exploration of digital gaming as an adherence intervention. In 6 focus group discussions, 12 AYA participants identified disclosure of HIV status and irregular daily schedules as major Barriers to ART and use of alarms and pillboxes as reminders. Most AYA were very or somewhat likely to use the demonstrated game prototypes to help with ART adherence and desired challenging, individually tailored, user-friendly games with in-game incentives. Game prototypes were modified accordingly. Conclusions: AYA and their providers supported the use of digital games for ART adherence support. Individualization and in-game incentives were preferable and informed the design of an interactive technology-based adherence intervention among AYA living with HIV. © Amanda D Castel, Saba Qasmieh, Daniel Greenberg, Nicole Ellenberger, Tyriesa Howard Howell, Caleb Griffith, Brittany C Wilbourn, Kavitha Ganesan, Nadia Hussein, Gabriel Ralte, Natella Rakhmanina.},

	abstract = {The benefits of using digital games in the curriculum are well documented in literature. Most teachers who use digital games use short-form drill-and-practice learning games rather than the kinds of games most students would choose to play in their free time. The use of more interactive, immersive digital games (IDGs) in classrooms tends to be sporadic, dependent upon the enthusiasm and ingenuity of individual teachers. Previous studies have indicated that many teachers have concerns about using digital games in classrooms and have difficulties knowing how to best use digital games. This qualitative study presents a professional development model for teachers that was inductively derived through analysing in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 13 educators who have used digital games in the classroom. Implementing this model can help teachers develop attitudes and skills necessary to meaningfully use interactive, IDGs in their classrooms. Evidence suggests that a mentor should have a strong understanding of how to use digital games effectively in classrooms, work with small cohorts of teachers to collegially plan the use of digital games within a unit of class work, trial the unit of work with a small number of enthusiastic teachers, and then implement it with the remaining teachers. This approach is based on interviews with educators who have successfully mentored teachers in their schools to use interactive, IDGs in their classrooms. These educators encountered little resistance from their teaching colleagues. Their approach further supported teachers who were open to the possibilities of using digital games in their classrooms. © 2018 British Educational Research Association},

We used a 2×2 between-subject experimental design with a sample of 128 undergraduates. We assigned each participant randomly to one experimental condition defined by a particular video game, using four mobile video games differing in the degree of violence and in the level of their frustration-invoking gameplay. Aggressiveness was measured using the implicit association test (IAT), administered before and after the playing of a video game.

	abstract = {Virtual crowds are a prominent feature for a range of applications; from simulations for cultural heritage, to interactive elements in video games. A body of existing research seeks to develop and improve algorithms for crowd simulation, typically with a goal of achieving more realistic behaviours. For applications targeting human interaction however, what is judged as realistic crowd behaviour can be subjective, leading to situations where actual crowd data is not always perceived to be more real than simulation, making it difficult to identify a ground truth. We present a novel method using psychophysics to assess the perceived realism of behavioural features with respect to virtual crowds. In this instance, a focus is given to the grouping dynamics feature, whereby crowd composition in terms of group frequency and density is evaluated through thirty-six conditions based on crowd data captured from three pedestrianised real-world locations. The study, conducted with seventy-eight healthy participants, allowed for the calculation of perceptual thresholds, with configurations identified that appear most real to human viewers. The majority of these configurations correlate with the values extracted from the crowd data, with results suggesting that viewers have more perceptual flexibility when group frequency and density are increased, rather than decreased. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

These deficits are considered one of the main drivers of functional disability in BD. This study investigated whether computerized working memory training using the COGMED® program in patients with BD can improve global functioning, therapeutic compliance, and subjective quality of life. Methods: For this naturalistic prospective study, 40 patients with BD and cognitive complaints were recruited. Sociodemographic, clinical, neurocognitive and functional data were collected before starting the remediation intervention (baseline). At home, patients used the web-based working memory training program COGMED® that included a battery of interactive games (daily sessions, five days per week for five weeks), supported by weekly phone-based feedback. The clinical, neurocognitive and functional assessment was repeated four weeks after the intervention end and compared with the baseline data. Results: Thirty-two patients completed the study. Compared with baseline, general functioning was improved after the working memory training program, as indicated by a mean reduction of 6.78 (SD 4.65) points in the Functioning Assessment Short Test (p<0.001). This result remained significant after controlling for depressive symptomatology improvement. Similarly, the scores of neuropsychological tests for cognitive complaints, as well as verbal and visuospatial working memory components were significantly different before and after the intervention (p<0.05). Conversely, the subjective quality of life and therapeutic compliance did not change.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate the students’ perception of their learning experiences concerning serious gaming and gamification instructions and determines whether they were motivated enough and engaged during the educative process in a resource-poor context. Moreover, the study evaluated the impact of interactive instructional environment outcomes in terms of students’ perceptions of the learning catalysed by gamified systems, particularly in enhancing attitude change coupled with knowledge acquisition. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a qualitative research design technique to collect the data. A total of 108 first year secondary school students participated in a sexual health literacy course that lasted for a five-week learning period. Using a cluster-sampling technique, three classes were randomly assigned to serious gaming, gamification and teacher-centred instructions. Individual face-to-face interviews were used to assess students’ perceives required satisfaction with three instructions. Data were audio-recorded, and coding analysis was used using NVivo software facilitated qualitative data analysis. Findings: The results show that serious gaming and gamification instructions trumped the traditional teacher-centred instruction method. While intervention students were all positive about the serious gaming and gamification instructions, non-intervention students were negative about conservative teacher-centered learning whose limited interactivity also undermined learning relative to the two innovative interventions. Research limitations/implications: As a justification to limit face-to-face classes, this study may be useful during an emergency phenomenon, including the current situation of amid COVID-19. The implementation of serious gaming and gamification as remotely instructional options could be among the measures to protect educational communities through reducing close-proximity, and eventually, control contamination and the spread of viruses. Originality/value: The application of serious gaming and game elements should not be conceptualised as universal but context-specific. This study shows that particularism is essential to optimise the results in terms of coming up with a specific design based on the scope of evaluation for positive results and develop an intervention that will work, especially in the resource-poor context of the developing world. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Media coverage of research on phones and social media over the last decade has prompted widespread concern and one-size-fits-all guidance to limit screen time. Recognizing the limitations of screen time as a metric, researchers are now studying technology use in terms of affordances, individual differences, and longitudinal patterns. The current review examines technology use by parents, caregivers, couples, and clinicians. Individuals in these roles navigate risks, such as privacy violations, with benefits such as improved communication, empathy, and progress toward shared goals. Successful approaches vary by relationship type but have commonalities such as engaging with the technologies used by the other person to open up sensitive conversations, negotiate conflict, and illuminate patterns that would otherwise be hard to detect. To enhance relationships, some individuals depart from the intended use of technologies, for example, adapting connected devices for emotional communication or drawing on games to cope with social anxiety. One promising way in which individuals adapt technology to improve communication involves sharing technologies that were designed for personal use. This review highlights the importance of context, motivation, and the nuances of use to understand how technologies can be optimally used in personal and clinical relationships.  © 2019, AICH - Servier Group.},

	abstract = {Currently, there is widespread social concern about the use of Information and Communication Technologies among adolescents, specifically regarding devices such as the Smartphone. The use of mobile phones has become popular in this group, having a different impact on their lives. In view of the fascination that this device produces on them, it is possible to carry out a study on its use. The main objective of this work is to know the patterns that are deduced from the informal use of the Smartphone as the starting point in the design and implementation of socio-educative intervention, particularly with adolescents who are part of the child welfare system, taking into account the vulnerability and complexity that surrounds this collective. This research is framed in the qualitative methodology, and is part of the narrative approach, based on the collection of data with the technique of the story and the interview. The results and conclusions reveal the existence of different use patterns of the mobile phone by adolescents. It should be noted that adolescents subject the use of the device to the constant use of certain apps, due to popularity, easy handle and free-of-charge system. The use of instant messaging systems apps is notorious, particularly WhatsApp and Snapchat in any age bracket. Instagram stands out as the social network that most teenagers use. In general, these applications are used for recreational purposes. Despite having playful content, the influenceof video games is not relevant to the use of the Smartphone by the collective. Finally, it is important to emphasize the comunicative purpose with which the minors use the Smartphone, with the aim of keeping in touch with colleagues and sentimental partners. © 2019, Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia.

	abstract = {Background: To address the challenge of juvenile obesity, effective therapeutic concepts focusing on lifestyle changes are necessary. A relevant aspect is the media use, which is associated with nutrition and physical activity patterns and is influenced by socio-demographic factors. To optimise obesity therapy, the use of media depending on these socio-demographic factors needs to be analysed to adjust the aims, content and methods of interventions as well as to harness the potential of media use in obesity therapy. The question considered in this research is: What media and physical activity patterns show 11- to 17-year-old obesity therapy participants in dependence on socio-demographic factors? Methods: A national multicentre study was conducted in 2015. A questionnaire was used to survey 432 participants' aged 13.75 ± 1.4 years. Standardised instruments were used to assess the variables: physical activity, media use and socio-demographic factors. Results: The participants were 1-hour physically active for 3.9 ± 1.9 days/week, 14.1% daily. Televisions, mobile phones and computers were available in all socio-demographic groups and used for 2 h/day. Socio-demographic differences emerged in the duration of media use (h/day). Girls were found to use mobile phones for longer (2.49 vs. 1.90; p < 0.01) and spend less time on game consoles than boys (0.55 vs. 1.65; p < 0.01). Conclusion: Compared to current recommendations, the sample shows reduced physical activity and increased media use, which vary between the groups. Hence, differentiated therapy approaches appear recommendable. Future research needs to evaluate, how media (despite its risks) can facilitate therapy, training and aftercare concepts. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg.},

Thirty-seven voice-hearing participants selected two negative voice-hearing experiences. They recalled one of these experiences while performing a lingual dual task (i.e., language game on smartphone app) and recalled one memory without a dual task (in counterbalanced order). During the pre-test and post-test, emotionality and vividness of the voice-hearing memories were rated, as well as the credibility of the voice statements. There was a significantly greater decrease in emotionality, vividness and credibility during dual tasking than during recall only. This study provides proof of principle that the salience and credibility of the content of auditory hallucinations can be reduced by dual tasking; the clinical implications are also discussed. © 2019},

	abstract = {Background: Despite promising outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART), challenges to improving adherence among youth living with HIV (YLWH) exist. Mobile games are popular among youth and may improve skills related to resilience, coping, and ART adherence. This study examines the preliminary effects of an iPhone game/app on ART adherence, viral load, and relevant knowledge and attitudes among YLWH in Jackson, MS. Methods: A RCT with 61 YLWH tested the impact of BattleViro, an ART-related iPhone game, over 16 weeks. Participants, ages 14–26, were recruited from HIV clinics and randomly assigned to receive BattleViro or a non-HIV-related game. All participants received a medication monitoring device. Chi-square and t-test analyses examined baseline differences between conditions. Continuous outcomes were examined using analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) controlling for baseline scores. Cohen’s d effect size differences (ESD) between groups were calculated. Results: The sample was 79% male, 97% Black, and 74% non-heterosexual, with a mean age of 22 years. A third had started ART in the past 3 months. There were no demographic differences between conditions. Examination of ESDs revealed that BattleViro demonstrated promising, but nonsignificant, improvements in HIV knowledge (ESD = 0.50), ART knowledge (ESD = 0.42) and social support (ESD = 0.62). Exploratory moderation analyses revealed interactions between BattleViro and newly starting ART. Those newly starting ART in the BattleViro condition, compared to those in the control, experienced a 0.96 log greater decrease in viral load (ESD=−2.21, F = 4.33, p = 0.04), better adherence (71% vs. 48%; ESD = 1.15, F = 3.90, p = 0.05), more HIV knowledge (ESD = 0.90), and more ART knowledge (ESD = 0.72). Conclusion: BattleViro showed promising improvements in HIV knowledge, ART knowledge and social support. Also, there was improved adherence and viral load outcomes specifically among those newly starting ART. ART initiation may be an opportunity to empower and motivate YLWH to build healthy skills. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Promoting a healthy sleep is a big challenge and becomes a strategic priority in public health, due to the severe consequences on children's development and risk to psychiatric diseases. Interventions that promote healthy sleep, such as those that focus on the dissemination of behavioral and environmental recommendations of sleep hygiene with children, are presented as an alternative. Serious game design offers wide-reaching domains in health applications and is increasing in popularity, particularly with children and teens because of it's potential to engage and motivate players differently from other interventions. This study aims to evaluate effects of serious game on sleep hygiene recommendations "Perfect Bedroom: learn to sleep well," on sleep habits and sleep parameters of healthy children. This is an experimental, prospective and quantitative study. We will randomize children in experimental (n = 88) and no intervention groups (n = 88). The experiment has four stages (pre-intervention, intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up), which will count with participation of children and their parents/guardians. In the evaluation stages, the guardians will answer questionnaires and scales to assess sociodemographic and health data, sleep habits and sleep pattern of their child. The children themselves will answer the following: a scale to assess sleepiness levels, a questionnaire to evaluate the serious game and the game itself, will characterize their bedroom and the activities they perform before sleep, with strategies developed by researches. Intervention with experimental group conducted with the serious game "Perfect Bedroom" will happen twice a week, for 3 weeks in a row, resulting in six sessions of 50 min each. Inferential analysis will be conducted for comparisons between groups and intragroups to measure effect of intervention in primary outcomes (sleep habits) and secondary outcomes (sleep parameters). We expect that the intervention with this game can provide valuable evidence to a new approach in promoting healthy sleep habits, with applications in clinical, educational, and familiar settings, which could diminish future health issues and risk at psychiatric diseases, decreasing the social burden of treatments for these conditions in children. © 2018 Almondes and Leonardo.},

	abstract = {Background: Young sexual minority men in the United States have a high incidence rate of HIV infection. Early intervention among this group, that is timed to precede or coincide with sexual initiation, is of critical importance to prevent HIV infection. Despite this, there are very few published randomized controlled efficacy trials testing interventions to reduce sexual vulnerability for HIV acquisition among racially/ethnically diverse, very young, sexual minority men (aged ≤18 years). This paper describes the design of a mobile app-based intervention trial to reduce sexual risk for HIV acquisition and promote health protection in this group. Methods: This study is a randomized controlled trial of an mHealth-based HIV prevention intervention, MyPEEPS Mobile, among diverse sexual minority cisgender young men, aged 13-18 years. The mobile intervention was adapted from a prior group-based intervention curriculum with evidence of efficacy, designed to be specific to the risk contexts and realities of young sexual minority men, and to include psychoeducational and skill-building components with interactive games and activities. Participants are recruited locally within four regional hubs (Birmingham, AL, Chicago, IL, New York City, NY, Seattle, WA) and nationwide via the Internet, enrolled in-person or remotely (via videoconference), and randomized (1:1) to either the MyPEEPS Mobile intervention or delayed intervention condition. Post-hoc stratification by age, race/ethnicity, and urban/suburban vs. rural statuses is used to ensure diversity in the sample. The primary outcomes are number of male anal sex partners and frequency of sexual acts with male partners (with and without condoms), sex under the influence of substances, and uptake of pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis, as well as testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections at 3-, 6- A nd 9-month follow-up. Discussion: Behavioral interventions for very young sexual minority men are needed to prevent sexual risk early in their sexual development and maturation. This study will provide evidence to determine feasibility and efficacy of a mobile app-based HIV prevention intervention to reduce sexual risk among this very young group. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of smartphones, including in low-income countries, offers an unprecedented opportunity to reach individuals with innovative health promotion interventions. Electronic games delivered via smartphone offer promising avenues for sexual health promotion and HIV prevention, especially for young people. By giving players real agency in a virtual and safe environment, well-designed games can provide a level of experiential learning unparalleled by many other behavioral interventions. The design of effective games for health relies on multidisciplinary insight and expertise. However, relatively few studies discuss the theoretical understanding underlying their intervention. Making explicit the theoretical grounding of a game-based intervention allows articulation of assumptions and strategies, anticipation of outcomes, and evaluation of impacts (including intermediate effects), thereby increasing understanding of pathways to change, with a view to contributing to the development of more effective games. It also helps strengthen the credibility and improve the accountability of games for health. We present the multidisciplinary theoretical framework-integrating intervention design, mediators, and behavioral outcomes-and the structure of an HIV prevention game for young African adolescents that has shown promise in a randomized pilot study in Western Kenya. The central component of Tumaini (hope for the future in Kiswahili) is an interactive role-playing narrative in which the player makes choices for characters that determine how their paths unfold. In addition, a series of mini-games reinforce skills, and the "My Story" component links the game world to the player's own life and goals, and a reward system motivates continued play. With its "choose-your-own-adventure" format, Tumaini is intended to be replayed so that players can experience the consequences resulting from different choices made in the role-playing narrative. Grounded in theories of narrative and applied communication and in social behavioral theories, especially Social Cognitive Theory, Tumaini is designed to help young adolescents acquire the information, skills, and motivation they need to avoid and reduce sexual risks. We close by situating Tumaini within discussion of the theory and practice of using interactive narrative in health promotion, with a view to furthering theoretical elaboration. © JMIR Serious Games.All right reserved.},

Veterans at high risk of suicide used the app over 12 weeks and completed psychosocial assessments throughout the study. We received usage data from each participant’s smartphone. We then used negative binomial regression to evaluate demographic and clinical predictors of usage and generalized estimating equations to explore the longitudinal association between usage and psychosocial outcomes. The most commonly used subcomponents were designed to provide distractions and reminders of sources of meaning. Lower levels of usage were associated with younger and having a 2-year college degree or higher. Exploratory findings suggested a possible relationship between usage and protective factors. Certain subgroups had lower VHB usage. The findings suggest usage may be associated with changes in health outcomes. Future studies should recruit larger, more diverse samples to further explore relationships between usage and demographic predictors. ©, This work was authored as part of the Contributor's official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

	abstract = {Background: Gameful designs (gamification), using design pieces and concepts typically found in the world of games, is a promising approach to increase users’ engagement with, and adherence to, electronic health and mobile health (mHealth) tools. Even though both identifying and addressing users’ requirements and needs are important steps of designing information technology tools, little is known about the users’ requirements and preferences for gameful designs in the context of self-management of chronic conditions. Objective: This study aimed to present findings as well as the applied methods and design activities from a series of participatory design workshops with patients with chronic conditions, organized to generate and explore user needs, preferences, and ideas to the implementation of gameful designs in an mHealth self-management app. Methods: We conducted three sets of two consecutive co-design workshops with a total of 22 participants with chronic conditions. In the workshops, we applied participatory design methods to engage users in different activities such as design games, scenario making, prototyping, and sticky notes exercises. The workshops were filmed, and the participants’ interactions, written products, ideas, and suggestions were analyzed thematically. Results: During the workshops, the participants identified a wide range of requirements, concerns, and ideas for using the gameful elements in the design of an mHealth self-management app. Overall inputs on the design of the app concerned aspects such as providing a positive user experience by promoting collaboration and not visibly losing to someone or by designing all feedback in the app to be uplifting and positive. The participants provided both general inputs (regarding the degree of competitiveness, use of rewards, or possibilities for customization) and specific inputs (such as being able to customize the look of their avatars or by having rewards that can be exchanged for real-world goods in a gift shop). However, inputs also highlighted the importance of making tools that provide features that are meaningful and motivating on their own and do not only have to rely on gameful design features to make people use them. Conclusions: The main contribution in this study was users’ contextualized and richly described needs and requirements for gamefully designed mHealth tools for supporting chronic patients in self-management as well as the methods and techniques used to facilitate and support both the participant’s creativity and communication of ideas and inputs. The range, variety, and depth of the inputs from our participants also showed the appropriateness of our design approach and activities. These findings may be combined with literature and relevant theories to further inform in the selection and application of gameful designs in mHealth apps, or they can be used as a starting point for conducting more participatory workshops focused on co-designing gameful health apps. © Stian Jessen, Jelena Mirkovic, Cornelia M Ruland.},

We described the theoretical basis and process from assessment to implementation where edutainment (talk shows) and communication technology (interactive web portal) was implemented. A female comedian hosted the talk shows. The portal contained an HIV risk profile calculator with individually tailored strategies to lower risk; two videos on real-life stories of unsafe sex and exit strategies to avoid casual or paid sex; as well as online support. We integrated edutainment, social cognitive theory (SCT) and the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). Edutainment techniques like humor through jokes, fun through games, and narrative persuasion through real-life accounts were applied. The SCT focused on modifying attitudes and social norm on sexual well-being, increasing self-perceived HIV/STI risk as well as building self-efficacy and skills in condom use. We applied the ELM to guide communication strategies and message development. For peripheral processing, we used cues like comedian delivery and charisma. For central processing, we focused on argument framing, issue involvement, argument quality, and modeling. The intervention was effective in promoting condom use with casual partners among the target group in Singapore. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Some form of training is often necessary for citizen science projects. While in some citizen science projects, it is possible to keep tasks simple so that training requirements are minimal, other projects include more challenging tasks and, thus, require more extensive training. Training can be a hurdle to joining a project, and therefore most citizen science projects prefer to keep training requirements low. However, training may be needed to ensure good data quality. In this study, we evaluated whether an online game that was originally developed for data quality control in a citizen science project can be used for training for that project. More specifically, we investigated whether the CrowdWater game can be used to train new participants on how to place the virtual staff gauge in the CrowdWater smartphone app for the collection of water level class data. Within this app, the task of placing a virtual staff gauge to start measurements at a new location has proven to be challenging; however, this is a crucial task for all subsequent measurements at this location. We analysed the performance of 52 participants in the placement of the virtual staff gauge before and after playing the online CrowdWater game as a form of training. After playing the game, the performance improved for most participants. This suggests that players learned project-related tasks intuitively by observing actual gauge placements by other citizen scientists in the game and thus acquired knowledge about how to best use the app instinctively. Interestingly, self-assessment was not a good proxy for the participants' performance or the performance increase through the training. These results demonstrate the value of an online game for training. These findings are useful for the development of training strategies for other citizen science projects because they indicate that gamified approaches might provide valuable alternative training methods, particularly when other information materials are not used extensively by citizen scientists. © Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Objective: Childhood obesity is a health issue in the United States, associated with marketing practices in which media characters are often used to sell unhealthy products. This study examined exposure to a socially contingent touch-screen gaming app, which replied immediately, reliably, and accurately to children's actions. Children's recall of nutritional content and their liking of the character were assessed. Materials and Methods: Four- and five-year-old children (N = 114) received no-exposure, single-exposure, or repeated-exposure to a character-based iPad app rewarding healthy and penalizing unhealthy behaviors. Children reported how much they liked the character and recalled healthy and unhealthy items from the app. An ordinary least squares regression was conducted on how much children liked the character by condition. Poisson regressions were conducted on the number of items recalled by condition alone, and in an interacted model of treatment condition by liking the character. Results: Children liked the character more in the repeated app-exposure condition than in the control group (P = 0.018). Children in the repeated and single app-exposure conditions recalled more healthy (P < 0.001) and unhealthy (P < 0.001) items than the control group. Within treatment conditions, liking the character increased recall of healthy items in the single app-exposure compared to the repeated app-exposure condition (P = 0.005). Conclusions: Results revealed that repeated exposure increased children's learning of nutritional information and liking of the character. The results contribute to our understanding of how to deliver effective nutrition information to young children in a new venue, a gaming app. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.},

	abstract = {Background: Long-term physical conditions affect 10% to 12% of children and adolescents worldwide; these individuals are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression. Access to face-to-face treatment for such problems is often limited, and available interventions usually have not been tested with this population. As technology improves, e-health interventions (delivered via digital means, such as computers and smart phones and ranging from simple text-based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) offer a potential solution to address the psychological needs of this group of young people. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of e-health interventions in comparison with attention placebos, psychological placebos, treatment as usual, waiting-list controls, or non-psychological treatments for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCMDTR to May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2017), Web of Science (1900 - 18 August 2016, updated 31 August 2017) and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO (cross-search 2016 to 18 Aug 2017). We hand-searched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and the grey literature to May 2016. We also searched international trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials, and cross-over trials of e-health interventions for treating any type of long-term physical condition in children and adolescents (aged 0 to 18 years), and that measured changes in symptoms or diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or subthreshold depression. We defined long-term physical conditions as those that were more than three-months' duration. We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression using patient- or clinician-administered validated rating scales based on DSM III, IV or 5 (American Psychological Association 2013), or ICD 9 or 10 criteria (World Health Organization 1992). Formal depressive and anxiety disorders were diagnosed using structured clinical interviews. Attention placebo, treatment as usual, waiting list, psychological placebo, and other non-psychological therapies were eligible comparators. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles; discrepancies were resolved through discussion or addressed by a third author. When available, we used odds ratio (OR) to compare dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) to analyse continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We undertook meta-analysis when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were adequately similar. Otherwise, we undertook a narrative analysis. Main results: We included five trials of three interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web-MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), which included 463 participants aged 10 to 18 years. Each trial contributed to at least one meta-analysis. Trials involved children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions, such as chronic headache (migraine, tension headache, and others), chronic pain conditions (abdominal, musculoskeletal, and others), chronic respiratory illness (asthma, cystic fibrosis, and others), and symptoms of anxiety or depression. Participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high income countries. For the primary outcome of change in depression symptoms versus any control, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.23; five RCTs, 441 participants). For the primary outcome of change in anxiety symptoms versus any comparator, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.14; two RCTs, 324 participants). For the primary outcome of treatment acceptability, there was very low-quality evidence that e-health interventions were less acceptable than any comparator (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69; two RCTs, 304 participants). For the secondary outcome of quality of life, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.53 to -0.12; one RCT, 34 participants). For the secondary outcome of functioning, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.18; three RCTs, 368 participants). For the secondary outcome of status of long-term physical condition, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.24; five RCTs, 463 participants). The risk of selection bias was considered low in most trials. However, the risk of bias due to inadequate blinding of participants or outcome assessors was considered unclear or high in all trials. Only one study had a published protocol; two trials had incomplete outcome data. All trials were conducted by the intervention developers, introducing another possible bias. No adverse effects were reported by any authors. Authors' conclusions: At present, the field of e-health interventions for the treatment of anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions is limited to five low quality trials. The very low-quality of the evidence means the effects of e-health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years. Although it is too early to recommend e-health interventions for this clinical population, given their growing number, and the global improvement in access to technology, there appears to be room for the development and evaluation of acceptable and effective technologically-based treatments to suit children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions. © 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.},

	abstract = {Background: There is a pressing need to ensure that youth in high HIV prevalence settings are prepared for a safer sexual debut. Smartphone ownership is increasing dramatically in low-income and middle-income countries. Smartphone games that are appropriately grounded in behavioral theory and evidence-based practice have the potential to become valuable tools in youth HIV prevention efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa. Objective: To pilot-test a theory-based, empirically grounded smartphone game for young Kenyans designed to increase age and condom use at first sex, aiming to establish directionality of effects on behavior change. Methods: Tumaini (“hope for the future” in Swahili) is an interactive, narrative-based game grounded in social cognitive theory. A randomized controlled pilot study was conducted in Kisumu, Western Kenya, from April to June 2017 with 60 participants aged 11-14 (mean 12.7) years. Intervention arm participants (n=30) were provided with an Android smartphone with Tumaini installed on it and were instructed to play the game for at least 1 hour a day for 16 days; control arm participants (n=30) received no intervention. All participants completed a survey on behavioral mediators, delivered via an audio computer-assisted self-interview system at baseline (T1), post intervention (T2), and at 6 weeks postintervention (T3). The postintervention survey for intervention arm participants included questions eliciting feedback on the game. Intervention arm participants and their parents participated in 8 postintervention focus group discussions. Game log files were analyzed to calculate the length of exposure to the game. Behavioral survey data were analyzed using two-sample t tests to compare mean change from T1 to T2 and to T3 for intervention versus control arm participants. Descriptive statistics on game feedback questions were computed. Focus group transcripts were uploaded to MAXQDA software, where they were labeled with deductive and inductive codes. Data were analyzed thematically and compared across demographics. Results: Intervention arm participants played Tumaini for a mean of approximately 27 hours. The intervention arm showed significant gains in sexual health-related knowledge and self-efficacy (both P<.001), behavioral intention for risk-avoidance strategies and sexual risk communication (P=.006), and overall survey scores (P<.001) compared with the control arm at T3. The postintervention survey revealed high subjective measures of the game’s value, relevance, and appeal. Focus groups identified a wide range of knowledge and skills the participants had gained, including setting goals and planning how to achieve them, which was perceived as a key motivator for avoiding or reducing risk. Conclusions: The study supports the need for further research to assess the efficacy of the game-based intervention. If proven efficacious, smartphone games have the potential to dramatically increase the reach of culturally adapted behavioral interventions while ensuring fidelity to intervention design. © Kate Winskell, Gaëlle Sabben, Victor Akelo, Ken Ondeng'e, Christopher Obong'o, Rob Stephenson, David Warhol, Victor Mudhune.},

P3 is a mobile app built on an established health platform, which includes social networking and game-based components to encourage PrEP adherence among YMSM and YTWSM. P3+ includes all P3 features plus adherence counseling delivered via two-way text messaging (short message service, SMS) through the app. Methods: The formative research phase includes usability testing to assess users’ comprehension of P3’s educational content, understanding and use of intervention features, and overall impressions of app functionality, followed by app refinements. A subsequent field trial will identify and resolve any remaining technical challenges. A three-arm RCT (P3, P3+, and standard of care) will then be conducted at 6 iTech subject recruitment venues to assess intervention efficacy and to conduct a comparison of costs to deliver the 2 intervention arms. Results: This is an ongoing research project with initial results from the formative work expected in 2020 and those from the RCT in 2021. Conclusions: P3 aims to provide an engaging, interactive experience that is highly appealing for the target population, leveraging technology already heavily integrated into the lives of young people, and thus meeting users’ needs in a familiar, stimulating way. If efficacious, P3 could be a sustainable, easily disseminated, lower-cost PrEP intervention for YMSM and YTWSM. Further, the research aims to determine the processes that are essential to developing and implementing future health-related gamification interventions. ©Sara LeGrand, Kelly Knudtson, David Benkeser, Kathryn Muessig, Andrew Mcgee, Patrick S Sullivan, Lisa Hightow-Weidman.},

	abstract = {Persian Goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) is one of the globally and locally threatened bovines inhabiting in the plains of Iran. There are many studies conducted on the habitat suitability modeling for the species in Iran, however, seasonal variations in the distribution of suitable habitat has not been yet evaluated. To this aim, we used independent species presence data which were collected in the field surveys as well as those which was reported by the game guards during spring 2017 to winter 2018. Maximum entropy modeling approach (MaxEnt)) was applied to relate the habitat suitability of the species in each season to the potential environmental variables in the presence points. The outputs of the model indicated that elevation is the most important variable contributing to the habitat suitability of the species in each season. Moreover, the distribution of suitable habitats in autumn differs drastically from other seasons. The current protected area network of Isfahan province indicates the lowest efficiency regarding the conservation of suitable habitats in the fall which is very critical as the mating event will occure. Isfahan mostly encompass the suitable habitats for spring and the least situated suitable habitats belong to autumn. Based on our findings, we suggest that the current boundaries of protected area network in Isfahan should be reconsidered and redesigned to cover the year round suitable habitats for the species. © 2019, Department of Environmental Sciences, Arak University.

	abstract = {Background & Aims: Interventions aimed at lifestyle changes are pivotal for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and web-based programs might help remove barriers in both patients and therapists. Methods: In the period 2010–15, 716 consecutive NAFLD cases (mean age, 52; type 2 diabetes, 33%) were treated in our Department with structured programs. The usual protocol included motivational interviewing and a group-based intervention (GBI), chaired by physicians, dietitians and psychologists (five weekly meetings, n = 438). Individuals who could not attend GBI entered a web-based intervention (WBI, n = 278) derived from GBI, with interactive games, learning tests, motivational tests, and mail contacts with the center. The primary outcome was weight loss ≥10%; secondary outcomes were alanine aminotransferase within normal limits, changes in lifestyle, weight, alanine aminotransferase, and surrogate markers of steatosis and fibrosis. Results: GBI and WBI cohorts had similar body mass index (mean, 33 kg/m2), with more males (67% vs. 45%), younger age, higher education, and more physical activity in the WBI group. The two-year attrition rate was higher in the WBI group. Healthy lifestyle changes were observed in both groups and body mass index decreased by almost two points; the 10% weight target was reached in 20% of WBI cases vs. 15% in GBI (not significant). In logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for confounders and attrition rates, WBI was not associated with a reduction of patients reaching short- and long-term 10% weight targets. Liver enzymes decreased in both groups, and normalized more frequently in WBI. Fatty liver index was reduced, whereas fibrosis remained stable (NAFLD fibrosis score) or similarly decreased (Fib-4). Conclusion: WBI is not less effective than common lifestyle programs, as measured by significant clinical outcomes associated with improved histological outcomes in NAFLD. eHealth programs may effectively contribute to NAFLD control. Lay summary: In patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, participation in structured lifestyle programs may be jeopardized by job and time constraints. A web-based intervention may be better suited for young, busy patients, and for those living far from liver units. The study shows that, following a structured motivational approach, a web-based, interactive intervention coupled with six-month face-to-face meetings is not inferior to a standard group-based intervention with respect to weight loss, adherence to healthy diet and habitual physical activity, normalization of liver enzymes, and stable surrogate markers of fibrosis. © 2018 European Association for the Study of the Liver},

The study revealed an important cultural shift in the attitude toward children’s nudity and sexual games, the so-called doctor games. Although these were quite accepted at Danish childcare institutions until the beginning of this century, the study showed that new, pervasive regulations had been established to control the child’s body and its sexuality. A new discourse revealed that fear of child sexual abuse, in particular, had influenced views of children’s sexual games and nudity and that, at times, the child itself was viewed as a potential threat to other children. This marks a new development in Denmark, internationally known for its broadmindedness, and this article discusses the background to this cultural shift in the institutions, and possible implications for the children. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

This study conducted a series of interviews (N = 15) and collected online social forum reports of gameplay (N = 880), in order to determine what the social outcomes of play may be and what mechanisms might be facilitating the social connectedness. Thematic analysis revealed that playing PGO produced a sense of belonging, linked to a sense of place, as well as facilitating conversations with strangers and strengthening social ties. This was due to the use of accessible technology able to be integrated into daily routines, shared passion for the game, and mechanics that encouraged players out of their homes. “Shared passion” was tied to the nostalgic connection many players felt for the franchise.

	abstract = {Background: Young people aged under 25 years make up an increasing proportion of the population in emerging economies such as Kenya, where half of new adult HIV infections are among 15- to 24-year olds. Interventions targeting this age group have the potential to avert HIV infections among an increasingly large at-risk population. Interactive communication technologies offer a promising platform for reaching young people in engaging ways. Objective: Tumaini is a narrative-based smartphone game designed to help young Africans protect themselves from HIV. The objective of this study was to pilot test the game, focusing on the data needed to inform a future randomized controlled efficacy trial, including assessments of study feasibility and safety. Methods: The study took place in Kisumu Town, western Kenya, in spring 2017. The game-based intervention was pilot tested for 16 days with a sample of 60 preadolescents aged 11 to 14 years. Participant recruitment was initiated through schools. Participants were randomly assigned to the control or intervention arms of the study. One parent for each of the intervention arm participants was also recruited (n=30). The intervention arm participants were provided with smartphones on which Tumaini was loaded so that they could play the game at home. Youth completed behavioral surveys at baseline, posttest, and 6-week follow-up. The intervention arm participants provided quantitative feedback on their experience of the game-based intervention at posttest. They and their parents further participated in postintervention focus group discussions. Feasibility-related study metrics were collected on recruitment, enrollment, attrition, safety of participants, and return of phones. Results: Recruitment and enrollment of the 60 preadolescents and parents were successfully completed within 18 days. No participants were lost to follow-up: all youth completed all 3 waves of the survey and 27 intervention arm youth and 22 parents and caregivers participated in the focus groups. No safety concerns were reported. All phones were returned after the intervention period; none were damaged or lost. All intervention arm participants initiated gameplay, recording a mean exposure time just under 27 hours. Conclusions: Findings indicate that it is feasible and safe to test a smartphone-based HIV prevention intervention for very young adolescents in urban and peri-urban sub-Saharan Africa by initiating recruitment in schools and temporarily providing youth participants with smartphones on which the game is loaded. A randomized controlled trial powered to assess the efficacy of the game-based intervention is being designed to be carried out in the same geographic area as the pilot, using similar methods. © 2019 Gaëlle Sabben, Victor Akelo, Victor Mudhune, Ken Ondeng'e, Richard Ndivo, Rob Stephenson, Kate Winskell.},

	abstract = {Our recent work (Boyle, Earle, LaBrie, & Smith, 2017) showed that the efficacy of personalized normative feedback-based (PNF) college alcohol interventions can be improved through the addition of gamified elements including points, chance, competition, and personal avatars. However, participants in that study were compensated with subject pool credit. In the current study, we piloted an upgraded, smartphone-based version of the game, which was designed to be truly self-sustaining (i.e., engaging enough that students play voluntarily without the presence of external motivators). First-year students were invited to play the game weekly for six rounds, with participants submitting and voting on their own questions each week and receiving a novel type of feedback in addition to standard descriptive PNF: opposite peers' judgments of participants' self-reported drinking behavior, or reflective norms. With no play-based incentives, 222 first-year college students voluntarily played the game, CampusGANDR. ANCOVA models revealed that, relative to participants randomized to receive feedback on control topics during the three intervention rounds, those who received both descriptive and reflective feedback on peer alcohol use had significantly reduced normative perceptions and reduced alcohol use two months post intervention. This was especially true among heavy drinkers. The results suggest that our gamified “GANDR” approach shows promise as a self-sustaining intervention and, further, that high-risk drinkers may benefit disproportionately from this methodology. Thus, self-sustaining interventions represent an encouraging avenue for future research and development and may hold the potential to impact risky college drinking on a large scale. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background Tobacco smoking remains a public health problem among adolescents in the United States. While Web-based interventions for smoking prevention have been successful at the individual level, there is still an urgent need to understand their engagement capabilities and their effects at the social level. In the current study, we aimed to (1) learn about adolescents’ subjective experience with a Web-based program called a smoking prevention interactive experience (ASPIRE), (2) obtain suggestions for improvement in ASPIRE content, (3) identify psychological outcomes of ASPIRE, and (4) explore outcomes of social interaction. Materials and methods After a randomized controlled trial with 110 adolescents, 20 adolescent users of ASPIRE, aged 11–18, were randomly selected to participate in one-on-one interviews at four after-school programs in Houston, Texas. Interviews involved questions concerning adolescents’ experience with the intervention. Qualitative data were coded and analyzed using a constant comparison approach for the generation of themes. Results Describing their experience with ASPIRE, participants expressed comfort in material that is tailored to their demographic and preferred interactive activities over entertaining videos. Presenting suggestions for improvement, participants mainly reported the need to include gaming features into ASPIRE. Presenting psychological outcomes, they expressed emotional engagement in the program, shifts in attitudes and beliefs, and unwillingness to smoke. Finally, as outcomes of social interaction, participants reported engagement with others in discussions about tobacco and their need to hold smokers accountable for their actions. Conclusions Adolescents’ reports moved from their individual experience with ASPIRE to their active interactions with family members and friends and their attempt to persuade others to quit smoking. Future Web-based programs for adolescents may be designed with tailoring and game play in mind, in order to provide mobilization skills and foster social interactions against smoking. © 2019 Khalil et al.

	abstract = {Introduction Health-promoting lifestyle behaviours are part of the activities of daily living that influence individual happiness, values and well-being. They play a crucial role in prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among all age groups. Current statistics on mortality, disability and morbidity associated with NCDs are alarming globally. The use of information and communication technology (ICT) for a health-promoting lifestyle behaviour programme enhances health behaviours that are important in the prevention and control of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Our study aimed to map evidence on the use of ICT in comprehensive health-promoting lifestyle behaviour among healthy adults. Methods Eleven electronic databases were searched for the study. We included studies published in English between January 2007 and December 2018 reporting on healthy adults, ICT and any subscales of the health-promoting lifestyle profile (HPLP). Studies focusing on diseases or disease management and studies that combine monitoring tools in the form of hardware (accelerometer or pedometer) with ICT or computer games were excluded. Data were summarised numerically and thematically. Results All the studies reviewed were conducted in developed countries. Most of the studies reported on physical activity, and findings of one study covered all the subscales of HPLP. The use of ICT for health-promoting lifestyle behaviours was reported to be effective in ensuring health behaviours that can improve physical and mental health. Conclusion Our findings showed that there is a dearth of knowledge on comprehensive health-promoting lifestyle behaviour that can be beneficial for the control and prevention of NCDs. There is a need to carry out primary studies on the use of ICT and comprehensive health-promoting lifestyle, especially among adults in low-income and middle-income countries where there are alarming statistics for mortality and disability associated with NCDs.

	abstract = {Animals tend to learn and make decisions inductively, and simple, individual-level behavioural decisions can scale up to yield interesting emergent properties at the population level. The minority game is a theoretical formulation based on the principle of inductive learning, wherein a group of individuals, each facing two equivalent choices, self-organize to achieve maximum coordination. Coordination increases with memory length up to a certain threshold, and thereafter, at very high memory lengths, decisions resemble a random choice game. We invoked and observed minority games in guppies, Poecilia reticulata, by forcing them to choose between two symmetric chambers in a series of repeated trials. At an intermediate timescale, guppies self-organized into a globally efficient state featuring maximum coordination. After a large number of trials, the guppies approached a steady state in which they behaved as if they were randomly choosing between the two chambers. Intriguingly, both the time taken to reach this globally efficient state (i.e. learning time) and the grouping behaviour for decision making depended on the sexual composition of the fish populations. We identified a positive correlation between group size and learning time in the experiments, which we further explored using simulations to uncover the form of decision-making framework at play, testing between a leader-based framework and a consensus-based one. Our simulations supported the presence of a consensus-based decision-making process in the system. This work also provides an unexplored general framework to further investigate and understand simple decision-making dynamics and structure in animal groups. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

	abstract = {Background: Smartphones have become an indispensable part of the daily lives of adolescents in the 21st century, which is characterized by a highly digitized modern world. Besides their many advantages, smartphones might pave the way to compulsive usage and addictive experiences. To remedy this problem, this study proposes an authentic approach which integrates consumer behavior theories and techniques such as unhook and gamification. An education program has been designed based on these approaches to decrease the problematic smartphone use. Method: The participants of the education program consisted of 305 students (48.2% girls and 51.8% boys) with a mean age of 14.57 (SD = 0.74). The Demographic Form and Smartphone Addiction Scale for Adolescents (SASA) were conducted before the education program and three weeks after the education. Results: The results of the paired sample t-test analysis before and after the education program revealed that the SASA total scores decreased significantly (p < 0.01). There are significant differences in terms of gender, mothers’ education and class levels. Conclusion: This research emphasizes the role of an interdisciplinary approach to the addiction problem. The content used in the education program includes strategies that originally aimed at increasing consumption. The effectiveness of the program can be enhanced further in the future along with self-regulatory additions. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Objective: Develop and test feasibility of a mobile videogame intervention to decrease high-risk sexual behavior in black and Hispanic adolescents. Materials and Methods: Iterative design to develop intervention in partnership with target audience. Feasibility and preliminary impact data collected at baseline, following 2-3 hours of gameplay and at 8-week follow-up. Results: Twenty-six 15-17-year-olds completed pilot testing: 16 (62%) were male, 20 (77%) black or Hispanic. Pilot testing demonstrated feasibility, including producing a usable videogame prototype, incorporating videogame testing within a high school, and participants' acceptability of the videogame. Participants' gameplay experience reflected that most would play the videogame again (77%), stated that they felt responsible for the choices they made in the videogame (73%), and would tell their friends to play the videogame (58%). Most suggested adding more videogame content to further engage participants. From baseline to follow-up, participants demonstrated improvements in condom and contraception self-efficacy (P = 0.003), risk perceptions (P = 0.009), and high-risk sexual behavior knowledge (P < 0.0001). Among black or Hispanic adolescents, we found improvements in summary measures of intentions (P = 0.04), self-efficacy (P = 0.003), risk perceptions (P = 0.002), and sexual knowledge (P = 0.0002). Adolescents with previous sexual experience showed similar improvements. Conclusion: Pilot testing of an innovative videogame, developed in partnership with the target audience, demonstrated feasibility and preliminary impact with this cohort of black or Hispanic adolescents. We developed a usable videogame prototype and gained important data about how to enhance the next videogame iteration. Future plans include targeting an older age group to maximize our ability to measure potential impact among sexually experienced adolescents. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {Within the context of learning English for specific purposes (ESP), vocabulary acquisition plays a crucial role in the development of written and spoken communication in both technical and non-technical industries. Thus, the use of vocabulary learning strategies would determine both learners fluency as well as confidence in communicating. This paper analyzes the factor structure of the most frequently used vocabulary learning strategies by Malaysian ESL learners studying at a higher learning institution. A confirmatory factor analysis identified vocabulary learning strategy use as a 3-factor structure, with Dictionary Use, Memory Rehearsal and Activation strategies as the underlying constructs, based on the responses of 201 undergraduates. The instrument used was a 27-item questionnaire, adapted from Gu Johnsons Vocabulary Learning Strategies Questionnaire (VSLQ). Results indicate a good model fit model fit with a chi-square statistic (? = 64.3, df= 32) with p .001 and CMIN/df = 2.010, CFI = .946 and GFI = .939. The implications of the findings are discussed, and suggested practices for implementing vocabulary learning strategies in the language classroom, such as mobile-assisted language learning and game-based language learning; are presented. © 2019 Asian EFL Journal Press.

	abstract = {Interactive media such as video games and virtual reality (VR) provide users with lived experiences that may be dangerous or even impossible in daily life. By providing interactive experiences in highly authentic, detail-rich contexts, these technologies have demonstrated measurable success in impacting how people think, feel, and behave in the physical world. At the same time, violent interactive media content has been historically connected with a range of antisocial effects in both popular press and academic research. Extant literature has established a small-but-statistically significant effect of interactive media violence on aggressive thoughts and behaviors, which could serve as a risk factor for interpersonal violence. However, left unexplored is the seemingly paradoxical claim that under some conditions, interactive media experiences might protect against interpersonal violence. Drawing on advances in media theory and research and the evolution of interactive media content and production practices, the current manuscript suggests ways in which interactive media violence may be leveraged to lower the likelihood of real-world violence experiences. For example, research on both violent and non-violent games has found that players can (a) express guilt after committing violent acts, (b) report reflective and introspective emotional reactions during gameplay, and (c) debate the morality of their actions with others. Regarding VR, studies have demonstrated that (a) witnessing physical violence in immersive spaces led participants to take the perspective of victims and better understand their emotional state and (b) controlled exposure to traumatic or violent events can be used for treatment. Broadly, studies into video games and VR demonstrate that the impact of actions in virtual worlds transfer into the physical worlds to influence (later) attitudes and behaviors. Thus, how these experiences may be potentially harnessed for social change is a compelling and open consideration, as are side-effects of such interventions on vulnerable groups. The current manuscript summarizes emerging research perspectives (as well as their limitations) to offer insight into the potential for interactive media violence to protect against real-world violence victimization and perpetration. © Bowman, Ahn and Mercer Kollar.},

	abstract = {Digital game-based language learning promotes motivation and enables learners to immerse themselves in learning. However, some gaming elements (e.g., competition and challenge) or learning content (e.g., difficulty levels) may have different influences on different learners, especially those with low self-efficacy or academic achievement, as competitive games may lead to frustration. It is therefore important to take students' cognitive capacities into consideration when designing a competitive learning environment, and to provide them with learning content of appropriate cognitive complexity. In the current study, a game-based situational vocabulary learning system that integrated a cognitive complexity-based competition strategy was developed to provide learners with appropriate tasks. A quasi-experiment was conducted in a high school English course to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It was found that, compared to the conventional situational gaming approach, the situational game with the cognitive complexity-based competition strategy significantly improved the participants’ learning performance (in particular, that of the low-achieving students), but it also increased their anxiety. Furthermore, the behavioral analysis showed that the students who learned with the proposed approach accomplished the tasks more smoothly, because the system could take into account players' learning performance and adjust the cognitive complexity of the following tasks through upgrading or downgrading the learners' gaming levels to ensure that individual students learned with tasks at appropriate levels for them. On the other hand, the participants who learned with the conventional game-based learning approach had a greater tendency to fail the game repeatedly. Based on the findings and relevant studies, we also discuss suggestions for future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Approximately 1 in 10 newborns will require basic resuscitation interventions at birth. Some infants progress to require more advanced measures including the provision of positive pressure ventilation, chest compressions, intubation and administration of volume/cardiac medications. Although advanced resuscitation is infrequent, it is crucial that personnel adequately trained in these techniques are available to provide such resuscitative measures. In 2000, Louis Halmalek et al. called for a “New Paradigm in Pediatric Medical Education: Teaching Neonatal Resuscitation in a Simulated Delivery Room Environment.” This was one of the first articles to highlight simulation as a method of teaching newborn resuscitation. The last decades have seen an exponential growth in the area of simulation in newborn care, in particular in newborn resuscitation and stabilization. Simulation is best defined as an instructional strategy “used to replace or amplify real experiences with guided experiences that evoke or replicate substantial aspects of the real world in a fully interactive manner.” Simulation training has now become an important point of how we structure training and deliver improved healthcare to patients. Some of the key aspects of simulation training include feedback, deliberate practice, outcome measurement, retention of skills and curriculum integration. The term “Train to win” is often used in sporting parlance to define how great teams succeed. The major difference between sports teams is that generally their game day comes once a week, whereas in newborn resuscitation every day is potentially “game day.” In this review we aim to summarize the current evidence on the use of simulation based education and training in neonatal resuscitation, with particular emphasis on the evidence supporting its effectiveness. We will also highlight recent advances in the development of simulation based medical education in the context of newborn resuscitation to ensure we “train to win.” © Copyright © 2020 Garvey and Dempsey.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review To review the literature and provide a guide to assessing patients with problematic interactive media use (PIMU). Recent findings 0.3–1.0% of the world population meets criteria for internet gaming disorder (IGD). 26.8–83.3% of adolescents meeting criteria for internet addiction have comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. IGD is associated with increased anxiety and social anxiety/phobias. Group counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy, and sports intervention are associated with significant reductions in internet addiction. Summary With the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 inclusion of IGD under ‘Conditions for Further Study’ and the addition of gaming disorder to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11, the idea that PIMU is a mental health disorder gained traction. Although certain populations may be at increased risk, all children and adolescents should be screened for PIMU given now-normal heavy media usage rates. Effective treatment of PIMU starts with identification and management of comorbid mental and behavioral health problems. Depending on their degree of functional impairment, patients may benefit from various forms of psychotherapy with coordinated outpatient management or may warrant higher level of care in one of several established residential treatment programs. Few studies have evaluated pharmacologic approaches to treating PIMU, but some medications targeting comorbid mental and behavioral health conditions improve PIMU-related behaviors.

	abstract = {Background: The worldwide population of older adults will soon exceed the capacity of assisted living facilities. Accordingly, we aim to understand whether appropriately designed robots could help older adults stay active at home. Methods: Building on related literature as well as guidance from experts in game design, rehabilitation, and physical and occupational therapy, we developed eight human-robot exercise games for the Baxter Research Robot, six of which involve physical human-robot contact. After extensive iteration, these games were tested in an exploratory user study including 20 younger adult and 20 older adult users. Results: Only socially and physically interactive games fell in the highest ranges for pleasantness, enjoyment, engagement, cognitive challenge, and energy level. Our games successfully spanned three different physical, cognitive, and temporal challenge levels. User trust and confidence in Baxter increased significantly between pre- and post-study assessments. Older adults experienced higher exercise, energy, and engagement levels than younger adults, and women rated the robot more highly than men on several survey questions. Conclusions: The results indicate that social-physical exercise with a robot is more pleasant, enjoyable, engaging, cognitively challenging, and energetic than similar interactions that lack physical touch. In addition to this main finding, researchers working in similar areas can build on our design practices, our open-source resources, and the age-group and gender differences that we found. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Although teen pregnancy rates decreased dramatically in the United States over the past decade, the rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among adolescents and young adults increased. STI rates disproportionately affect African American youth and young adults. Innovative, accessible, and culturally relevant sexual health interventions are urgently needed. Objective: This study aimed to identify the optimal modality for a game-based sexual health intervention; develop the educational, entertainment, and technological aspects of the serious game; and demonstrate its usability and acceptance by the target population. Methods: This project was grounded in formative data collection with community-based participatory research principles and practices combined with a user-centered design and development approach. Sexually Active Adolescent–Focused Education (SAAFE) was developed using input and feedback from African American youths aged 15 to 21 years who participated in a youth advisory board and focus group discussions to inform the co-design and cocreation of the serious game. The process was highly iterative with multiple sessions for user input following design changes. It proceeded in 3 stages. Social cognitive theory and problem-solving theory were leveraged to provide evidence-based, trauma-informed education through a serious game. Usability testing assessed the quality of user experience with the prototype. Results: Across all 3 stages, a total of 86 self-identified African American males and females aged 15 to 21 years from the District of Columbia and Birmingham, Alabama, participated. Participants requested a dating simulation game. They wanted SAAFE to be customizable, realistic, entertaining, educational, modern, and experiential, linking consequences to their gameplay decisions. Usability testing resulted in an initial System Usability Survey score of 77.7, placing the game in the 82nd percentile and above average for usability. Conclusions: Initial results suggest that the SAAFE prototype is a promising intervention to engage African American youth in sexual health education using a role-playing game. If proven efficacious, the game has the potential to meet the need for sex education, counterbalance unhealthy portrayals of sex in popular media, and respond to the disparities in the STI epidemic. ©Loral Patchen, Lindsey Ellis, Tony Xuyen Ma, Corilyn Ott, Katie H K Chang, Brook Araya, Sravanthi Atreyapurapu, Amal Alyusuf, Robin Gaines Lanzi.},

	abstract = {Background: HIV disproportionately impacts young men who have sex with men (YMSM) who experience disparities across the HIV care continuum. Addressing antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among YMSM is an urgent public health priority. Technology-based interventions-particularly mobile health platforms-can provide tailored adherence interventions and allow YMSM to engage and connect with others. Objective: The objective of this study was to describe the development of AllyQuest, a novel, theoretically-based, smartphone app designed to improve engagement in care and ART adherence and social support among HIV-positive YMSM. Methods: AllyQuest was built on an established platform for patient engagement that embeds social networking and fundamental game mechanics, such as challenges, points, and rewards. A medication tracker provides reminders to promote ART adherence via personalized adherence strategies that are user and context specific; a calendar allows for reflection on adherence over time. After iterative development with input from two youth advisory boards, usability testing was conducted to assess app functionality, comprehension of the educational content, use of intervention features, and overall impressions of app relevance and appeal. A 28-day pilot trial was conducted with 20 HIV+ YMSM to evaluate intervention feasibility and acceptability. Results: Mean age of participants was 21.8 years (range 19-24), and 95% (19/20) of the participants were nonwhite. The mean time of app use was 158.4 min (SD 114.1), with a range of 13 to 441 min. There was a mean of 21.2 days of use (out of a total possible 28 days). There were 222 posts to the daily discussion social wall. Feasibility and acceptability ratings were high. Overall, participants found the app easy to use and navigate, not intrusive, and had few reported technical issues. Higher levels of app usage were positively correlated with HIV self-management outcomes, and there was a statistically significant (P<.05) positive association between the number of days logged into the app and knowledge and confidence in ability to reliably take HIV medications. Conclusions: AllyQuest represents a new, highly scalable solution that is well-suited to meet the specific prevention and care needs of HIV+ YMSM. The development of this intervention is both timely and vital, given the urgency of the ongoing HIV epidemic among YMSM. © Lisa Hightow-Weidman, Kathryn Muessig, Kelly Knudtson, Mala Srivatsa, Ellena Lawrence, Sara LeGrand, Anna Hotten, Sybil Hosek.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the cosplay practice has become a ubiquitous activity, representing a pivotal way to get in touch with the so-called geek culture and its media content (such as videogames, comics, manga). Cosplaying appeared related to narcissistic fragility which in turn is strictly linked to social appearance anxiety and self-objectification experiences. However, despite the body image centrality in cosplay practice, no studies evaluated cosplayers’ narcissistic vulnerability in association with these body image-related issues. A total of 926 young adults (73.2% female; 47.3% cosplayer; mean age=25.3 years) participated in the study. Results confirmed the direct and indirect effect of narcissistic vulnerability on social appearance anxiety (via body surveillance and body shame) among both cosplayers and non-cosplayers. Overall, narcissistically vulnerable individuals, regardless of their involvement in cosplay practice, seem to experience higher body surveillance and body shame, which in turn might promote social appearance anxiety. © 2020. by the Author(s); licensee Mediterranean Journal of Clinical Psychology, Messina, Italy.

	abstract = {Background: An increase in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as well as an increase in the use of new information and communication technologies among young people in Catalonia is the inspiration behind the idea of designing a smartphone app to promote partner notification of STIs. Objective: The main objective of this study is to design a Web-based tool adapted to smartphones for partner notification of STIs among youth who are 16 to 24 years old. Additionally, the objective is to evaluate the Web-based tool’s role in increasing the patient referral partner notification. Methods: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with a proportional stratification of the sample by center and random allocation of participants to the 3 arms of the study (simple Web-based intervention, game Web-based intervention, and control). This study is being conducted by midwives, gynecologists, and physicians in the sexual and reproductive areas of the primary health care centers. Results: The primary outcome measure is the number and proportion of partner notifications. Additional outcome measures are the yield of early diagnosis and treatment of those exposed and infected, acceptability, barriers, and preferences for partner notification. Expected results include an increase in the yield of partner notification, early diagnosis and treatment among youth using Web-based interventions compared with those receiving the traditional advice to notify, and a description of sexual networks among those participating in the study. Conclusions: The Notijoves is expected to have a sustainable positive impact in the partner notification practice among youth and contribute to increasing the awareness of STI prevention. ©Dolors Carnicer-Pont, Eva Loureiro-Varela, Josep Mª Manresa, Montse Martinez, Àngels Avecilla, Laura Montero-Pons, Gemma Falguera-Puig.},

	abstract = {Narrative games, in which users interact with virtual agents, are increasingly being used in health interventions to change targeted behaviors. In virtual social interactions, based on similar real-life contextual cues, past behavior can predict virtual choices. Here, based on theories in learning and interactivity, we examined the whether following a virtual intervention, choices in social interactions may be particularly diagnostic of future behavior changes. To test this, we needed to (1) leverage a contextualized risk (e.g., involving alcohol consumption): scenario (e.g., having one more drink with my partner) given a target audience (e.g., sexually risky young men who have sex with men (YMSM)), (2) include within this context an evidence-based virtual intervention (e.g., promoting alcohol reduction), (3) instantiate and record a virtual choice (water or alcohol) in a virtual dating game scenario intervention with IA for that target audience, and (4) assess pre and 6-months post-intervention YMSM's alcohol use. Using a Socially Optimized Learning Environment (SOLVE) intervention game with IA and alcohol use measures, we found that virtual water choice (versus virtual alcohol choice) significantly predicted real-life alcohol consumption change. Furthermore, personality factors (e.g., Behavioral Approach System) predicted virtual choices and alcohol consumption change. Implications of these findings are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: This pilot study evaluated the short-term effects of an interactive videogame on changing adolescent knowledge, beliefs and risk perceptions, and intentions to use e-cigarettes, cigarettes, and other tobacco products. A secondary aim was to evaluate players’ game experience. Methods: Participants (N = 80 11–14 year olds) were recruited from 7 community-based afterschool programs in New Haven, Connecticut and Los Angeles, California. The design was a single group pre-post design with replication. A pre-test survey was administered that included demographic variables and knowledge, risk perceptions, beliefs, and intentions to use e-cigarettes, cigarettes, and other tobacco products. An interactive videogame focusing on risky tobacco use situations was subsequently played in four 60-min sessions over a four-week period, followed by a post-test survey. Analyses included paired t-tests of pre-post videogame change, regression analyses, and path analyses testing mediational effects of beliefs and risk perceptions on the relationship between knowledge and intentions. Results: The videogame changed knowledge of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products (p's < 0.001), risk perceptions of cigarettes and e-cigarettes (p <.01 and p <.001, respectively), and beliefs about e-cigarettes and other tobacco products (p's < 0.05), but not intentions. Older adolescents reported greater e-cigarette knowledge and risk perceptions (p's < 0.05), and females reported greater risk perception of cigarettes (p <.05). Beliefs mediated the relationship between knowledge and intentions to use e-cigarettes (indirect effect p <.05). Conclusion: Results suggest that brief exposure (4 h over 4 weeks) to a videogame focused on changing knowledge and attitudes towards tobacco products may have a promising effect on preventing risk for early adolescent tobacco product use, particularly for e-cigarettes. © 2018},

	abstract = {Background: Adolescence is a unique developmental period characterized by biological, social, and cognitive changes, as well as an interest in managing one's own health care. Many adolescents use the internet to seek health care information. However, young people face barriers before they can understand and apply the health information that they access on the web. It is essential that usability of adolescent health websites on the internet is improved to help adolescents overcome these barriers and allow them to engage successfully with web-based health care content. Objective: The aim of this review was to synthesize the usability of specific health information websites. These findings were mapped onto the adolescent neurodevelopmental profile, and a design brief based on the findings was developed to tailor future websites for specific adolescent requirements. Methods: A systematic search conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) identified 25 studies that assessed the usability of health information websites. Adolescent feedback was collected by a mixture of surveys, focus groups, interviews, and think-aloud procedures. Results: A majority of the information websites were developed for specific health issues that may be relevant to adolescents. The most preferred website features were interactive content such as games and quizzes, as well as videos, images, audio clips, and animations. Participants also preferred communicating with other adolescents with similar conditions or learning about their experience through real stories and testimonials. Adolescents found it difficult to use health information websites if they contained too much text, were too cluttered, or had features that made it difficult to access. The findings are considered in the context of adolescent social processes, low tolerance of delayed gratification, and attraction to novelty and mapped onto a neurodevelopmental model of adolescence. Conclusions: Young people's feedback can determine usability and content that make a health information website easy or informative to use. Neurodevelopmental profiles and the users' specific preferences and skills should be addressed in future development of health information websites for adolescents. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

	abstract = {Background: In the United States, young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and transgender women who have sex with men (YTWSM) bear a disproportionate burden of prevalent and incident HIV infections. Once diagnosed, many YMSM and YTWSM struggle to engage in HIV care, adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and achieve viral suppression. Computer-based interventions, including those focused on behavior change, are recognized as effective tools for engaging youth. Objective: The purpose of the study described in this protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of Epic Allies, a theory-based mobile phone app that utilizes game mechanics and social networking features to improve engagement in HIV care, ART uptake, ART adherence, and viral suppression among HIV-positive YMSM and YTWSM. The study also qualitatively assesses intervention acceptability, perceived impact, and sustainability. Methods: This is a two-group, active-control randomized controlled trial of the Epic Allies app. YMSM and YTWSM aged 16 to 24 inclusive, with detectable HIV viral load are randomized 1:1 within strata of new to care (newly entered HIV medical care ≤12 months of baseline visit) or ART-nonadherent (first entered HIV medical care >12 months before baseline visit) to intervention or control conditions. The intervention condition addresses ART adherence barriers through medication reminders and adherence monitoring, tracking of select adherence-related behaviors (eg, alcohol and marijuana use), an interactive dashboard that displays the participant’s adherence-related behaviors and provides tailored feedback, encouragement messages from other users, daily HIV/ART educational articles, and gamification features (eg, mini-games, points, badges) to increase motivation for behavior change and app engagement. The control condition features weekly phone-based notifications to encourage participants to view educational information in the control app. Follow-up assessments are administered at 13, 26, and 39 weeks for each arm. The primary outcome measure is viral suppression. Secondary outcome measures include engagement in care, ART uptake, ART adherence, and psychosocial barriers to engagement in care and ART adherence, including psychological distress, stigma, and social support. Results: Baseline enrollment began in September 2015 and was completed in September 2016 (n=146), and assessment of intervention outcomes continued through August 2017. Results for primary and secondary outcome measures are expected to be reported in ClinicalTrials.gov by April 30, 2018. Conclusions: If successful, Epic Allies will represent a novel adherence intervention for a group disproportionately impacted by HIV in the United States. Adherent patients would require less frequent clinic visits and experience fewer HIV-related secondary infections, thereby reducing health care costs and HIV transmission. Epic Allies could easily be expanded and adopted for use among larger populations of YMSM and YTWSM, other HIV-positive populations, and for those diagnosed with other chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. © Sara LeGrand, Kathryn E Muessig, Alyssa Platt, Karina Soni, Joseph R Egger, Nkechinyere Nwoko, Tobias McNulty, Lisa B Hightow-Weidman.},

Materials and Methods: In this quasi-experimental pilot intervention, 180 third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students in Los Angeles Unified School District participated in a 3-week program that included three Virtual Sprouts gaming sessions, three in-school lessons, and three in-home activities, using a nutrition- and gardening-focused curriculum. Pre- and postintervention questionnaires were used to assess psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior, including knowledge about and self-efficacy to eat fruits and vegetables (FV). Data were collected on FV, whole grains, fiber, total sugar, added sugar, and energy from sugary beverages through the Block Kids Food Screener ("last week" version) for Ages 2-17. Repeated measures analysis of covariance models was used for continuous outcomes, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, school, and free school lunch. Results: After the intervention, the intervention group (n = 116) compared with the control group (n = 64) had a significantly improved self-efficacy to eat FV score (+1.6% vs. -10.3%, P = 0.01), and an improved self-efficacy to cook FV score (+2.9% vs. -5.0%, P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in dietary intake or self-efficacy to garden scores between intervention and control groups.

	abstract = {Previous large-scale studies suggest that internet gaming disorder (IGD) among children and adolescents has become an important public concern. Minors are known to be particularly susceptible to problematic internet gaming use owing to age-related underdevelopment of cognitive control. It has been shown that precursors of addictions appear during adolescence; therefore, prevention efforts must be established targeting minors who have their first experience with addictive substances and behaviors during pubescence. Since the DSM-5 classification of IGD in 2013, studies on IGD have drastically increased in number. Thus, we performed an updated review of studies of IGD in children and adolescents to assess the clinical implications of IGD. The search included all publication years, using PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. Across studies, the presence of IGD had a negative effect on sleep and schoolwork in minors. Additionally, family factors, including the quality of parent-child relationships, were important social factors in minors with IGD. Brain imaging studies indicate that impaired cognitive control in minors with IGD is associated with abnormal function in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. Persistent pathological online game use from childhood may aggravate abnormal brain function; therefore, preventive care and early intervention are increasingly important. Although extant research supports the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for minors with IGD, effective psychological intervention for minors with IGD is an urgent issue that requires further research. This review, which presents updated findings of IGD in minors, is expected to contribute to the development of future research and be useful in clinical practice in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are prevalent experiences that can induce distress and impede social functioning. While most voice hearers benefit from antipsychotic medication or cognitive-behavioural therapy, additional effective interventions are needed to reduce the burden of experiencing AVH. Temstem' is an easily accessible and useable smartphone application that was developed by designers in close cooperation with voice hearers and experts. By using language games, Temstem aims to reduce distress and improve social functioning. Methods This is a single-blind multicentre randomised controlled trial with two arms: Temstem+AVH monitoring' versus AVH monitoring' (total n=100). Participants are adult patients who suffer daily from AVH and will be recruited in outpatient units. Primary assessment in daily life is made by the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) and daily monitoring with the PsyMate app. During an ESM period of 6 days, participants assess their mental state (including AVH and context) several times a day by filling in short questionnaires. There are three 6-day ESM periods: at baseline (week 0-1), post-treatment (weeks 5-6) and follow-up (weeks 9-10). In addition, during the entire 10-week study period, all participants monitor their AVH two times a day with a short assessment via the PsyMate app. Participants in the Temstem+AVH monitoring condition are provided with the Temstem app from week 1 to 6. Other assessments made at baseline, post-treatment and follow-up are based on questionnaires and a clinical interview. Ethics and dissemination The results from this study will provide an evaluation of the effectiveness of Temstem, a non-invasive and easily accessible app for voice hearers, and insight into the determinants of optimal use. Results will be disseminated unreservedly, irrespective of the magnitude or direction of the effects. This study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Centre (METC number: 2015.435/NL53684.029.15).

	abstract = {Background: As the number of internet users increases, problems related to internet overuse are becoming more and more serious. Adolescents and youth may be particularly attracted to and preoccupied with various online activities. In this study, we investigated the relationship of internet addiction, smartphone addiction, and the risk of hikikomori, severe social withdrawal, in Japanese young adult. Methods: The subjects were 478 college/university students in Japan. They were requested to complete the study questionnaire, which consisted of questions about demographics, internet use, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS)-Short Version (SV), the 25-item Hikikomori Questionnaire (HQ-25), etc. We investigated the difference and correlation of the results between two groups based on the purpose of internet use or the total score of each self-rating scale, such as screened positive or negative for the risk of internet addiction, smartphone addiction, or hikikomori. Results: There was a trend that males favored gaming in their internet use while females used the internet mainly for social networking via smartphone, and the mean SAS-SV score was higher in females. Two-group comparisons between gamers and social media users, according to the main purpose of internet use, showed that gamers used the internet longer and had significantly higher mean IAT and HQ-25 scores. Regarding hikikomori trait, the subjects at high risk for hikikomori on HQ-25 had longer internet usage time and higher scores on both IAT and SAS-SV. Correlation analyses revealed that HQ-25 and IAT scores had a relatively strong relationship, although HQ-25 and SAS-SV had a moderately weak one. Discussion: Internet technology has changed our daily lives dramatically and altered the way we communicate as well. As social media applications are becoming more popular, users are connected more tightly to the internet and their time spent with others in the real world continues to decrease. Males often isolate themselves from the social community in order to engage in online gaming while females use the internet as to not be excluded from their communications online. Mental health providers should be aware of the seriousness of internet addictions and hikikomori. Copyright © 2019 Tateno, Teo, Ukai, Kanazawa, Katsuki, Kubo and Kato.

	abstract = {Human impact is near pervasive across the planet and studies of wildlife populations free of anthropogenic mortality are increasingly scarce. This is particularly true for large carnivores that often compete with and, in turn, are killed by humans. Accordingly, the densities at which carnivore populations occur naturally, and their role in shaping and/or being shaped by natural processes, are frequently unknown. We undertook a camera-trap survey in the Sabi Sand Game Reserve (SSGR), South Africa, to examine the density, structure and spatio-temporal patterns of a leopard Panthera pardus population largely unaffected by anthropogenic mortality. Estimated population density based on spatial capture–recapture models was 11.8 ± 2.6 leopards/100 km2. This is likely close to the upper density limit attainable by leopards, and can be attributed to high levels of protection (particularly, an absence of detrimental edge effects) and optimal habitat (in terms of prey availability and cover for hunting) within the SSGR. Although our spatio-temporal analyses indicated that leopard space use was modulated primarily by “bottom-up” forces, the population appeared to be self-regulating and at a threshold that is unlikely to change, irrespective of increases in prey abundance. Our study provides unique insight into a naturally-functioning carnivore population at its ecological carrying capacity. Such insight can potentially be used to assess the health of other leopard populations, inform conservation targets, and anticipate the outcomes of population recovery attempts. © 2019 The Society of Population Ecology},

	abstract = {Background: Alcohol use, and the association between alcohol-related variables and drinking outcomes, seem to be context dependent. We employed Latent Class Analysis, a person-centered approach, to identify distinct subpopulations based on contexts of alcohol use. We also examined if the resulting classes differ in a set of alcohol-related variables that hold promise as potential targets of interventions. Method: Argentinean college students N = 1083; 64 % women; M age = 19.73 ± 3.95) completed an online survey that assessed alcohol outcomes and related variables [motives for substance use, protective behavioral strategies (PBS) and normative perceptions of alcohol use]. Results: Latent Class Analysis identified a 4-classes model for drinking contexts. These classes showed differential patterns of alcohol use (both in terms of frequency and quantity) and also differed in alcohol-related variables. Alcohol use was more prevalent in contexts characterized by the presence of peers, particularly the closest friend, small same-sex or coed groups. Close to 50 % of the sample reported drinking with family members. Students with a high probability of engaging in pregaming and nightclub drinking tend to use more PBS to control how much alcohol is consumed than those who do not drink in these contexts. All the classes significantly differed in their social reasons for drinking and in the number of alcohol-related negative consequences. Conclusions: Our findings revealed subpopulations of college students that are heterogeneous regarding contexts of alcohol use, patterns of use and in a number of relevant variables. These distinctive subpopulations require different targeted interventions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Mobile applications (“apps”) designed for sexual health education have the potential to reach teens and young adults that are hard to reach through traditional platforms; however, little is known about availability of these apps and their adherence to existing guidelines. Following a search on the two major app stores, data from 2,693 apps were analyzed. Only 697 (25%) addressed sexual health, and only 15 (1%) of apps met inclusion criteria for comprehensive programs and their content was further analyzed. The content of most of these apps narrowly focused on sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy prevention and lacked information on puberty, sexual identity, and personal safety. Theoretically grounded strategies including self-efficacy and modeling behavior to strengthen behavior change efforts were largely absent. Last, we identified significant shortcomings in the literate design of these apps, including limited use of interactive features, such as videos, quizzes, or games. These findings indicate that the potential of apps as sexual health promotion tools has not yet been fully realized. We outline recommendations for developing theory- and evidence-based sexual education apps and provide suggestions for health educators on how to select relevant apps when working for youth. © 2017 Society for Public Health Education.},

	abstract = {Background: Gaming techniques are increasingly recognized as effective methods for changing behavior and increasing user engagement with mobile phone apps. The rapid uptake of mobile phone games provides an unprecedented opportunity to reach large numbers of people and to influence a wide range of health-related behaviors. However, digital interventions are still nascent in the field of health care, and optimum gamified methods of achieving health behavior change are still being investigated. There is currently a lack of worked methodologies that app developers and health care professionals can follow to facilitate theoretically informed design of gamified health apps. Objective: This study aimed to present a series of steps undertaken during the development of Cigbreak, a gamified smoking cessation health app. Methods: A systematic and iterative approach was adopted by (1) forming an expert multidisciplinary design team, (2) defining the problem and establishing user preferences, (3) incorporating the evidence base, (4) integrating gamification, (5) adding behavior change techniques, (6) forming a logic model, and (7) user testing. A total of 10 focus groups were conducted with 73 smokers. Results: Users found the app an engaging and motivating way to gain smoking cessation advice and a helpful distraction from smoking; 84% (62/73) of smokers said they would play again and recommend it to a friend. Conclusions: A dedicated gamified app to promote smoking cessation has the potential to modify smoking behavior and to deliver effective smoking cessation advice. Iterative, collaborative development using evidence-based behavior change techniques and gamification may help to make the game engaging and potentially effective. Gamified health apps developed in this way may have the potential to provide effective and low-cost health interventions in a wide range of clinical settings. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.

In the end, the game was divided into: home screen and the living room, kitchen and the square scene, where the sports scene was inserted. To validate the instrument, 15 experts were selected, who evaluated the content, didactics and appearance of the game. Ten adolescents evaluated the appearance and usability. In addition, one questionnaire was used for the specialists and another for the adolescents. The Content Validation Index was used to validate the game, which considered the instrument and the items as validated when an index = 0.78 was obtained. Results: the room scene had access to the kitchen and the square. The sport scene was designed for physical activity and the purchase of food, which would be consumed in the kitchen scene. The experts gave the game a Content Validation Index of 0.88 for the item “objectives”, 0.87 for “structure and presentation” and 0.99 for “relevance”, reaching a overall Content Validation Index of 0.89. For adolescents, the item “appearance” reached the index 0.97 and for the other items, 1.0 and overal index of 0.99.

	abstract = {Background: Mobile health (mHealth) has been shown to be effective in increasing knowledge of sexual health among youth. To date, evaluations mostly refer to interventions delivered via computer, email, and text messages. The possibility of downloading apps on mobile devices has opened up opportunities to develop engaging interventions on safe sexual health promotion. To attract young users and have them engage with a sexual health app, it is important to involve youth in intervention development. Objective: This study aimed to obtain input from youth on the content of a mobile phone app intended to promote safe sex and increase condom use among youth in Stockholm. Methods: This study was conducted at the Youth Health Clinics (YHC) in Stockholm County, Sweden. A total of 15 individual in-depth interviews and 2 focus group discussions (with youth aged 18-23 years) were conducted at the YHC in Stockholm. Areas explored were: (1) youth perceptions of condom use (advantages and obstacles), (2) perceptions of mHealth to promote safe sexual practices, and (3) content development for a mobile phone app to promote safe sex. Results: The smartphone app was developed based on the categories that emerged from the data. With regard to content, youth requested sex education, including information on sexually transmitted infections. In addition, condom-specific information, including practical usage technique, advice on how to have the condom talk, and how to decrease shame related to condom use, was requested. Youth suggested different modes to deliver the content, including text messages, movie clips, and push notifications. It was suggested that the tone of the messages delivered should be fun, entertaining, and supportive. The inputs from youth influenced the development of the following sections of the app: Condom Obstacles and Solutions; Quiz; Games; Self-Refection; Challenges; Stories by Peers (stories from peers and information from a doctor); Condom Tips, Pep Talk, and Boosting; and Random Facts. Conclusions: It is important to use input from youth when developing a smartphone intervention since the success of the intervention largely depends on the level of engagement and usage by youth. Furthermore, if proven efficient in increasing condom use, it is important that the development, including content and mode, is thoroughly described so that the intervention can be replicated. Likewise, if proven inefficient, it is important to learn from mistakes to improve and adjust the intervention. The effect of this smartphone app on safe sexual practices among youth is being evaluated in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial in Stockholm (ISRCTN13212899) and will be reported separately. ©Anna Nielsen, Aspasia Bågenholm, Ayesha De Costa.},

	abstract = {Background: In the United States, young minority men who have sex with men (MSM) are most likely to become infected with HIV. The use of antiretroviral medications to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection (pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP) is an efficacious and promising prevention strategy. There have been significant advances regarding PrEP, including the definitive demonstration that PrEP reduces HIV acquisition and the development of clinical prescribing guidelines. Despite these promising events, the practical implementation of PrEP can be challenging. Data show that PrEP's safety and effectiveness could be greatly compromised by suboptimal adherence to treatment, and there is concern about the potential for an increase in HIV risk behavior among PrEP users. Due to these challenges, the prescribing of PrEP should be accompanied by behavioral interventions to promote adherence. Objective: This study aimed to develop an immersive, action-oriented iPhone gaming intervention to improve motivation for adherence to PrEP. Methods: Game development was guided by social learning theory, taking into consideration the perspectives of young adult MSM who are taking PrEP. A total of 20 young men who have sex with men (YMSM; aged 18-35 years) were recruited from a sexually transmitted infection (STI), HIV testing, and PrEP care clinic in Jackson, Mississippi, between October 2016 and June 2017. They participated in qualitative interviews guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model of behavior change. The mean age of participants was 26 years, and all the participants identified as male. Acceptability of the game was assessed with the Client Service Questionnaire and session evaluation form. Results: A number of themes emerged that informed game development. YMSM taking PrEP desired informational game content that included new and comprehensive details about the effectiveness of PrEP, details about PrEP as it relates to doctors' visits, and general information about STIs other than HIV. Motivational themes that emerged were the desire for enhancement of future orientation; reinforcement of positive influences from partners, parents, and friends; collaboration with health care providers; decreasing stigma; and a focus on personal relevance of PrEP-related medical care. Behavioral skills themes centered around self-efficacy and strategies for adherence to PrEP and self-care. Conclusions: We utilized youth feedback, IMB, and agile software development to create a multilevel, immersive, action-oriented iPhone gaming intervention to improve motivation for adherence to PrEP. There is a dearth of gaming interventions for persons on PrEP. This study is a significant step in working toward the development and testing of an iPhone gaming intervention to decrease HIV risk and promote adherence to PrEP for YMSM. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.

	abstract = {Objectives: Sexual health discussions between parents and their preadolescent youth can delay sexual debut and increase condom and contraceptive use. However, parents frequently report being uncomfortable talking with their youth about sex, often reporting a lack of self-efficacy and skills to inform and motivate responsible decision making by youth. Intergenerational games may support parent-youth sexual health communication. The purpose of this study was to explore parent and youth perspectives on a proposed intergenerational game designed to increase effective parent-youth sexual health communication and skills training. Materials and Methods: Eight focus groups were conducted: four with parents (n=20) and four with their 11-14-year-old youth (n=19), to identify similarities and differences in perspectives on gaming context, delivery channel, content, and design (components, features, and function) that might facilitate dyadic sexual health communication. Results: Participants concurred that a sex education game could improve communication while being responsive to family time constraints. They affirmed the demand for an immersive story-based educational adventure game using mobile platforms and flexible communication modalities. Emergent themes informed the development of a features inventory (including educational and gaming strategies, communication components, channel, and setting) and upper-level program flow to guide future game development. Conclusions: This study supports the potential of a game to be a viable medium to bring a shared dyadic sexual health educational experience to parents and youth that could engage them in a motivationally appealing way to meaningfully impact their sexual health communication and youth sexual risk behaviors. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Extant evidence suggests that the proportion of adolescents suffering from anxiety disorders (ADs) has increased by up to 70% since the mid-1980s, with experience of anxiety at this stage associated with significant negative short- and long-term life outcomes. The existing therapeutic interventions (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT; attention bias modification, ABM) have proven to have clinically measurable benefits in reducing anxiety, but their efficacy is often compromised by social and practical barriers. The growing discrepancy between demand for, and access to, clinical interventions for anxiety has led to the development of a range of eHealth (health care practice supported by electronic processes and communication) and mHealth (versions of eHealth using mobile devices) interventions. One such protocol is therapeutic games, which aim to provide clinical frameworks in dynamic, adaptable, and personalized virtual environments. Although some evidence exists to suggest therapeutic games are associated with reductions in subjective anxiety and observed stress reactivity, there is currently, to our knowledge, no systematic review of the adherence to, and effectiveness of, therapeutic games for adolescent anxiety. Objective: The aim of this review was to establish the effectiveness of therapeutic games in making clinically measurable reductions in anxiety symptoms in adolescent samples. Methods: A systematic search of the existing academic literature published between 1990 and July 2017 was conducted using the databases Journal of Medical Internet Research, Journal Storage, Psychology Articles, Psychology Info, ScienceDIRECT, and Scopus. Records linked to empirical papers on therapeutic games for anxiety using adolescent samples were evaluated. Results: A total of 5 studies (N=410 participants) met the inclusion criteria, and 3 gamified anxiety interventions for adolescents were identified. The papers included a mixture of randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and usability studies comprising quantitative and qualitative measures, with varying degrees of mixed methods. Extant evidence shows potential for therapeutic games to create clinically measurable reductions in symptoms of anxiety in adolescent samples, though findings are complicated in some cases by a low sample size, and in other cases by research design and methodological complications, including anxiety reductions in control groups caused by a control-game selection. Conclusions: Although research in this field appears to be extremely limited, as demonstrated by the small number of papers meeting the inclusion criteria for this review, early findings suggest that therapeutic games have potential in helping to engage adolescents with anxiety and lead to clinically measurable reductions in symptoms. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to further investigate the relationship between internet addiction and substance use disorder by exploring the prevalence of internet addiction among patients in a substance use disorder treatment clinic and to investigate the frequency with which internet addiction co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders in this population. Method: A survey, containing questions based on the nine criteria for internet gaming disorder proposed in the research appendix to DSM-5, was administered at 24 outpatient clinics for substance use disorders within the Stockholm Centre for Dependency Disorders. Data concerning additional psychiatric diagnoses was collected from patient medical records. A total of 569 patients participated, after excluding those with missing data as well as participants who primarily gambled online, the final sample size was N=462. Results: In total, 4.1% of the surveyed patients with substance use disorder met at least five out of nine internet addiction criteria at a level of "Fairly true" or higher, and reported at least "Some suffering" as a consequence of their internet use. An independent-samples t-test comparing the mean of the total internet addiction score between groups of patients with additional psychiatric diagnoses and the rest of the sample showed that participants with any one additional non-substance related psychiatric diagnose as well as those with an anxiety diagnose had significantly higher internet addiction scores than the rest of the sample. There were no significant differences in mean internet addiction scores between participants with ADHD or depression and the remaining sample. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence to suggest that internet addiction does not constitute a major clinical issue for patients in treatment for substance use disorder, lending little support to the suggestion that internetrelated problem behaviours share pathophysiology with substance use disorders. Although patients with an anxiety disorder reported elevated internet addiction scores compared to the remaining sample this finding should be replicated in a population of patients who report with anxiety disorder as their primary problem. The presence of clinically relevant co-occurrence between internet addiction and substance use disorder needs to be further investigated in larger study populations, using clinical interviews to assess both diagnoses. © 2017 Giovanni Fioriti Editore s.r.l.},

The present review focuses on new paper-based tests for point-of-care (POC) infectious disease testing. This review provides a brief presentation of the fabrication techniques and the main sample preparation procedures. Recent immunological and molecular testing formats based on new paper-based solutions which go beyond conventional lateral flow formats are also added. Emphasis is placed on how paper systems could be used for detecting whole and viable bacteria associated to infectious diseases. Paper has recently become attractive, since it is a ubiquitous and extremely cheap material. It is easy to store, easy to use, and is compatible with many (bio)chemical and (bio)medical applications. Paper absorbs and transports liquids by capillary force without additional mechanical assistance. Hence, paper-based analytical devices are promising and possibly game-changing, even if they still suffer from limitations, including accuracy and sensitivity. It is anticipated that, in the near future, with advances in fabrication procedures and associated analytical techniques, there will be a continuous flow of innovative paper-based diagnostics kits. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Linnaeus 1758, Phasianidae) is a common game bird in Europe and it is classified as SPEC 2 (Species of European Conservation Concern), that is, a species with unfavorable conservation status due to a marked population decline. Loss of suitable habitat and hunting management are considered among the major causes of its decline. Such a decline can be also related to agriculture intensification, changes in agricultural practices and the abandonment of less productive lands. Habitat suitability models are an important management tool to define the potential distribution range of a given species, design a protected area network, and plan appropriate management actions and evaluate their effects. This study was conducted on Elba Island (Tuscany) in spring 2011 to define the habitat factors that affect the A. rufa distribution in a typical Mediterranean landscape. On this island the species is declining, as it is in other areas of Europe. We carried out point counts in a survey stratified according to vegetation. We formulated Resource Probability Selection Functions following a presence vs. availability design by Binary Logistic Regression Analysis to obtain a map of potential distribution of the species. We observed that the red-legged partridge distribution was mainly linked to the natural habitat with garrigue and perennial meadows, whereas woody landscape had a negative effect. To stop the species decline on the island habitat improvement actions are needed, such as the cutting of dense vegetation to create open areas. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Unione Zoologica Italiana.},

	abstract = {The progress of mobile communication, the advent of electronic gadgets and portable devices, the development of the Internet and social networks, etc. have brought about a profound change in the way people, especially young people, seek information so as to make the best decisions when purchasing products, brands, services, etc. Millennials/Generation Y members (people born between 1980/1981 and 1994/1995) and Generation Z members (people born between 1994/1995 and 2010) spend more and more hours daily in the virtual environment, listening to music, playing games, communicating or exchanging information and impressions. Gen Xers (people born between 1965 and 1979/1980) also use the digital environment to seek information about the characteristics of products selected during the purchasing process, but in parallel with traditional channels of communication, which they continue to heavily rely upon. Being aware of these realities, the authors conducted an exploratory empirical study of Generation X, Y and Z members in an emerging market (Romania), which highlights the way these generations identify the products that best suit their expectations and preferences. In their study, the authors set to identify the relevant factors that determine the use of social networks by the three generations of consumers to communicate and seek information, as well as the connection between social media communication and information seeking, and the use of personal sources of information (family, friends, colleagues, other consumers) during the buying decision-making process. © University of Latvia, 2002-2017.},

	abstract = {Background: With ongoing concerns about the sexual health and wellbeing of young people, there is increasing need to innovate intervention approaches. Engaging parents as agents to support their children, alongside capitalising on increasingly sophisticated technological options could jointly enhance support. Converting existing programmes into interactive game based options has the potential to broaden learning access whilst preserving behaviour change technique fidelity. However the acceptability of this approach and viability of adapting resources in this way is yet to be established. This paper reports on the process of converting an existing group programme ("What Should We Tell the Children?") and tests the acceptability within a community setting. Methods: Translation of the original programme included selecting exercises and gathering user feedback on character and message framing preferences. For acceptability testing, parents were randomised to either the game (n = 106) or a control (non-interactive webpage) condition (n = 76). At time 1 all participants completed a survey on demographics, computer literacy and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) items. Post intervention (time 2) users repeated the TPB questions in addition to acceptability items. Interviews (n = 17) were conducted 3 months post intervention to gather qualitative feedback on transfer of learning into real life. Results: The process of conversion identified clear preferences for first person role play, home setting and realistic characters alongside positively phrased feedback. Evaluation results show that the game was acceptable to parents on cognitive and emotional dimensions, particularly for parents of younger children. Acceptability was not influenced by baseline demographics, computer skills or baseline TPB variables. MANOVA analysis and qualitative feedback suggest potential for effective translation of learning into real life. However attrition was more likely in the game condition, potentially due to feedback text volume. Conclusions: A manualised group programme can be viably converted into a serious game format which is both cognitively and emotionally acceptable. The intervention may be more effectively targeted at parents with younger children, and further game developments must particularly address information dosing. Establishing the viability of digitally converting a group programme is a significant step forward for implementation focused research. © 2015 Bayley and Brown.},

The objective of this paper is to bridge this knowledge gap by quantifying the gamification features that are consistently found in successful applications. Knowledge gained from this work will inform designers about the gamification features that lead to higher chances of an application's success, and the gamification features that do not significantly impact the success of an application. The case study presented in this work leverages demographic heterogeneity and scale of applications existing within mobile platforms to evaluate the impact of gamification features on the success or failure of those applications. The successful game design features identified have the potential to be embedded into interactive gamification platforms across various fields such as healthcare, education, military and marketing, in order to maintain or enhance user engagement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Five focus groups were conducted to capture participants' perceptions of a theory-based gamified self-monitoring app for improving vegetable intake of young adults. Ranking activities were used to gather feedback on preferences for social media posts. Data arising from group discussion were analysed using NVivo software using a deductive approach to group common ideas into themes. Thirty two participants (14 males) attended (mean age 23.1 (SD 2.7) years). Qualitative analyses of open discussion revealed two major themes regarding preferred features for a smartphone app; (1) the use of visual guides for estimating quantities of vegetables and tracking progress, and (2) a simple interface. Gamification strategies such as earning badges were viewed more positively than the use of a self-reward framework. Social media posts which presented food pictures and recipes were ranked most motivating, while awareness-raising posts received lower scores. Participants indicated a preference for viewing but reluctance to post information onto social media. “Just in time” situational cues were ranked highly and the use of an “authoritative” tone was preferred and associated with credibility. Young adults also ranked messages containing “Gen Y” language highly, with a preference for those which were personally relevant. The proposed use of social media and mobile-gaming was seen as an acceptable approach for improving vegetable intake. Materials should be visually appealing, simply designed, credible, and personally relevant to appeal to this population. This feedback may inform future mobile-phone based interventions targeting improved nutrition in young adults. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are increasing among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), yet few HIV prevention programs have studied this population. Keep It Up! (KIU!), an online HIV prevention program tailored to diverse YMSM, was developed to fill this gap. The KIU! 2.0 randomized controlled trial (RCT) was launched to establish intervention efficacy. Objective: The objective of the KIU! study is to advance scientific knowledge of technology-based behavioral HIV prevention, as well as improve public health by establishing the efficacy of an innovative electronic health (eHealth) prevention program for ethnically and racially diverse YMSM. The intervention is initiated upon receipt of a negative HIV test result, based on the theory that testing negative is a teachable moment for future prevention behaviors. Methods: This is a two-group, active-control RCT of the online KIU! intervention. The intervention condition includes modules that use videos, animation, games, and interactive exercises to address HIV knowledge, motivation for safer behaviors, self-efficacy, and behavioral skills. The control condition reflects HIV information that is readily available on many websites, with the aim to understand how the KIU! intervention improves upon information that is currently available online. Follow-up assessments are administered at 3, 6, and 12 months for each arm. Testing for urethral and rectal sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is completed at baseline and at 12-month follow-up for all participants, and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups for participants who test positive at baseline. The primary behavioral outcome is unprotected anal sex at all follow-up points, and the primary biomedical outcome is incident STIs at 12-month follow-up. Results: Consistent with study aims, the KIU! technology has been successfully integrated into a widely-used health technology platform. Baseline enrollment for the RCT was completed on December 30, 2015 (N=901), and assessment of intervention outcomes is ongoing at 3-, 6-, and 12-month time points. Upon collection of all data, and after the efficacy of the intervention has been evaluated, we will explore whether the KIU! intervention has differential efficacy across subgroups of YMSM based on ethnicity/race and relationship status. Conclusions: Our approach is innovative in linking an eHealth solution to HIV and STI home testing, as well as serving as a model for integrating scalable behavioral prevention into other biomedical prevention strategies. © Brian Mustanski, Krystal Madkins, George J Greene, Jeffrey T Parsons, Brent A Johnson, Patrick Sullivan, Michael Bass, Rebekah Abel.

	abstract = {The aim of our work is to design bodily mood expressions of humanoid robots for interactive settings that can be recognized by users and have (positive) effects on people who interact with the robots. To this end, we develop a parameterized behavior model for humanoid robots to express mood through body language. Different settings of the parameters, which control the spatial extent and motion dynamics of a behavior, result in different behavior appearances expressing different moods. In this study, we applied the behavior model to the gestures of the imitation game performed by the NAO robot to display either a positive or a negative mood. We address the question whether robot mood displayed simultaneously with the execution of functional behaviors in a task can (a) be recognized by participants and (b) produce contagion effects. Mood contagion is an automatic mechanism that induces a congruent mood state by means of the observation of another person’s emotional expression. In addition, we varied task difficulty to investigate how the task load mediates the effects. Our results show that participants are able to differentiate between positive and negative robot mood and they are able to recognize the behavioral cues (the parameters) we manipulated. Moreover, self-reported mood matches the mood expressed by the robot in the easy task condition. Additional evidence for mood contagion is provided by the fact that we were able to replicate an expected effect of negative mood on task performance: in the negative mood condition participants performed better on difficult tasks than in the positive mood condition, even though participants’ self-reported mood did not match that of the robot. © 2015, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: To address the need for risk behavior reduction and human immunodeficiency virus prevention interventions that capture adolescents "where they live," we created a tablet-based videogame to teach skills and knowledge and influence psychosocial antecedents for decreasing risk and preventing human immunodeficiency virus infection in minority youth in schools, after-school programs, and summer camps. Methods: We developed PlayForward: Elm City Stories over a 2-year period, working with researchers, commercial game designers, and staff and teens from community programs. The videogame PlayForward provides an interactive world where players, using an avatar, "travel" through time, facing challenges such as peer pressure to drink alcohol or engage in risky sexual behaviors. Players experience how their choices affect their future and then are able to go back in time and change their choices, creating different outcomes. A randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of PlayForward. Participants were randomly assigned to play PlayForward or a set of attention/time control games on a tablet at their community-based program. Assessment data were collected during face-to-face study visits and entered into a web-based platform and unique real-time "in-game" PlayForward data were collected as players engaged in the game. The innovative methods of this randomized controlled trial are described. We highlight the logistical issues of conducting a large-scale trial using mobile technology such as the iPad®, and collecting, transferring, and storing large amounts of in-game data. We outline the methods used to analyze the in-game data alone and in conjunction with standardized assessment data to establish correlations between behaviors during gameplay and those reported in real life. We also describe the use of the in-game data as a measure of fidelity to the intervention. Results: In total, 333 boys and girls, aged 11-14 years, were randomized over a 14-month period: 166 were assigned to play PlayForward and 167 to play the control games. To date (as of 1 March 2016), 18 have withdrawn from the study; the following have completed the protocol-defined assessments: 6 weeks: 271 (83%), 3 months: 269 (84%), 6 months: 254 (79%), 12 months: 259 (82%), and 24 months: is ongoing with 152 having completed out of the 199 participants (76%) who were eligible to date (assessment windows were still open). Conclusion: Videogames can be developed to address complex behaviors and can be subject to empiric testing using community-based randomized controlled trials. Although mobile technologies pose challenges in their use as interventions and in the collection and storage of data they produce, they provide unique opportunities as new sources of potentially valid data and novel methods to measure the fidelity of digitally delivered behavioral interventions. © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {Students' attitudes, their perceptions of cognitive and affective quality as predictors of attitudes, and the resulting intention toward learning with serious games remains ambiguous, largely due to the use of imprecise measures. The presented studies have aimed to develop and test a measurement of students' attitudes, perceptions, and intentions to learn with serious games in general, and to use the instrument to examine differences for the most common types of serious games, that is quiz, simulation, and adventure. To this end, a pretest (n = 301) and two main studies (Study 1: n = 135, Study 2: n = 375) were conducted. The developed instrument shows high reliability and convergent validity. Results demonstrate positive attitudes, positive cognitive perceptions, and high positive and low negative affective perceptions of students toward learning with serious games in general, as well as with different game types. Findings from a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), however, indicate differences between the three game types that could be related to the perceptions of cognitive and affective quality. Predominately, compared to quizzes and adventures, simulations were perceived as more supportive for the comprehension and application of knowledge while promoting a less positive affect. Additionally, there was a significant difference due to gender. Whereas females reported higher perceptions of negative affective quality compared to males when serious games were addressed in general, answers to questions about the specific game types revealed a more detailed picture. In contrast to previous findings in existing literature, female students reported a more positive attitude, as well as higher perceptions of positive affective quality, than males for all three game types. These results stress the importance of examining the types of serious games separately and considering gender when evaluating students' attitudes and perceptions when learning with serious games. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Background and aims: This study focuses on the use of popular information and communication technologies (ICTs) by adolescents: the Internet, mobile phones, and video games. The relationship of ICT use and experiential avoidance (EA), a construct that has emerged as underlying and transdiagnostic to a wide variety of psychological problems, including behavioral addictions, is examined. EA refers to a self-regulatory strategy involving efforts to control or escape from negative stimuli such as thoughts, feelings, or sensations that generate strong distress. This strategy, which may be adaptive in the short term, is problematic if it becomes an inflexible pattern. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore whether EA patterns were associated with addictive or problematic use of ICT in adolescents. Methods: A total of 317 students of the Spanish southeast between 12 and 18 years old were recruited to complete a questionnaire that included questions about general use of each ICTs, an experiential avoidance questionnaire, a brief inventory of the Big Five personality traits, and specific questionnaires on problematic use of the Internet, mobile phones, and video games. Results: Correlation analysis and linear regression showed that EA largely explained results regarding the addictive use of the Internet, mobile phones, and video games, but not in the same way. As regards gender, boys showed a more problematic use of video games than girls. Concerning personality factors, conscientiousness was related to all addictive behaviors. Discussion and conclusions: We conclude that EA is an important construct that should be considered in future models that attempt to explain addictive behaviors. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction Currently, many sunscreen mobile apps are available for use. However, little is known about their characteristics. We aimed to describe the available sunscreen mobile apps for Android and iOS. Material and methods An observational descriptive study was conducted. We searched in App Store and Google Play Store using specific terms in Spanish and English, and collected the mobile apps that aimed to improve sunscreen use. We extracted general characteristics from all of these apps, and specific characteristics from free apps. Results We found 134 apps that aimed to improve sunscreen use, of which 88 (65.7%) were available only in English, 92 (68.7%) were free of charge, and 53 (39.6%) were updated in 2015 or 2016. We evaluated specific sun protection features of free apps: 5 (5.4%) included videos or animations, 2 (2.2%) included games, 28 (30.4%) had institutional certification, 64 (69.6%) indicated the UV index according to user current location, and 16 (17.4%) informed about the appropriate sunscreen use. Discussion The majority of dermatology-related apps were available for free maybe because of their high demand among users. Moreover, they were downloaded mostly more than 1000 times perhaps due to a major concern about the harmful consequences of the UV-rays on health among people. Most of the mobile apps evaluated had no institutional certification that is important for guarantee an appropriate display of information on the app. Conclusions Most of sunscreen mobile apps were available free of charge and were recently updated. However, few free apps have institutional certification, interactive features, and sunscreen use information; which may limit their impact. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

Hierarchical linear regression models revealed that study aid success rate (a metric for assessing performance through the study aids) was a significant predictor of anatomy test improvement with the game (β = 0.41, p = 0.05), but not for the non-game (β = 0.14, p = 0.56). Our analyses suggest that game mechanics encouraged more specific problem-solving strategies than did the control study aid, leading to greater predictability of learning outcomes. There was a non-significant trend among game treatment participants, who were more likely to complete study tasks than those assigned to the control treatment (p = 0.11). It would appear that students' studying habits had the greatest influence (though opposite in both tools) on level of engagement in study aid use. However, contrary to expectations, self-reported gaming habits did not impact participation. Overall, these findings support the integration of game design into undergraduate study aids as a means of increasing use of supplementary educational tools and assessing knowledge. © 2015 The Authors.},

The availability and types (e.g., free play or organized activities) of physical activity opportunities, their structure (e.g., presence of lines, elimination games), and staff behaviors (e.g., encouragement, engaged) can influence children’s MVPA. This study explored these factors in 20 ASPs serving over 1,700 elementary-age children. The occurrence, types, and structure of physical activity opportunities, and staff behaviors were collected via the SOSPAN (System for Observing Staff Promotion of Physical Activity and Nutrition). A total of 4,660 SOSPAN scans were completed across 63 complete program days (1,733 during physical activity opportunities). Physical activity opportunities were observed on 60 program days across all 20 sites, with 73% of those opportunities classified as free play. ASPs scheduled an average of 66.3 minutes (range 15-150 minutes) of physical activity opportunities daily. Games played included basketball, tag, soccer, and football. Staff rarely engaged in physical activity promotion behaviors, and the structure of organized games discouraged MVPA. For example, staff verbally promoted physical activity in just 6.1% of scans, while organized games were more likely to involve lines and elimination. Professional development training may enhance staffs’ physical activity promotion and the structure of activity opportunities. © 2015 Society for Public Health Education.},

	abstract = {This perspective article explores the utility of active video gaming as a means of reducing sedentary behavior and increasing physical activity among youth with physical disabilities and limitations in lower extremity function who typically are excluded from mainstream exercise options. Youth with physical disabilities are disproportionately affected by health problems that result from sedentary behavior, lack of physical activity, and low fitness levels. Physical, programmatic, and attitudinal barriers have a synergistic and compounded impact on youths' ability to participate in physical activity. A recent health and wellness task force recommendation from the American Physical Therapy Association's Section on Pediatrics supports analyzing individualized health behaviors and preferences that are designed to improve fitness, physical activity, and participation in pediatric rehabilitation. This recommendation represents an opportunity to explore nontraditional options to maximize effectiveness and sustainability of pediatric rehabilitation techniques for youth with disabilities who could best benefit from customized programming. One new frontier in promoting physical activity and addressing common physical activity barriers for youth with physical disabilities is active video games (AVGs), which have received growing attention as a promising strategy for promoting health and fitness in children with and without disabilities. The purpose of this article is to discuss the potential for AVGs as an accessible option to increase physical activity participation for youth with physical disabilities and limitations in lower extremity function. A conceptual model on the use of AVGs to increase physical activity participation for youth with physical disabilities is introduced, and future research potential is discussed, including a development project for game controller adaptations within the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Interactive Exercise Technologies and Exercise Physiology for People With Disabilities (RERC RecTech) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)/Lakeshore Foundation Research Collaborative. © 2016 American Physical Therapy Association.},

	abstract = {The overlap of gaming and gambling activities within online digital technologies is of growing relevance to the study of technological addictions. Social casino games are immensely popular ‘free to play’ games that offer realistic emulation of financial gambling activities. Their structural similarities might suggest that engagement in social casino games may be particularly risky for people with existing gambling problems. Currently it is not known whether social casino games are used problematically by individuals who also experience problematic gambling, the extent of this overlap, the characteristics of those who experience problems with both activities, and the symptoms of problematic social casino game use they experience. An online survey was administered to Internet users (N = 1554) to assess social casino game use and associated problems. This study examined a subsample of 176 adults who played social casino games and reported self-identified gambling problems. The results indicated that a greater frequency and diversity of social casino game playing and more frequent and larger expenditure on social casino games was significantly positively associated with symptom severity of problematic social casino game use. Gamblers who were younger, less educated, spoke a non-English language, and with higher psychological distress, were more likely to report greater problems. Playing social casino games to escape or relieve a negative mood was the most commonly reported symptom. These findings suggest that some problem gamblers may also be at risk of problematic engagement in online gambling activities that lack financial incentives. Gamblers' concurrent engagement in social casino games therefore warrants further consideration in gambling research studies and clinical practice settings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Objectives: A game application, "Making Smart Choices", was developed to fill the gap of limited easy-to-access resources available on sex education in Hong Kong and to disseminate correct knowledge and positive attitudes toward sex to teenagers using popular platforms such as tablets, Facebook, and the Web. Subjects and Methods: Three versions of the game (iPAD, Facebook, and Web-based) were developed using HTML5. A theoretical framework that involved game-based learning and participatory design approach was used to design, develop, modify, and optimize the game for use with secondary school students (n=1176) 12-16 years of age. Pre- and post-test scores of students' safer sex knowledge were compared to test the effectiveness of the game. Students' survey and interviews were analyzed to assess participant feelings and attitudes toward the game. Results: The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test indicated that students' sex knowledge (n=788) improved with a medium effect size (0.477) after playing the game. Increases in positive attitudes toward sex and relationship and in awareness of making smart sexual choices were reported from student surveys and interviews. Students described the game as "interesting," "interactive," "informative," and "real-to-life." Conclusions: We advocate that the participatory design approach, which supports collaborative efforts of different stakeholders, is an effective framework for developing game-based learning tools for sex education. Our work provides preliminary findings that suggest game-based learning, preferably delivered through popular interactive platforms, can be effective in promoting sex education to teenagers. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.},

	abstract = {Background: Obesity is a growing global issue that is linked to cognitive and psychological deficits. Objective: This preliminary study investigated the efficacy of training to improve inhibitory control (IC), a process linked to overeating, on consumption and cognitive control factors. Methods: This study utilized a multisession mobile phone-based intervention to train IC in an overweight and obese population using a randomized waitlist-control design. A combination of self-assessment questionnaires and psychophysiological measures was used to assess the efficacy of the intervention in terms of improved general IC and modified food consumption after training. Attitudes toward food were also assessed to determine their mediating role in food choices. A total of 58 participants (47 female) completed 2 assessment sessions 3 weeks apart, with 2 weeks of intervention training for the training group during this time. The groups did not differ in baseline demographics including age, body mass index, and inhibitory control. Results: Inhibitory control ability improved across the training sessions, with increases in P3 amplitude implying increased cognitive control over responses. Inhibitory control training was associated with increased healthy and reduced unhealthy food consumption in a taste test and in the week following training, as measured by the Healthy Eating Quiz and the food consumption test. Cognitive restraint was enhanced after training for the training but not the waitlist condition in the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, implying that attempts to avoid unhealthy foods in the future will be easier for the training group participants. Conclusions: Inhibitory control training delivered via a purpose-designed mobile phone app is easy to complete, is convenient, and can increase cognitive restraint and reduce unhealthy food consumption. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.

	abstract = {Background: Playing video games contributes substantially to sedentary behavior in youth. A new generation of video games-active games-seems to be a promising alternative to sedentary games to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior. At this time, little is known about correlates of active and non-active gaming among adolescents. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine potential personal, social, and game-related correlates of both active and non-active gaming in adolescents. Methods: A survey assessing game behavior and potential personal, social, and game-related correlates was conducted among adolescents (12-16 years, N=353) recruited via schools. Multivariable, multilevel logistic regression analyses, adjusted for demographics (age, sex and educational level of adolescents), were conducted to examine personal, social, and game-related correlates of active gaming ≥1 hour per week (h/wk) and non-active gaming >7 h/wk. Results: Active gaming ≥1 h/wk was significantly associated with a more positive attitude toward active gaming (OR 5.3, CI 2.4-11.8; P<.001), a less positive attitude toward non-active games (OR 0.30, CI 0.1-0.6; P=.002), a higher score on habit strength regarding gaming (OR 1.9, CI 1.2-3.2; P=.008) and having brothers/sisters (OR 6.7, CI 2.6-17.1; P<.001) and friends (OR 3.4, CI 1.4-8.4; P=.009) who spend more time on active gaming and a little bit lower score on game engagement (OR 0.95, CI 0.91-0.997; P=.04). Non-active gaming >7 h/wk was significantly associated with a more positive attitude toward non-active gaming (OR 2.6, CI 1.1-6.3; P=.035), a stronger habit regarding gaming (OR 3.0, CI 1.7-5.3; P<.001), having friends who spend more time on non-active gaming (OR 3.3, CI 1.46-7.53; P=.004), and a more positive image of a non-active gamer (OR 2, CI 1.07-3.75; P=.03). Conclusions: Various factors were significantly associated with active gaming ≥1 h/wk and non-active gaming >7 h/wk. Active gaming is most strongly (negatively) associated with attitude with respect to non-active games, followed by observed active game behavior of brothers and sisters and attitude with respect to active gaming (positive associations). On the other hand, non-active gaming is most strongly associated with observed non-active game behavior of friends, habit strength regarding gaming and attitude toward non-active gaming (positive associations). Habit strength was a correlate of both active and non-active gaming, indicating that both types of gaming are habitual behaviors. Although these results should be interpreted with caution because of the limitations of the study, they do provide preliminary insights into potential correlates of active and non-active gaming that can be used for further research as well as preliminary direction for the development of effective intervention strategies for replacing non-active gaming by active gaming among adolescents. © 2014 JMIR Publications Inc.

Qualitative research methods were used to identify the desired content and features of a mobile app for meeting and improving the healthcare needs of persons living with HIV (PLWH). We conducted six focus group sessions with 50 English-or Spanish-speaking PLWH in New York City. To inform data analysis and to illustrate how mHealth technology can be used as a persuasive strategy for improving the health of PLWH, we integrated Fogg’s functional role triad for computing technology model with the self-determination theory to illustrate how mHealth technology can be used as a persuasive strategy for improving the health of PLWH. Participants suggested several tools for meeting their healthcare needs, including: reminders/alerts, lab results tracking, and notes on health status. mHealth technology can function as a social actor by providing chat boxes/forums, testimonials of lived experiences, and personal outreach. Examples of media that can be used as a persuasive technology include games/virtual rewards, coding of health tasks, and simulations on how to connect with PLWH. Findings from these focus groups can be used to design a mobile app for PLWH that is targeted to meet their healthcare needs. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Anecdotal clinical reports indicate that mental health professionals are beginning to use information from their patients’ electronic activities in treatment and that their data-gathering practices have gone far beyond simply searching for patients online. Both academic and private sector researchers are developing mental health applications to collect patient information for clinical purposes. Professional societies and commentators have provided minimal guidance, however, about best practices for obtaining or using information fromelectronic communications or other online activities. This article reviews the clinical and ethical issues regarding use of patients’ electronic activities, primarily focusing on situations in which patients share information with clinicians voluntarily.We discuss the potential uses of mental health patients’ electronic footprints for therapeutic purposes, and consider both the potential benefits and the drawbacks and risks. Whether clinicians decide to use such information in treating any particular patient—and if so, the nature and scope of its use—requires case-by-case analysis. But it is reasonable to assume that clinicians, depending on their circumstances and goals, will encounter circumstances in which patients’ electronic activities will be relevant to, and useful in, treatment. © 2017 President and Fellows of Harvard College.},

Initially, 336 professionals had obtained the game 12–18 months earlier. In addition, twelve professionals were interviewed individually. Results showed that the actual use of SeCZ TaLK was associated with a positive attitude towards discussing sexuality, a high perceived feasibility of the game, own motivation and skills, and correspondence with work routines. The presence of preconditions (such as time to play and staffing capacity), participant’s recruitment for game sessions and the professional environment were non-significant factors. Professionals appreciated the board game SeCZ TaLK but actual use depended on own motivation and skills and correspondence with work routines. To enhance the use of the board game, management should prioritize discussing sexuality and support the professionals in developing relevant skills. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

In Study 1, we manipulated synchrony and exercise intensity among rowers and found that, compared with low intensity exercise, moderate intensity exercise led to significantly higher levels of cooperation in an economic game; no effect of synchrony vs. non-synchrony was found. In Study 2, we investigated the effects of bonding on performance, using synchrony as a cue of existing supportive social bonds among participants. An elite, highly bonded team of rugby players participated in solo, synchronized, and non-synchronized warm-up sessions; participants' anaerobic performance significantly improved after the brief synchronous warm-up relative to the non-synchronous warm-up. The findings substantiate claims concerning the reciprocal links between group exercise and social bonding, and may help to explain the ubiquity of collective physical activity across cultural domains as varied as play, ritual, sport, and dance. © 2015 Davis et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine parental attitudes regarding engagement with video games by their children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and whether attitudes vary based on ASD symptom severity. Method: Online survey methodology was used to gather information from parents of children with ASD between the ages of 8 and 12 years. The finalized data set included 152 cases. Descriptive statistics and frequency analyses were used to examine participant demographics and video game play. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to evaluate questions on the theory of planned behavior. Regression analyses determined the predictive ability of the theory of planned behavior constructs, and t tests provided additional descriptive information about between-group differences. Results: Children with ASD play video games. There are no significant differences in the time, intensity, or types of games played based on severity of ASD symptoms (mild vs. moderate). Parents of children with ASD had positive attitudes about video game play. Conclusions: Parents of children with ASD appear to support video game play. On average, parents indicated video game play was positive for their children with ASD, particularly if they believed the games were having a positive impact on their child’s development. © 2015 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.},

	abstract = {Objective Traditionally breastfeeding education programs target mothers solely. The objective of this study was to design and pilot test an interactive eHealth breastfeeding co-parenting resource developed to target both mothers and fathers. eHealth resources provide an accessible and engaging format on which to educate parents and assist them in meeting their breastfeeding goals. Best practices to design such resources are not currently known. Design A three phase pilot study was conducted. The three phases included conducting a needs assessment, creating the resource and pilot testing the resource with mother, father and health care professionals to determine their perspectives regarding the usability and design of the prototype resource. The interactive prototype resource was designed to provide information to parents on breastfeeding and co-parenting, which included suggestions on how fathers can be involved and support breastfeeding and how the couples can work as a team to meet their breastfeeding goals. Setting: Recruitment took place in a health region in Southern Ontario, Canada between June 2014 and March 2015. Online questionnaires were completed by participants in all phases of the study.Participants: Participants (n=149) were pregnant or new mothers and their partners in the health region who read and speak English and had access to the internet and health care professionals who work with breastfeeding families in Ontario, Canada. Intervention A prototype eHealth breastfeeding co-parenting resource was developed based on maternal and paternal feedback from Phase I and utilized an interactive interface which included games and multimodal information delivery. The prototype eHealth resource was provided to the parents in Phase II and health care professionals in Phase III. The final resource was created based on feedback from these participants. Measurements and Findings The resource was pilot tested with new and expectant parents using pre- and post-test questionnaires which included measures for breastfeeding self-efficacy (Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Short Form), infant feeding attitude (Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale), breastfeeding knowledge (Breastfeeding Knowledge Questionnaire) and co-parenting relationship (Co-parenting Relationship Scale). Maternal and paternal breastfeeding self-efficacy and knowledge and infant feeding attitude scores all increased from pre-test to post-test. However, there was no difference in the co-parenting relationship scores from pretest to post-test. Key Conclusions This study has used feedback from parents and health professionals to develop a prototype resource which appears to be effective in increasing parents’ breastfeeding knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy. The prototype resource was rated positively by parents and health care providers. Implications for Practice An eHealth breastfeeding co-parenting resource designed with input from the target population is an effective way of providing information to mothers and fathers. Further research with a randomized controlled design and more diverse populations is needed to determine effectiveness of the resource on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. © 2017},

The purpose of our study was to use the World Health Organization's Rapid Assessment and Response (RAR) method to design a community-based, cultural- and age-appropriate HIV prevention program for adolescents in Bangkok, Thailand. Adolescent single-gender-specific focus groups (n = 3; 28 participants) were used to gather reactions/ideas about program topics/approaches. An adult, mixed-gender group was held to review information identified by adolescents. Sessions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Themes regarding HIV content and the process of implementation emerged from a qualitative content analysis of the data. Community representatives recommended incorporation of HIV information and risk-prevention skills. Information delivery suggestions included small group discussions, interactive games/role-playing, program materials/terminology, and HIV-infected program facilitators. Community members provided critical input toward an HIV prevention program tailored to meet adolescents' unique needs/interests. The RAR model provides opportunities to engage communities in developing health-related interventions. © 2015 Association of Nurses in AIDS Care.},

	abstract = {Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for HIV, and alcohol use is a major risk factor for HIV infection. Internet-facilitated brief interventions have been shown to reduce alcohol use and HIV-risk behavior in other at-risk populations, but have so far incorporated limited content and have not been tested among MSM. Objective: This manuscript describes Game Plan, an interactive, tablet-optimized web application designed to help heavy drinking, high-risk MSM consider reducing their alcohol use and sexual risk behavior. In this paper, we discuss the rationale, goals, and flow for each of Game Plan's components, which were modelled after common in-person and web-based brief motivational interventions for these behaviors. Methods: The development of Game Plan was informed by a thorough user-focused design research process that included (1) audits of existing interventions, (2) focus groups with stakeholders and (3) intended users (high-risk, heavy drinking MSM), and (4) usability testing. The aesthetic, features, and content of the app were designed iteratively throughout this process Results: The fully-functional Game Plan app provides (1) specific and personal feedback to users about their level of risk, (2) exercises to help prompt users to reflect on whether their current behavior aligns with other important life goals and values, and for those open to change, (3) exercises to help users understand factors that contribute to risk, and (4) a change planning module. In general, this flow was constructed to roughly align with the two phases described in early accounts of motivational interviewing (MI): (1) Content intended to elicit intrinsic motivation for change, and when/if sufficient motivation is present, (2) content intended to translate that motivation into specific goals and plans for change. This sequence first focuses on the user's HIV risk behavior, followed by their alcohol use and the connection between the two. The app's overall aesthetic (eg, branding, color palettes, icons/graphics) and its onboarding sequence was also designed to align with the "spirit" of MI by conveying respect for autonomy, open-mindedness (ie, avoiding judgment), and empathy. Conclusions: Should future research support its efficacy in facilitating behavior change, Game Plan could represent a wide-reaching and scalable tool that is well-suited for use in settings where delivering evidence-based, in-person interventions would be difficult or cost-prohibitive. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

	abstract = {Background/Purpose: Adolescents from urban, socioeconomically disadvantaged communities of color encounter high rates of adverse childhood experiences. To address the resulting multidimensional problems, we developed an innovative approach, Experiential Participatory and Interactive Knowledge Elicitation (EPIKE), using remote experiential needs elicitation methods to generate design and content requirements for a mobile health (mHealth) psychoeducational intervention. Methods: At a community-based organization in a northeastern city, the research team developed EPIKE by incorporating elicitation of input on the graphics and conducting remotely recorded experiential meetings and iterative reviews of the design to produce an mHealth smartphone story application (app) prototype for the participants to critique. The 22 participants were 13- to 17-year-olds, predominantly African American and female, from underresourced communities. Results: The four goals of the design process were attained: 1) story development from participant input; 2) needs-elicitation that reflected the patient-centered care approach; 3) interactive story game creation that accommodates the participants’ emotional and cognitive developmental needs; 4) development of a game that adolescents can relate to and that which matches their comfort levels of emotional intensity. Conclusions: The EPIKE approach can be used successfully to identify the needs of adolescents across the digital divide to inform the design and development of mHealth apps. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Background: Prosocial behaviors are essential to the ability to relate to others. Women typically display greater prosocial behavior than men. The impact of depression on prosocial behaviors and how gender interacts with those effects are not fully understood. We explored the role of gender in the potential effects of depression on prosocial behavior. Methods: We examined prosocial behaviors using a modified version of the Trust Game in a clinical population and community controls. Study participants were characterized on the severity of depression and anxiety, presence of suicidal ideation, history of childhood trauma, recent stressful life events, and impulsivity. We correlated behavioral outcomes with gender and clinical variables using analysis of variance and multiple regression analysis. Results: The 89 participants comprised four study groups: depressed women, depressed men, healthy women and healthy men (n = 16-36). Depressed men exhibited reciprocity more frequently than healthy men. Depression induced an inversion of the gender-specific pattern of self-centered behavior. Suicidal ideation was associated with increased reciprocity behavior in both genders, and enhancement of the effect of depression on gender-specific self-centered behavior. Conclusions: Depression, particularly suicidal ideation, is associated with reversal of gender-specific patterns of prosocial behavior, suggesting abnormalities in sexual hormones regulation. This explanation is supported by known abnormalities in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axes found in depression. © 2014 Cáceda et al.},

	abstract = {Gamification is a relatively new trend that focuses on applying game mechanics to non-game contexts in order to engage audiences and to inject a little fun into mundane activities besides generating motivational and cognitive benefits. While many fields such as Business, Marketing and e-Learning have taken advantage of the potential of gamification, the digital healthcare domain has also started to exploit this emerging trend. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding gamified e-Health applications. A systematic literature review was therefore conducted to explore the various gamification strategies employed in e-Health and to address the benefits and the pitfalls of this emerging discipline. A total of 46 studies from multiple sources were then considered and thoroughly investigated. The results show that the majority of the papers selected reported gamification and serious gaming in health and wellness contexts related specifically to chronic disease rehabilitation, physical activity and mental health. Although gamification in e-Health has attracted a great deal of attention during the last few years, there is still a dearth of valid empirical evidence in this field. Moreover, most of the e-Health applications and serious games investigated have been proven to yield solely short-term engagement through extrinsic rewards. For gamification to reach its full potential, it is therefore necessary to build e-Health solutions on well-founded theories that exploit the core experience and psychological effects of game mechanics. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {A cost-effective and interactive way of promoting healthy nutrition behaviors among adolescents is using information and communication technologies (ICTs). We systematically reviewed studies to identify technologies and their main characteristics used for nutritional interventions for adolescents, as well as to evaluate their quality and effectiveness. Our full protocol is available on the PROSPERO website (#CRD42016035882). A search was conducted across five databases for articles describing nutritional interventions that used ICTs designed mainly for healthy adolescents. Randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental and observational studies, and full and original papers, all of them published from 2005 to 2015, were included. Study quality was assessed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool. Our search yielded 559 titles and abstracts. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Participants were recruited mostly from schools. Study followup ranged from two weeks to two years. Four interventions were based on the Social Cognitive Theory. Interventional strategies included computer games, programs, text messages, and interactive CD-ROMs. Nine studies used computer-mediated ICTs. Five studies focused on multiple behaviors simultaneously. Participants were exposed to interventions only once, daily, weekly, or according to a pre-determined number of lessons. Five studies had significant outcomes. Our quality assessment revealed three studies to be weak due to non-representativeness of their samples and usage of non-validated questionnaires. Besides the heterogeneity and poor quality of the analyzed studies, it can be suggested that long-term interventions for adolescents that make use of frequent exposure to technological resources, and that have a theoretical component aimed at a single health behavior change, tend to be more successful. © 2017 do Amaral e Melo et al.

	abstract = {For profoundly blind individuals, navigating in an unfamiliar building can represent a significant challenge. We investigated the use of an audio-based, virtual environment called Audio-based Environment Simulator (AbES) that can be explored for the purposes of learning the layout of an unfamiliar, complex indoor environment. Furthermore, we compared two modes of interaction with AbES. In one group, blind participants implicitly learned the layout of a target environment while playing an exploratory, goal-directed video game. By comparison, a second group was explicitly taught the same layout following a standard route and instructions provided by a sighted facilitator. As a control, a third group interacted with AbES while playing an exploratory, goal-directed video game however, the explored environment did not correspond to the target layout. Following interaction with AbES, a series of route navigation tasks were carried out in the virtual and physical building represented in the training environment to assess the transfer of acquired spatial information. We found that participants from both modes of interaction were able to transfer the spatial knowledge gained as indexed by their successful route navigation performance. This transfer was not apparent in the control participants. Most notably, the game-based learning strategy was also associated with enhanced performance when participants were required to find alternate routes and short cuts within the target building suggesting that a ludic-based training approach may provide for a more flexible mental representation of the environment. Furthermore, outcome comparisons between early and late blind individuals suggested that greater prior visual experience did not have a significant effect on overall navigation performance following training. Finally, performance did not appear to be associated with other factors of interest such as age, gender, and verbal memory recall. We conclude that the highly interactive and immersive exploration of the virtual environment greatly engages a blind user to develop skills akin to positive near transfer of learning. Learning through a game play strategy appears to confer certain behavioral advantages with respect to how spatial information is acquired and ultimately manipulated for navigation. © 2014 Connors, Chrastil, Sánchez and Merabet.},

	abstract = {Joint attention behaviors include initiating one's own and responding to another's bid for joint attention to an object, person, or topic. Joint attention abilities in autism are pervasively atypical, correlate with development of language and social abilities, and discriminate children with autism from other developmental disorders. Despite the importance of these behaviors, the neural correlates of joint attention in individuals with autism remain unclear. This paucity of data is likely due to the inherent challenge of acquiring data during a real-time social interaction. We used a novel experimental set-up in which participants engaged with an experimenter in an interactive face-to-face joint attention game during fMRI data acquisition. Both initiating and responding to joint attention behaviors were examined as well as a solo attention (SA) control condition. Participants included adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n = 13), a mean age- and sex-matched neurotypical group (n = 14), and a separate group of neurotypical adults (n = 22). Significant differences were found between groups within social-cognitive brain regions, including dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), during the RJA as compared to SA conditions. Region-of-interest analyses revealed a lack of signal differentiation between joint attention and control conditions within left pSTS and dMPFC in individuals with ASD. Within the pSTS, this lack of differentiation was characterized by reduced activation during joint attention and relative hyper-activation during SA. These findings suggest a possible failure of developmental neural specialization within the STS and dMPFC to joint attention in ASD. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Although sleep is a key element in adolescent development, teens are spending increasing amounts of time online with health risks related to excessive use of electronic media (computers, smartphones, tablets, consoles…) negatively associated with daytime functioning and sleep outcomes. Adolescent sleep becomes irregular, shortened and delayed in relation with later sleep onset and early waking time due to early school starting times on weekdays which results in rhythm desynchronization and sleep loss. In addition, exposure of adolescents to the numerous electronic devices prior to bedtime has become a great concern because LEDs emit much more blue light than white incandescent bulbs and compact fluorescent bulbs and have therefore a greater impact on the biological clock. A large number of adolescents move to evening chronotype and experience a misalignment between biological and social rhythms which, added to sleep loss, results in e.g. fatigue, daytime sleepiness, behavioral problems and poor academic achievement. This paper on adolescent circadian disruption will review the sensitivity of adolescents to light including LEDs with the effects on the circadian system, the crosstalk between the clock and the pineal gland, the role of melatonin, and the behavior of some adolescents (media use, alcohol consumption, binge drinking, smoking habits, stimulant use…). Lastly, some practical recommendations and perspectives are put forward. The permanent social jet lag resulting in clock misalignment experienced by a number of adolescents should be considered as a matter of public health. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a computer-based game to improve social skills and mental health in children with social skills deficits would be efficacious. The program, Adventures aboard the S.S. GRIN, translates a proven in-person intervention into a nine-episode interactive online adventure game that provides opportunity for knowledge acquisition and skill practice. Materials and Methods: Participants (children aged 7-11 years with social skills challenges) were randomly assigned to immediate treatment group (n = 33) or waitlist control group (n = 36). Children in the immediate treatment condition completed the game at home over the course of 9 weeks. Before playing the game and again within 1 week of game completion, children completed surveys about social literacy, social anxiety, bullying, social self-efficacy, and social satisfaction. Results: Children who played Adventures improved significantly more from pretest to posttest than children who did not play the game in social literacy, social anxiety, bullying victimization, and social satisfaction. Conclusion: Online interactive games can be effective in improving mental health for children who struggle with social skills. For children who can access them, serious games have the potential to increase the reach of effective programs by overcoming the logistical and implementation barriers (such as cost, travel, and accessibility) that limit traditionally delivered mental health interventions. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.},

One of such issues is the incidence of chronic diseases, which are responsible for a considerable proportion of worldwide mortality. It is possible to prevent the development of such diseases using tools and methods that instruct the population. To achieve this, mobile games provide a powerful environment for teaching different subjects to user, without them actively knowing that they are learning new concepts. Despite the growing interest of using mobile games in healthcare, more specifically by patients with chronic diseases, in the best of our knowledge there are no studies that address the current research being published in the area. To close this gap, we carried out a systematic mapping study to synthesize an overview of the area. Five databases were searched and more than 1200 studies were analyzed and filtered. Among them, 17 met the the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in this work. The results show that there is still room for research in this area, since the studies focus on a younger audience rather than proposing solutions for all ages. Furthermore, the number of chronic conditions being addressed is still small, obesity and diabetes are prevalent. Besides, the full capacity of game features that foster learning through games are not being employed, the majority of games proposed by the articles encompass less than half of these features. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Thirty-four users who did not own smartphones were given instrumented iPhones that logged all phone use over the course of the year-long study. At the conclusion of the study, users were asked to rate their level of addiction to the device. Sixty-two percent agreed or strongly agreed that they were addicted to their iPhones. These users showed differentiated smartphone use as compared to those users who did not indicate an addiction. Addicted users spent twice as much time on their phone and launched applications much more frequently (nearly twice as often) as compared to the non-addicted user. Mail, Messaging, Facebook and the Web drove this use. Surprisingly, Games did not show any difference between addicted and nonaddicted users. Addicted users showed significantly lower time-per-interaction than did non-addicted users for Mail, Facebook and Messaging applications. One addicted user reported that his addiction was problematic, and his use data was beyond three standard deviations from the upper hinge. The implications of the relationship between the logged and self-report data are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Despite many positive benefits, mobile phone use can be associated with harmful and detrimental behaviors. The aim of this study was twofold: to examine (a) cross-cultural patterns of perceived dependence on mobile phones in ten European countries, first, grouped in four different regions (North: Finland and UK; South: Spain and Italy; East: Hungary and Poland; West: France, Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland), and second by country, and (b) how socio-demographics, geographic differences, mobile phone usage patterns, and associated activities predicted this perceived dependence. Methods: A sample of 2,775 young adults (aged 18-29 years) were recruited in different European Universities who participated in an online survey. Measures included socio-demographic variables, patterns of mobile phone use, and the dependence subscale of a short version of the Problematic Mobile Phone Use Questionnaire (PMPUQ; Billieux, Van der Linden, & Rochat, 2008). Results: The young adults from the Northern and Southern regions reported the heaviest use of mobile phones, whereas perceived dependence was less prevalent in the Eastern region. However, the proportion of highly dependent mobile phone users was more elevated in Belgium, UK, and France. Regression analysis identified several risk factors for increased scores on the PMPUQ dependence subscale, namely using mobile phones daily, being female, engaging in social networking, playing video games, shopping and viewing TV shows through the Internet, chatting and messaging, and using mobile phones for downloading-related activities. Discussion and conclusions: Self-reported dependence on mobile phone use is influenced by frequency and specific application usage. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective This research focuses on the potential ability of animated avatars (a digital representation of the user) and virtual agents (a digital representation of a coach, buddy, or teacher) to deliver computer-based interventions for adolescents' chronic weight management. An exploration of the acceptance and desire of teens to interact with avatars and virtual agents for self-management and behavioral modification was undertaken. Materials and Methods The utilized approach was inspired by community-based participatory research. Data was collected from 2 phases: Phase 1) focus groups with teens, provider interviews, parent interviews; and Phase 2) mid-range prototype assessment by teens and providers. Results Data from all stakeholder groups expressed great interest in avatars and virtual agents assisting self-management efforts. Adolescents felt the avatars and virtual agents could: 1) reinforce guidance and support, 2) fit within their lifestyle, and 3) help set future goals, particularly after witnessing the effect of their current behavior(s) on the projected physical appearance (external and internal organs) of avatars. Teens wanted 2 virtual characters: A virtual agent to act as a coach or teacher and an avatar (extension of themselves) to serve as a "buddy" for empathic support and guidance and as a surrogate for rewards. Preferred modalities for use include both mobile devices to accommodate access and desktop to accommodate preferences for maximum screen real estate to support virtualization of functions that are more contemplative and complex (e.g., goal setting). Adolescents expressed a desire for limited co-user access, which they could regulate. Data revealed certain barriers and facilitators that could affect adoption and use. Discussion The current study extends the support of teens, parents, and providers for adding avatars or virtual agents to traditional computerbased interactions. Data supports the desire for a personal relationship with a virtual character in support of previous studies. The study provides a foundation for further work in the area of avatar-driven motivational interviewing. Conclusions This study provides evidence supporting the use of avatars and virtual agents, designed using participatory approaches, to be included in the continuum of care. Increased probability of engagement and long-term retention of overweight, obese adolescent users and suggests expanding current chronic care models toward more comprehensive, socio-technical representations. © The Author 2015.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) causes genital herpes, one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the U.S. HSV-1, commonly associated with cold sores, is increasing as a cause of genital herpes. Abstinence-only sexual health classes, commonly taught in Virginia, generate young adults who are under-educated in sexual health, increasing STI risks. College students in southwest Virginia were surveyed to assess comprehensiveness of high school health education regarding HSV-1 and HSV-2 and to identify students' preferred methods for STI education. Methods: To obtain data on knowledge of HSV, comprehensiveness of sexual health education in high school, and preferred learning methods, 237 college students participated in an online questionnaire and 28 students were interviewed using structured interviews. Results: Questionnaire and interview data indicated that Family Life Education classes need to include more comprehensive information on prevention, viral transmission, and differences between HSV-1 and HSV-2. The majority of total respondents (both the questionnaire and interview) (65%) reported non-comprehensive high school sexual health education. The majority of interview (79%) and questionnaire (55%) respondents wished they had learned more about herpes and other STIs in high school. Education preferences of both interviewed and surveyed respondents included interactive internet programs or games, more realistic lectures, and learning about STIs later in high school when students reported greater sexual activity. Conclusion: Our results indicate that more comprehensive sexual health education is needed and wanted by students in southwest Virginia. More relevant educational programs should be implemented for VA high school students utilizing technology and interactive methods to improve student engagement in sexual health education. Implications and contribution: These studies provide information on knowledge of herpes simplex viruses among college students, comprehensiveness of sexual health education received in high schools, and preferred methods to learn about HSV and other STIs. These studies inform the facilitation of improved health education practices and programs for high school and college students. © 2017 Hover, Bertke.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an important contributor to the cancer burden among Alaska Native people. CRC is the leading incident cancer and the second leading cause of cancer mortality among Alaska Native people. Completing recommended CRC screening procedures has the potential to reduce both CRC incidence and mortality. “Taking Action Colorectal Health,” a multidimensional audiovisual, interactive CD-ROM, incorporates adult education learning principles to provide Alaska's Community Health Aides/Practitioners with timely, medically accurate, and culturally relevant CRC place-based education. Providing this resource on CD-ROM empowers learning within communities and places where people live or choose to learn. The dynamic process of developing, implementing, and evaluating this CRC CD-ROM was informed by a sociocultural approach to share health messages. Within this approach, cultural values, beliefs, and behaviors are affirmed as a place of wisdom and resilience and built upon to provide context and meaning for health messaging. Alaska Native values that honor family, relationships, the land, storytelling, and humor were included in CD-ROM content. Between January and May 2012, 20 interviews were conducted with individuals who had used the CD-ROM. Four categorical themes emerged from analysis of interview transcripts: likeability, utilization, helpfulness, and behavior change. As a result of self-paced learning through stories, movies, and interactive games, respondents reported healthy behavior changes they were making for themselves, with their families and in their patient care practices. This CD-ROM is a culturally based practical course that increased knowledge and activities around colorectal cancer screening by Community Health Aides/Practitioners in Alaska. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Background: Having electronic media in the bedroom is cross-sectionally associated with greater screen-time in children, but few longitudinal studies exist. The aim of this study was to describe longitudinal patterns of ownership and examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of bedroom media with children's sedentary behaviour. Methods: Data are from the Sport, Physical activity and Eating behaviour: Environmental Determinants in Young people (SPEEDY) study, collected at 3 time-points: baseline (2007, T0; age 10.3 ± 0.3 years), 1-year (T1y) and 4-year (T4y) follow-up. For each assessment, 1512 (44.9% male), 715 (41.0% male), and 319 (48.3% male) participants provided valid accelerometer data. Outcome variables were accelerometer-assessed sedentary time and self-reported screen-time. The presence of a television or computer in the bedroom was self-reported by participants and a combined bedroom media score calculated as the sum of such items. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between bedroom media and each outcome were examined using multi-level linear regression. Results: Bedroom TV ownership fell from 70.9% at T0 to 42.5% at T4y. Having a TV in the bedroom (beta; 95% CI*100, T0: -1.17; -1.88, -0.46. T1y: -1.68; -2.67, -0.70) and combined bedroom media (T0: -0.76; -1.26, -0.27. T1y: -0.79; -1.51, -0.07) were negatively associated with objectively measured weekly sedentary time at T0 and T1y. Having a computer in the bedroom (beta; 95% CI, T0: 0.15; 0.02, 0.29. T4y: 0.35; 0.10, 0.60) and combined bedroom media (T0: 0.09: 0.01, 0.18. T4y: 0.20; 0.05, 0.34) were positively associated with screen-time at T0 and T4y. Relative to participants without a computer throughout the study, children that had a computer in their bedroom at T0 but not at T4y (beta; 95% CI for change in screen-time: -8.02; -12.75, -3.29) reported smaller increases in screen-time.Conclusions: The bedroom media environment changes with age and exhibits a complex relationship with children's sedentary behaviour.

	abstract = {Objective: Serious games are emerging as important tools that offer an innovative approach to teach adolescents behavioral skills to avoid risky situations. PlayForward: Elm City Stories, an interactive videogame targeting risk reduction, is currently undergoing evaluation. Collecting stakeholder data on its acceptability and real-life implementation strategies is critical for successful dissemination. Materials and Methods: We collected interview data from four stakeholder groups regarding incorporating PlayForward into settings with adolescents. Transcripts were coded, creating a comprehensive code structure for each stakeholder group. Results: We conducted 40 semi-structured interviews that included 14 adolescents (aged 12-15 years; 10 boys), eight parents/guardians (all women), 12 after-school/school coordinators (nine women), and 14 community partners (13 women). We identified four themes that reflected stakeholders' perceptions about how the videogame might be implemented in real-world settings. (1) Stakeholder groups expressed that the topics of sex, alcohol, and drugs were not being taught in an educational setting. (2) Stakeholder groups saw a videogame as a viable option to teach about sex, alcohol, and drugs. (3) Stakeholder groups thought that the videogame would fit well into other settings, such as after-school programs or community organizations. (4) Some stakeholder groups highlighted additional tools that could help with implementation, such as manuals, homework assignments, and group discussion questions. Conclusion: Stakeholder groups supported the game as a delivery vehicle for targeted content, indicating high acceptability but highlighting additional tools that would aid in implementation. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.},

	abstract = {Background: Exergaming is potentially useful to promote physical activity in children; however, long-term effectiveness is unclear. MobileKids Monster Manor (MKMM) is a mobile exergame developed with the help of young advisors. The game wirelessly transmits physical activity data from an accelerometer to a mobile device. Players' steps are redeemed for in-game rewards, for example, new characters. Objective: First, to evaluate whether increased physical activity previously observed in a 1-week intervention is sustained over a 2-week intervention and 1-week follow-up, and second, to compare impact in schools within different socioeconomic environments. Methods: Thirty-seven elementary school students participated in a 4-week randomized controlled study (1-week baseline; 2-week intervention [with only the Game group receiving MKMM]; and 1-week follow-up). All participants wore a Tractivity® accelerometer throughout. Linear mixed models were applied to assess sustainability; a second 42-children-based dataset and age-/sex-adjusted linear regression models were used to compare effect across socioeconomic environments. Results: In the first week of intervention, the Game group compared to the Control group showed a greater increase in physical activity (of 1,758 steps/day [95% confidence interval, CI = 133-3,385] and 31 active minutes/day [95% CI = 4-59]), relative to baseline (13,986 steps/day; 231 active minutes/day). However, this was not sustained in the second intervention week or follow-up. The school within a lower socioeconomic status environment showed lower baseline activity and the 1-week intervention resulted in a greater increase relative to baseline (3,633 steps/day more [95% CI = 1,281-5,985]). Conclusion: MKMM could be a useful short-term physical activity promotion tool; however, effectiveness may decrease as novelty diminishes. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.},

	abstract = {Predictability of dangerousness in association with mental disorders remains elusive, outside of a few relatively well-established risk factors for the prognostication of violence, such as male sex, the presence of a psychotic disorder, and comorbid substance abuse. In clinical practice, inquiry into the presence of aggressive or violent ideation, in the form of ideas of homicide or suicide, is part of a standard mental status examination. Nonetheless, fantasy life, when it concerns harm toward others, may not be as reliable an indicator of imminent danger as it may be in the case of self-harm. Five cases of young Italian men with Asperger syndrome and recurrent and extremely violent femicide fantasies are presented. While there is no direct correlation between autism spectrum conditions and violence, as other humans, persons with an autistic condition are capable of committing crimes, including homicide. All five had in common a number of characteristics and behaviors felt to be pathoplastic: All had been bullied, all had been romantically rejected, all were long-standing First Person Shooter (FPS) game players, and all were avid violent pornography consumers. The potential for an actual neurocognitive impact of violent video games, well documented in the literature, and its combination with personal life history and chronic habituation following long-standing violent pornography use is discussed in the context of social and emotional vulnerabilities. While aggressive fantasies cannot and should not be underestimated, in countries where duty to protect legislation does not exist, a clinical approach is imperative, as, incidentally, should be anywhere. © The Author(s) 2015.},

	abstract = {Abstract: This paper describes the development and evaluation of an interactive, narrative-based, multimedia game to promote learning and communication about sexual violence and health topics. High school-aged participants created the game concept in a three-week workshop, after which assets were assembled and refined by a university-based game design lab. The outcome, Lucidity, was a multimedia game with a nonlinear narrative that led to two different outcomes based on player decisions. The narrative followed the life of one character, an African American woman named Zaria who remembers and grapples with a sexual assault from her past. The player discovers parts of the story by reading comics, watching videos, navigating interactive websites and playing short videogames. The final evaluation consisted of gameplay, a post-game focus group and follow-up interviews. Twenty-four young people participated in three focus group discussions (n = 9, n = 5, n = 10); 23 participated in the follow-up interviews. Salient themes identified in the focus group discussions included: overall approval of the game, the acquisition of new knowledge and minimal past exposure to conversations or education about sexual violence. At follow-up, almost all (n = 22) had initiated a conversation about sexual violence with a parent, peer and/or teacher. Lucidity succeeded in engaging young people and facilitating communication with adults and peers regarding sexual violence and other sexual health topics. Ultimately, a game-based intervention such as this represents a feasible approach for introducing issues of sexual violence, with potential for future implementation in educational settings. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Weight loss apps enable users to quantify many aspects of food consumption, beginning with calories intake. Users of weight loss apps can also participate in online forums that act as digital self-help groups. These apps also include several features related to game playing or gamification such as avatars, points and virtual awards. Gamification has the aim of strengthening motivation to carry out a (boring) task. We downloaded the 20 most popular free weight loss apps in Google Play. We analysed app descriptions provided by developers, comments about the selected apps in online forums and user reviews. We focused on four of these apps, since they had some special functions. We found that users’ risk management was based on a mixed method that combined quantification and gamification, that is, rationality and emotions. Quantification, which includes self-tracking, data analysis and graphic layout, provides the ‘rational’ basis for dietary regimes, while gamification provides the emotional support needed to maintain motivation and continue with the diet. Our analysis provides support for the emotion–risk assemblage theory and the in-between strategy. Our analysis reinforces the importance of emotions in risk management. However, these dieting apps are based on a reductionist approach to obesity and weight loss, as obesity is framed as an individual problem, while weight loss is seen as dependent on individual motivation. Such framing tends to conceal the social determinant of health and the social and political causes of obesity. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {The increased popularity of social media and mobile gaming among young adults provides an opportunity for innovative nutrition programs. This review evaluated the efficacy of these strategies in interventions targeted at 18- to 35-year-olds. The protocol was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Ten scientific databases, information technology conference proceedings, and gray literature were searched. Two reviewers conducted screening, data extraction, and quality assessments. Interventions were included if they used social media or electronic games. Comparisons were made pre- to post-intervention, or between intervention and control arms. Outcomes of interest included change in nutrition knowledge, attitudes, behavior, or weight and/or body composition. Eleven social media−based (randomized controlled trials [RCT] n=7) and six game-based [RCT n=1]) interventions were included. Overall quality of studies was low. Social media−based strategies included forum/blogs (n=5), Facebook (n=5), Twitter (n=1), YouTube (n=1), and chat rooms (n=1). Eight (RCT n=6) of 11 social media−based studies demonstrated improvements in outcomes. Findings suggested that social media may be more effective when combined with other strategies. Virtual reality games (n=3), web-based games (n=2), and a mobile application (n=1) were used in the gaming interventions. While a significant increase in knowledge was reported by three gaming studies (RCT=1), two used nonvalidated tools and longer-term measures of weight and behavioral outcomes were limited. The use of social media and gaming for nutrition promotion is in its infancy. Preliminary evidence suggests that these strategies have some utility for intervening with young adults. Further research using high-quality study designs is required, with measurement of outcomes over longer time periods.

	abstract = {Rewards are commonly used in interventions to change behavior, but they can inhibit development of intrinsic motivation, which is associated with long-term behavior maintenance. Gamification is a novel intervention strategy that may target intrinsic motivation through fun and enjoyment. Before the effects of gamified interventions on motivation can be determined, there must be an understanding of how gamified interventions operationalize rewards, such as point systems. The purpose of this review is to determine the prevalence of different reward types, specifically point systems, within gamified interventions. Electronic databases were searched for relevant articles. Data sources included Medline OVID, Medline PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, and PsycINFO. Out of the 21 articles retrieved, 18 studies described a reward system and were included in this review. Gamified interventions were designed to target a myriad of clinical outcomes across diverse populations. Rewards included points (n = 14), achievements/badges/medals (n = 7), tangible rewards (n = 7), currency (n = 4), other unspecified rewards (n = 3), likes (n = 2), animated feedback (n = 1), and kudos (n = 1). Rewards, and points in particular, appear to be a foundational component of gamified interventions. Despite their prevalence, authors seldom described the use of noncontingent rewards or how the rewards interacted with other game features. The reward systems relying on tangible rewards and currency may have been limited by inhibited intrinsic motivation. As gamification proliferates, future research should explicitly describe how rewards were operationalized in the intervention and evaluate the effects of gamified rewards on motivation across populations and research outcomes. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.},

The purpose of this study was to develop, implement and assess a concussion education programme. More precisely, four interactive oral presentations were delivered to high school student-athletes (N = 35, Mage = 15.94, SD = 0.34) in a large urban centre. Participants completed a questionnaire at three time-points during the season to measure changes in their knowledge (CK) and attitudes (CA) of concussions, and focus group interviews were conducted following the concussion education programme. Questionnaire data revealed participants’ post-intervention CK scores were higher than their pre-intervention scores. During the focus groups, the student-athletes said they acquired CK about the role of protective equipment and symptom variability, and in terms of CA, they intended to avoid dangerous in-game collisions in the future. Our study was the first to create and deliver a concussion education intervention across multiple time-points, and to use mixed-methods in its assessment. These findings may be of interest to researchers, practitioners and stakeholders in sport who are invested in making the sport environment safer through concussion education and awareness. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The effectiveness and acceptance of the game were evaluated by more than 1000 grades 7-9 students from six schools. The results showed that after playing the game, students' sex knowledge improved with a medium effect size.

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine and compare the correlates of objective sedentary behavior (SB) and nonschool self-reported SB in adolescents from 2 midsized cities, 1 in France (Tarbes) and 1 in Spain (Huesca). Stability of objective SB and nonschool self-reported SB were also assessed at different time points during 1 academic year. Method: Starting with a total of 829 participants and after applying inclusion criteria, objective SB was assessed for 646 adolescents (Mage = 14.30 ± 0.71 years) with GT3X accelerometers for 7 days at 2 time points. Nonschool self-reported SB was measured for 781 adolescents (Mage = 14.46 ± 0.76 years) at 3 time points by means of a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Results: Gender and ambient temperature emerged as the main statistically significant correlates in all objective SB models, showing higher objective SB levels in girls and lower objective SB levels when ambient temperature was higher. According to nonschool self-reported SB, a gender effect was found in almost all behaviors. Whereas boys spent more time playing with video games as well as games on their mobile phones, girls spent more time studying and using their computers and mobile phones to communicate with each other. The findings showed a statistically significant city effect on study time (Huesca > Tarbes) and video games and telephone communication time (Tarbes > Huesca). Conclusion: Nonschool self-reported SB patterns were different in Huesca and Tarbes. Intervention programs should be adapted to target the reduction of adolescents' SB according to different contexts. © 2015 Copyright © SHAPE America.},

	abstract = {Objective: Increased prevalence and penetration of cellphone and mobile Internet use have raised significant concerns about children's health and safety by offering new spaces for cyberbullying, harassment, and sexual misconduct. "Cyberhero Mobile Safety" is a videogame-based education program designed using tenets of the capacity model with the goal of instilling the knowledge and skills necessary to safely and productively navigate the mobile online environment. This study evaluates its usability, appeal, and perceived impact and usefulness. Materials and Methods: Six educational videogames were part of a program delivered to 3rd-6th grade students (n=108) across six public schools in Upstate NY. Videogame play was electronically captured to evaluate usability. Likeability, acceptability, and perceived usefulness of videogame content were evaluated through postgame questionnaires. Results: Videogame usability criteria were achieved on 82.7 percent of the students' gameplays. On a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high), mean ratings were 4.09 (standard deviation [SD]=1.28) for likeability, 3.54 (SD=1.61) for acceptability, and 4.16 (SD=1.33) for perceived message usefulness. Conclusions: The "Cyberhero Mobile Safety" program is a feasible and potentially effective platform for delivering information about safe and healthy cellphone and Internet use to children. Results support the use of the capacity model to design educational videogames because games that aligned with theory principles were reported as having the most impact and being the most useful at shifting children's online behaviors. Future research should directly test the individual components of the capacity model to inform educational game design. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.},

	abstract = {Electronic games (e-games) are widely used by children, often for substantial durations, yet to date there are no evidence-based guidelines regarding their use. The aim of this paper is to present guidelines for the wise use of e-games by children based on a narrative review of the research. This paper proposes a model of factors that influence child-e-games interaction. It summarises the evidence on positive and negative effects of use of e-games on physical activity and sedentary behaviour, cardio-metabolic health, musculoskeletal health, motor coordination, vision, cognitive development and psychosocial health. Available guidelines and the role of guidelines are discussed. Finally, this information is compiled into a clear set of evidence-based guidelines, about wise use of e-games by children, targeting children, parents, professionals and the e-game industry. These guidelines provide an accessible synthesis of available knowledge and pragmatic guidelines based on e-game specific evidence and related research. Practitioner Summary: E-games are an important part of life for many children. Evidence suggests they impact on many aspects of children's behaviour, health and development, though many issues lack convincing evidence. These evidence-based guidelines provide an accessible synthesis of available knowledge and pragmatic guidelines based on e-game specific evidence and related research. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Nurses caring for children with indwelling central venous catheters in 3 high-risk units were eligible to participate. All other units served as controls. The intervention was a 12-month nonrandomized quality improvement study of CLABSI App implementation with interunit competitions. Compared to the preceding year, the intervention group (9886 line days) CLABSI rate decreased by 48% (P =.03). Controls (7879 line days) did not change significantly. In all, 105 unique intervention group nurses completed 673 self-assessments. Competitions were associated with increased engagement as measured by self-assessments and unique participants.

	abstract = {“Internet Gaming Disorder” (IGD) was included as a “Condition for Further Study” in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Frequent gamers have previously been shown to exhibit core symptoms of addiction, along with significant impairments in psychosocial functioning. However, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the conceptualization and assessment of video game addiction. We examined the utility of nine questions (Cronbach's α = 0.64), based directly on proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for IGD, in capturing problems related to excess use of online video games. Regular video game users (n = 257) completed an online questionnaire assessing demographics, symptoms of IGD, general psychopathology, life satisfaction, self-esteem, and impulsivity. Participants meeting criteria for IGD (8.7%, n = 21) played video games significantly more often (p = 0.04) and for more hours at a time (p = 0.002), and experienced significantly greater subjective urges to use video games (p < 0.001). Furthermore, those with IGD endorsed significantly more symptoms of depression (p < 0.001), anxiety (p < 0.001), and stress (p = 0.01), lower life satisfaction (p < 0.001), and elevated motor (p = 0.02) and attentional impulsivity (p = 0.01). Proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for IGD appear to capture a clinically meaningful cluster of symptoms that is associated with marked impairments in multiple aspects of psychosocial functioning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Offering information and cues to action through a serious videogame for preteens may foster HPV vaccination awareness, information seeking, and communication. Materials and Methods: An iterative process was used to develop an interactive videogame, Land of Secret Gardens. Three focus groups were conducted with 16 boys and girls, ages 11-12, for input on game design, acceptability, and functioning. Two parallel focus groups explored parents' (n = 9) perspectives on the game concept. Three researchers identified key themes. Results: Preteens wanted a game that is both entertaining and instructional. Some parents were skeptical that games could be motivational. A back-story about a secret garden was developed as a metaphor for a preteen's body and keeping it healthy. The goal is to plant a lush secret garden and protect the seedlings by treating them with a potion when they sprout to keep them healthy as they mature. Points to buy seeds and create the potion are earned by playing mini-games. Throughout play, players are exposed to messaging about HPV and the benefits of the vaccine. Both boys and girls liked the garden concept and getting facts about HPV. Parents were encouraged to discuss the game with their preteens. Conclusion: Within a larger communication strategy, serious games could be useful for engaging preteens in health decision making about HPV vaccination. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.},

	abstract = {Background: Heart failure is the most common cause of hospital readmissions among Medicare beneficiaries and these hospitalizations are often driven by exacerbations in common heart failure symptoms. Patient collaboration with health care providers and decision making is a core component of increasing symptom monitoring and decreasing hospital use. Mobile phone apps offer a potentially cost-effective solution for symptom monitoring and self-care management at the point of need. Objective: The purpose of this review of commercially available apps was to identify and assess the functionalities of patient-facing mobile health apps targeted toward supporting heart failure symptom monitoring and self-care management. Methods: We searched 3 Web-based mobile app stores using multiple terms and combinations (eg, "heart failure,""cardiology,""heart failure and self-management"). Apps meeting inclusion criteria were evaluated using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS), IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics functionality scores, and Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) guidelines for nonpharmacologic management. Apps were downloaded and assessed independently by 2-4 reviewers, interclass correlations between reviewers were calculated, and consensus was met by discussion. Results: Of 3636 potentially relevant apps searched, 34 met inclusion criteria. Most apps were excluded because they were unrelated to heart failure, not in English or Spanish, or were games. Interrater reliability between reviewers was high. AskMD app had the highest average MARS total (4.9/5). More than half of the apps (23/34, 68%) had acceptable MARS scores (>3.0). Heart Failure Health Storylines (4.6) and AskMD (4.5) had the highest scores for behavior change. Factoring MARS, functionality, and HFSA guideline scores, the highest performing apps included Heart Failure Health Storylines, Symple, ContinuousCare Health App, WebMD, and AskMD. Peer-reviewed publications were identified for only 3 of the 34 apps. Conclusions: This review suggests that few apps meet prespecified criteria for quality, content, or functionality, highlighting the need for further refinement and mapping to evidence-based guidelines and room for overall quality improvement in heart failure symptom monitoring and self-care related apps. © Ruth M.

	abstract = {Despite relatively equal participation rates between females and males in casual gaming, females often report stigmatisation and prejudice towards their gaming competency within this sub-domain. Applying the theoretical framework of “stereotype threat”, this research examined the influence of explicit stereotype priming on females' casual gameplay performance and related attitudes. It also investigated whether the gender of the game avatar heightens susceptibility to stereotype threat. One hundred and twenty females were allocated randomly to one of four experimental conditions in a 2 (Condition: Stereotype threat, Control) x 2 (Avatar gender: Feminine, Masculine) between-subjects design. They completed a short gaming task and measures of social identity, competence beliefs, gameplay self-efficacy and self-esteem. Findings indicate that priming explicitly a negative gender-related stereotype did not appear to have a significant detrimental impact on gameplay performance or gameplay-related attitudes. Additionally, gameplay performance was not affected significantly by manipulating the gender of the gaming avatar. These findings suggest that, although females appear to be knowledgeable about negative gender-gaming stereotypes, these might not impact performance. Moreover, females tend not to endorse these beliefs as a true reflection of their gaming ability, representing a positive finding in view of the prevailing negative attitudes they face in gaming domains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Objective: Given that many households in western countries nowadays have home access to the Internet, developing health-promoting online interventions has the potential to reach large audiences. Studies assessing usage data of online health interventions are important and relevant but, as of yet, scarce. The present study reviewed usage data from Monkey Do, an existing online health game developed specifically for children from 4 to 8 years old. In addition, the effect of advertising on usage was examined. Materials and Methods: In an observational study, a web-based analysis program was used to examine usage data of all visits to the online health game for the first 31 months following the launch. We reported descriptives for usage data. We analyzed the relationship between advertising and usage with a Mann-Whitney U test, and used a Pearson's chi-square test to investigate the association between advertising and the number of first-time visitors. Results: In the period of data analysis, there were 224,859 sessions. Around 34% of the visitors played the game more than once. Compared with first-time visitors, the average session time of returning visitors was doubled. The game was most frequently accessed via search engine query, on a desktop computer (compared to mobile devices). Advertising was found to be positively related to the number of sessions and the number of first-time visitors. Conclusions: Placing a game online can reach a large audience, but it is important to also consider how to stimulate retention. Furthermore, repeated advertisement for an online game appears to be necessary to maintain visitors over time. Copyright © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTI ON: New-age technologies are ubiquitous in the lives of adolescents. Recent trends in media use suggest that adolescents are spending more time than ever engaging with technologies, and are able to do so in virtually all settings at any time. Given that new-age technologies are so heavily integrated within the daily life of adolescents, the health risks and benefits they offer must be closely examined. EVIDENCEACQUISITI ON: In this systematic review, we present recent literature related to the implications of new-age technologies on adolescent health. A total of 94 articles published since 2006 were collected using PubMed and Google Scholar on the most popular new-age technologies among adolescents: the internet, television, cell phones, and video games. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The current body of research highlights several health risks related to these technologies. Nearly all have the potential for addiction, which can result in other symptoms and impair one's daily life. Excessive use can affect several components of health, such as quality of sleep, body composition, and mental well-being, and certain practices (viewing pornography, sexting) can lead to risky sexual behaviors. However, the technologies discussed in the present review also have tremendous potential to promote adolescent health. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians must educate parents and patients on how to safely use technology to minimize the potentially harmful outcomes.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the present multi-disciplinary study was to inform toy and game designers about the presence and degree of competitive play in children with moderate intellectual disability (ID), as a function of their mental age. Toy design industry, especially in developing nations like India, has not looked at children with special needs as a target sector and thus there is a need to address the absence of theoretical understanding about the play behavior of these children and convert it into practical implications in design of playing aids. Considering competitive play in childhood plays a significant role in the social and moral development of the children, it becomes important to understand the nature of competitive play for children with ID. The present study is an attempt to study the emergence and degree of competitive play in children having moderate ID in India through a pilot experimental study involving children (N = 8) divided into four age groups of mental age 2–4, 4–6, 6–8 and 8–10 years as they respond to a situation of building blocks play when controlled competition is introduced explicitly through a facilitator. The results based on a qualitative analysis show that competition emerges after the mental age of around 4 years, however a negative correlation between relative degree of competition with mental age was seen unlike typical children [1]. Also, children in age-group of 2–4 years exhibited self-initiated cooperation. The findings are argued using relevant research literature from a sociological perspective and design recommendations are made like incorporating cooperative strategies and replacing competition in design of play activities. The standard group goals in activities need to be made flexible and customized and process should allow incremental outcomes to account for variation in the abilities of the children. Study also touches on the need for balanced facilitation in play activities and pedagogical interventions that allows children with free play opportunities. © Springer India 2015.},

	abstract = {Objective: Comprehensive sex education programs specifically designed for adolescents and young adults that take into account gender norms and cultural background have shown promise as a means of countering the high sexually transmitted infection rate in young people. Recently, digital gaming interventions delivered on computers or mobile devices have emerged as another way to promote safer sex behavior in a young population. Tailorin these computer-based interventions to their target population has been recognized to increase positive behavior outcomes. In this qualitative study, we investigated whether young female and male adults from two different cultural backgrounds (all living in Germany) would have different preferences and needs in relation to an educational game promoting safer sex. Materials and Methods: We conducted four semistructured focus group interviews comprising open-ended questions with male and female participants who had either a German or a Turkish background. In total, 20 individuals, aged between 18 and 22 years, from two socially diverse and ethnically mixed vocational schools in Germany participated. Results: Independent of cultural background and gender, participants preferred a real-world design with a first-person visual perspective over a fantasy-like third-person perspective. Furthermore, they preferred highly customizable avatars. All participants mentioned the importance of including an alcohol-intoxicated avatar and most participants wanted there to be additional information available about various safer sex approaches and about the use of different barrier protection methods. Males and females reported similar preferences for the design of an educational game promoting safer sex, with the only difference being exactly how the topic of having sexual intercourse should be addressed in the game. Males preferred a direct approach, whereas females had a preference for treating this subject more sympathetically. Conclusion: Educational games offer anonymity and can provide young people across different cultural backgrounds with gender-tailored opportunities to experiment with specific safer sex precautions in a nonthreatening virtual environment, free from unwanted parental control and peer monitoring. © 2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: In the United States, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disproportionately affects young men who have sex with men (YMSM). For HIV-positive individuals, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical for achieving optimal health outcomes and reducing secondary transmission of HIV. However, YMSM often struggle with ART adherence. Novel mobile phone apps that incorporate game-based mechanics and social networking elements represent a promising intervention approach for improving ART adherence among YMSM. Objective: This study used a multiphase, iterative development process to create an ART adherence app for YMSM. Methods: The three-phase development process included: (1) theory-based concept development jointly by public health researchers and the technology team, (2) assessment of the target population's ART adherence needs and app preferences and development and testing of a clickable app prototype, and (3) development and usability testing of the final app prototype. Results: The initial theory-based app concept developed in Phase One included medication reminders, daily ART adherence tracking and visualization, ART educational modules, limited virtual interactions with other app users, and gamification elements. In Phase Two, adherence needs, including those related to information, motivation, and behavioral skills, were identified. Participants expressed preferences for an ART adherence app that was informational, interactive, social, and customizable. Based on the findings from Phase Two, additional gaming features were added in Phase Three, including an interactive battle, superhero app theme, and app storyline. Other features were modified to increase interactivity and customization options and integrate the game theme. During usability testing of the final prototype, participants were able to understand and navigate the app successfully and rated the app favorably. Conclusions: An iterative development process was critical for the development of an ART adherence game app that was viewed as highly acceptable, relevant, and useful by YMSM. © 2016 JMIR Publications Inc.

	abstract = {Mammals have developed a variety of suckling behaviours ranging from tenacious nipple attachment in some rodents and marsupials to once-a-day suckling in rabbit. However, a common feature of suckling that was found in many mammals is the suckling order, or a partial preference to suckle a particular teat (teat fidelity) or part of the udder (suckling preference). A lack of suckling order is observed only in a few mammals. In this article, the possible background of the presence or absence of suckling order in eutherian polytocous mammals is discussed either from the maternal investment or sibling competition point of view. Characteristics related to maternal investment in species in which the suckling order has already been studied at least partially, were classified using C4.5 algorithm (J48 classifier in Weka 3.8.1), and decision tree was built. In the context of sibling competition, an extensive form game (game theory) was predicted to show the optimal suckling strategy considering the basic relations among littermates in two situations (littermates of equal strength/dominance and littermates with different strength/dominance). Although no ultimate conclusion can be drawn, it appears that the suckling order is typical for species whose reproductive system requires a lower maternal investment (up to one litter/year, monogamy, biparental care, lower litter birth weight); and, it appears that the suckling order is inherent to the weaker (inferior) siblings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Robustness, defined as tolerance to perturbations such as mutations and environmental fluctuations, is pervasive in biological systems. However, robustness often coexists with its counterpart, evolvability—the ability of perturbations to generate new phenotypes. Previous models of gene regulatory network evolution have shown that robustness evolves under stabilizing selection, but it is unclear how robustness and evolvability will emerge in common coevolutionary scenarios. We consider a two-species model of coevolution involving one host and one parasite population. By using two interacting species, key model parameters that determine the fitness landscapes become emergent properties of the model, avoiding the need to impose these parameters externally. In our study, parasites are modeled on species such as cuckoos where mimicry of the host phenotype confers high fitness to the parasite but lower fitness to the host. Here, frequent phenotype changes are favored as each population continually adapts to the other population. Sensitivity evolves at the network level such that point mutations can induce large phenotype changes. Crucially, the sensitive points of the network are broadly distributed throughout the network and continually relocate. Each time sensitive points in the network are mutated, new ones appear to take their place. We have therefore named this phenomenon “whack-a-mole” sensitivity, after a popular fun park game. We predict that this type of sensitivity will evolve under conditions of strong directional selection, an observation that helps interpret existing experimental evidence, for example, during the emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance. © 2015 Shin, MacCarthy.},

Despite considerable progress in HIV stigma-reduction research, we are still searching for effective strategies that can be implemented on a larger scale. To narrow this research gap, the present study investigated a novel cost-effective approach to reducing HIV-related stigma among health professionals. Interactive experiential games were used to help participants gain first-hand experience of potential stressors that PLHIV might encounter. The effectiveness of this game-based experiential approach was compared with that of in vivo contact in reducing HIV-related stigma among students in the health-care fields. Eighty-eight students of health-related programs in Hong Kong were randomly assigned to either the game-based or in vivo contact program. They completed measures of stigmatizing attitudes and HIV/AIDS-related knowledge at pre-program, post-program, and one-month follow-up. Findings showed that the effectiveness of the game-based experiential approach in reducing HIV-related stigma was similar to that of in vivo contact both at post-program and one-month follow-up. Further research is needed to explore the potential value of the game-based approach in reducing HIV stigma among health professionals. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Alarming incidents of maternal deaths in Indonesia are due to three major causes: bleeding, sepsis, and hypertension, in addition to other non-obstetric causes and unsafe abortions. Adolescent girls contributed to maternal mortality based on early marriage, unwanted pregnancy, and childbirth. Prevention efforts have been taken through government programs and non-governmental organizations, but in practice those were considered ineffective. Thus, a preventative effort in the form of health education should be made, preferably embedded in a popular mobile application that most teenagers would be apt to use. This study aimed to develop an interactive health education model based on adolescent-friendly applications, according to their needs. The design of this research was mixed-method. A quantitative approach was used by conducting a survey of 188 teenagers aged 15–19 years in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia through questionnaires. This research also contained a qualitative component via in-depth interviews with students, parents, and counseling teachers. The quantitative results showed that respondents’ knowledge was low about male and female reproductive organs, prevention of pregnancy, and the use of condoms. Respondents’ attitudes toward risky behaviors indicate a positive attitude about smoking, drinking, and illegal drugs, as well as premarital sex, while respondents have a negative attitude toward unwanted pregnancies. Respondents’ attitudes toward application-based health education shows a high interest. Respondents desired that the application have privacy, up-to-date information, interesting features, can be discussed with peer groups and health workers, include a game, animation, and simulation, and can identify reproductive health independently. Qualitative results indicate the need for reliable, accessible, and personal sources of information. The next research recommendation is to develop an interactive health education model based on the application of Djuwita and evaluate its influence on the knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy of young women in maintaining their reproductive health. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

Health education efforts with college students are increasingly utilizing new technologies. Smartphone applications (apps) in particular are growing in popularity and use in all young adults. Purpose: Formative research was conducted to describe how college students in the southwestern United States use health/fitness apps to change behavior. Method: College students (n = 27) ages 18-30 reporting use of health/fitness apps were recruited on a large public university campus and participated in interviews about app choice, behavioral goals, features, and reasons for continued use. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes using a 4-person coding team and the qualitative research software NVivo. Results: Most participants downloaded an app to meet a goal and felt that the app helped them meet it. Two distinct groups emerged, those who used apps to support an established behavior and those who used them to adopt a new behavior. The majority of participants reported that acceptable apps were free, easy to use, provided visual/auditory cues, and had game-like rewards. Most participants strongly opposed linking their social media with apps and did not use those features. Discussion: College students use apps to meet different goals such as developing an exercise routine or improving eating habits. Examining what influences health/fitness app choices among college students may provide important insights for future interventions developed to promote app use over long periods of time. Translation to Health Education Practice: Health education programming may benefit from the use of apps, because college students are already adopting these technologies. Features that are important such as ease of use and game-like rewards can help health educators choose appropriate apps for college student programs. © 2015, Copyright © SHAPE America.},

	abstract = {Background: Over 50% of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, meaning that the pregnancy is mistimed, unplanned, or unwanted. Unintended pregnancy increases health risks for mother and child, leads to high economic costs for society, and increases social disparities. Mobile phone ownership is rapidly increasing, providing opportunities to reach at-risk populations with reproductive health information and tailored unintended pregnancy prevention interventions through mobile phone apps. However, apps that offer support for unintended pregnancy prevention remain unevaluated. Objective: To identify, describe, and evaluate mobile phone apps that purport to help users prevent unintended pregnancy. Methods: We conducted an extensive search of the Apple iTunes and Android Google Play stores for apps that explicitly included or advertised pregnancy prevention or decision-making support in the context of fertility information/tracking, birth control reminders, contraceptive information, pregnancy decision-making, abortion information or counseling, sexual communication/negotiation, and pregnancy tests. We excluded apps that targeted medical professionals or that cost more than US $1.99. Eligible apps were downloaded and categorized by primary purpose. Data extraction was performed on a minimum of 143 attributes in 3 domains: (1) pregnancy prevention best practices, (2) contraceptive methods and clinical services, and (3) user interface. Apps were assigned points for their inclusion of features overall and for pregnancy prevention best practices and contraceptive information. Results: Our search identified 6805 app descriptions in iTunes and Google Play. Of these, 218 unique apps met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Apps were grouped into 9 categories: fertility trackers (n=72), centers and resources (n=38), birth control reminders (n=35), general sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information (n=17), SRH information targeted specifically to young adults (YA) (n=16), contraceptive information (n=15), service or condom locators (n=12), pregnancy tests (n=10), and games (n=3). Twelve apps scored at least 50 points (out of 94) for overall number of features and at least 15 points (out of 21) for contraceptive information and pregnancy prevention best practices. Overall, 41% of apps did not mention any modern contraceptive methods and 23% mentioned only 1 method. Of apps that did mention a modern contraceptive method, fewer than 50% of these apps provided information on how to use it. YA SRH apps had the highest percentage of pregnancy prevention best practices in each app. Demographic and interface evaluation found that most apps (72%) did not target any race and only 10% explicitly targeted youth. Communication interface features were present in fewer than 50% of apps. Conclusions: This review identified several useful, evidence-based apps that support the prevention of unintended pregnancy. However, most apps miss opportunities to provide users with valuable information, interactive decision aids, and evidence-based interventions for unintended pregnancy prevention. Further, some apps in this space may increase the likelihood of unintended pregnancy due to the low effectiveness of the contraceptive methods promoted. © Emily Rose Mangone, Victoria Lebrun, Kathryn E.

Data were drawn from two coordinated, population-based studies of adolescents (Project Eating Among Teens 2010) and their parents (Project Families and Eating Among Teens). Surveys were completed during 2009-2010. Frequent television/movie watching during family meals by youth was reported by 25.5% of parents. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated significantly higher odds of mealtime media use (P<0.05) for girls and older teens. In addition, higher odds of mealtime media use (P<0.05) were also seen among those whose parents had low education levels or were black or Asian; having parental rules about media use significantly reduced these odds. Frequent mealtime media use was significantly associated with lower scores on family communication (P<0.05) and scores indicating less importance placed on mealtimes (P<0.001). Furthermore, frequent mealtime media use was associated with lower odds of serving green salad, fruit, vegetables, 100% juice, and milk at meals, whereas higher odds were seen for serving sugar-sweetened beverages (P<0.05).

	abstract = {Background: Mobile phones are an important part of adolescents' life. In this study, the relationships among smartphone addiction, age, gender, and chronotype of German adolescents were examined. Materials and methods: Two studies focused on two different measures of smartphone addiction. The Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale (SAPS) was applied to 342 younger adolescents (13.39 ± 1.77; 176 boys, 165 girls, and 1 not indicated) in Study 1 and the Smartphone Addiction Scale was applied to 208 older adolescents (17.07 ± 4.28; 146 girls and 62 boys) in Study 2, both samples in southwest Germany. In addition, a demographic questionnaire and the Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM) and sleep measures were implemented. Results: The most remarkable result of this study was that morningness-eveningness (as measured by CSM scores) is an important predictor for smartphone addiction; even stronger than sleep duration. Evening oriented adolescents scored higher on both smartphone addiction scales. In addition, gender is an important predictor for smartphone addiction and girls are more prone to become addicted. In addition, while sleep duration on weekdays negatively predicted SAPS, age, sleep duration on weekends, and midpoint of sleep on weekdays and weekends did not predicted smartphone addiction in both scales. The analysis of covariance revealed statistically significant effects of the covariates gender and age in both studies, as well as the main effect of chronotype. According to the t-test results, girls had higher scores than boys in smartphone addiction. Conclusion: Evening types and girls are more prone to become smartphone addicted. © 2016 The Author(s).},

Methods: 126 young adolescents were recruited from the Northeastern USA. Each type of media use was assessed using survey questions, time use diaries, and ecological momentary assessment. The Beck Depression Index for Primary Care was administered at baseline and 1 year later as part of a questionnaire that also included items assessing the presence of household rules about TV and video games. Results: Baseline use of mobile phones and TV viewing were associated with higher levels of depression 1 year later controlling for demographic information and baseline depression score. Having household rules about TV at baseline predicted lower levels of depression at follow-up. Conclusions: Both TV viewing and mobile phone use may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms. Implementing household rules about the duration and content of TV could help reduce depression in young adolescents. © 2015, Swiss School of Public Health.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have examined whether electronic games foster aggression. At present, the extent to which games contribute to aggression and the mechanisms through which such links may exist are hotly debated points. In current research we tested a motivational hypothesis derived from self-determination theory-that gaming would be associated with indicators of human aggression to the degree that the interactive elements of games serve to impede players' fundamental psychological need for competence. Seven studies, using multiple methods to manipulate player competence and a range of approaches for evaluating aggression, indicated that competence-impeding play led to higher levels of aggressive feelings, easier access to aggressive thoughts, and a greater likelihood of enacting aggressive behavior. Results indicated that player perceived competence was positively related to gaming motivation, a factor that was, in turn, negatively associated with player aggression. Overall, this pattern of effects was found to be independent of the presence or absence of violent game contents. We discuss the results in respect to research focused on psychological need frustration and satisfaction and as they regard gaming-related aggression literature. © 2013 American Psychological Association.},

The study is predicated on research suggesting that relationships exist between certain personality types and willingness to embrace technology and mobile phone ownership. The same might be argued between personality and certain mobile apps, to include games. Little research, however, has examined personality and mobile games. This is unfortunate, as these games lend themselves naturally to problem-solving challenges and are believed to aid with learning. Findings revealed that agreeableness was the most significant personality type in predicting frequency and number of hours spent playing mobile games, while openness was the most consistent predictor of mobile gaming as a whole. However, overall strength of associations was weak, suggesting care in using personality, as it may be a poor predictor. © The Author(s) 2015.},

	abstract = {Research limitations/implications - This research is limited to a sample of respondents based in the European Union, and based at a particular stage of big data and social media monitoring uptake. Subsequent research should look at how this uptake is occurring elsewhere, along with the medium to long-term implications of big data monitoring. Finally, subsequent research should consider how citizens and other social actors are coping with these emerging practices.; Originality/value - This chapter considers practices associated with big data monitoring and draws from cross-national empirical data. It stands in contrast to overly optimistic as well as well as totalising accounts of the social costs and consequences of big data. For these reasons, this chapter will be of value to scholars in internet studies, as well as privacy advocates and policymakers who are responsive to big data developments.; Purpose - Social media platforms, along with networked devices and applications, enable their user base to produce, access and circulate large volumes of data. On the one hand, this development contains an empowering potential for users, who can make otherwise obscured aspects of social life visible, and coordinate social action in accordance. Yet the preceding activities in turn render these users visible to governments as well as the multinational companies that operate these services. Between these two visions lie more nuanced accounts of individuals coordinating via social data for reactionary purposes, as well as policing and intelligence agencies struggling with the affordances of big data.; Design/methodology/approach - This chapter considers how individual users as well as police agencies respectively actualise the supposedly revolutionary and repressive potentials associated with big data. It briefly considers the broader social context in which 'big data' is situated, which includes the hardware, software, individuals and cultural values that render big data meaningful and useful. Then, in contrast to polarising visions of the social impact of big data, it considers two sets of practices that speak to a more ambivalent potentiality. First, recent examples suggest a kind of crowd-sourced vigilantism, where individuals rely on ubiquitous data and devices in order to reproduce law and order politics. Second, police agencies in various branches of European governments report a sense of obligation to turn to social data as a source of intelligence and evidence, yet attempts to do so are complicated by both practical and procedural challenges. A combination of case studies and indepth interviews offers a grounded understanding of big data in practice, in contrast to commonly held visions of these technologies.; Findings - First, big data is only ever meaningful in use. While they may be contained in databases in remote locations, big data do not exist in a social vacuum. Their impact cannot be fully understood in the context of newly assembled configurations or 'game-changing' discourses. Instead, they are only knowable in the context of existing practices. These practices can initially be the sole remit of public discourse shaped by journalists, tech-evangelists and even academics. Yet embodied individual and institutional practices also emerge, and this may contradict or at least complicate discursive assertions. Secondly, the range of devices and practices that make up big data are engaged in a bilateral relation with these practices. They may be a platform to further reproduce relations of information exchange and power relations. Yet they may also reconfigure these relations.

	abstract = {Background and aims: Adolescent Internet gambling is associated with concomitant addictive behaviors. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of Internet gambling practices, its impact upon psychosocial development and to evaluate the association between gambling practices and Internet addictive behavior among Cypriot adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a convenience sample (n = 805) of adolescents attending selected public schools (9th and 10th grades) in Cyprus. Anonymous self-completed questionnaires were used including the Internet Addiction Test and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: Among the study population (n = 805), approximately one third (n = 28; 34.9%) reported Internet gambling. Internet gamblers were twice as likely to utilize Internet café portals (adjusted odds ratio for gender and age, AOR: 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI: 1.56-2.91) for interactive game-playing (AOR: 6.84; 95% CI: 4.23-11.07), chat-rooms (AOR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.31-4.85), and retrieval of sexual information (AOR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.42-2.81). Among Internet gamblers 26.0% (n = 73) reported borderline addictive Internet use and 4.3% (n = 12) addictive behavior. Internet gamblers more often had comprehensive psychosocial and emotional maladjustment (AOR: 4.00; 95% CI: 1.97-8.13), including Abnormal Conduct Problems (AOR: 3.26; 95% CI: 2.00-5.32), Emotional Symptoms (AOR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.02-3.11), and Peer Problems (AOR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.08-5.48) scores. The multivariate regression analyses indicated that the single independent predictor associated with Internet addictive behavior was Internet gambling (AOR: 5.66; 95% CI: 1.45-22.15). Discussion: Internet gambling is associated with addictive Internet use, as well as emotional maladjustment and behavioral problems, among Cypriot adolescents. Conclusions: Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate whether Internet gambling constitutes a risk factor for the development of Internet addictive behavior among adolescents. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó.},

	abstract = {The Yucatan Peninsula is included as part of the initiative for the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. In its central area, are located three Protected Natural Areas (PNA): the Biocultural Puuc Reserve (RBP, by its Spanish acronym), the Bala'an K'aax flora and fauna protected area (APB, by its Spanish acronym), Quintana Roo, and the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (RBC, by its Spanish acronym), Campeche. The Puuc-Chenes region is located in the center of the Yucatan Peninsula - among these PNAs - which included important fragments of vegetation that in the past formed a continuum through the forests of the Yucatan Peninsula, constituting an important link to keep the connectivity of the Mayan forest. However, the expansion of the agricultural frontier is causing the fragmentation of the habitat. In the present study, the structural and functional connectivity of the Puuc-Chenes region is analyzed, based on habitat requirements of the Panthera onca (jaguar) by sex. Both, male and female, prefer tropical forest, however, P. onca males dare to transit in secondary vegetation and inclusively in agricultural areas. Males make inroads to villages more often than females, coming close to, and even crossing roads. P. onca males have a home range of 60 km2. In the present study, the ArcMap, FRAGSTATS and IDRISI software were used to analyses the structural and functional connectivity of the landscape, based on the known differences of habitat requirements for P. onca males and females. A vegetation and land use map of the studied area was elaborated, based on Landsat 7 ETM+ images, with 30 m size pixels. The following cover classes were differentiated: tropical forest, secondary forest, agriculture, urban, and water polls, which were validated in the fields. The Puuc-Chenes has an extension of 972 578 ha. Tropical forest was the dominant vegetation cover (49.8%) with the largest patch index covering 19.7% of the total landscape. The landscape had 2 509 fragments, from which 1 254 y 935 corresponded to secondary forest and anthropic patches, respectively. The contagion index was 62.5%, which indicates the existence oflarge and contiguous fragments. The total edge contrast index indicates the degree of landscape connectivity was 43.7%, meaning a medium contrast among the different class fragments. Likewise, forest had the highest area-weighted mean proximity index (PROX_AM de 8 701), confirming that the forest had bigger and less isolated fragments than the rest of the classes. The area of study, still have high value for the conservation of the habitat of the P onca. According to the results, we conclude that the Puuc-Chenes region has intermediate structural landscape connectivity, since a suitable corridor was identified for males and three corridors for both, males and females. Four priority fragments of forest were identified in the Puuc-Chenes landscape to be protected: the Puuc fragment with 1 916 km2, the Chenes fragment with 1 380 km2, the X'Panzil fragment with 679 km2 and the Noh-Ha fragment with 88.5 km2, which in total adds 4 063 km2 of identified landscape for the conservation of the jaguar. It is important to stress that the Puuc fragment — which has the largest extension — presents a high degree of perforation, this means, it does not conform a continuum forest mass, since other class of patches are immerse in it, which affects its connectivity and quality as a jaguar habitat. It was found that the habitat extension for the P. onca in the Puuc-Chenes landscape added to the adjacent ANPs’ area conform 15 943 km2, this ensure the persistence of the jaguar in the region. However, this zone has strong anthropic pressures, due to the expansion of ethnic groups and the establishment of new agricultural colonies in the Hopelchén municipality, resulting in extensive agriculture and use of heavy machinery, application of inorganic fertilizer and pesticides, which have detrimental effects in soil restoration and therefore in forest restoration. These changes are producing a cascade of negative effects for the habitat and game of the jaguar. For the reason that the jaguar is a cryptic organism, it is suggested to carry out more research in order to validate the identified corridors in the present study, utilizing field methods that enable to determine the presence and absence of the P. onca. It is also important, to elaborate habitat quality maps using variables such as game density, ecological conditions of the fragments and minor water sources, among them provisioning of minor water sources. This study provides robust elements based on scientific evidences that justified the conservation of four forest fragments in the Puuc-Chenes region that will help to preserve the habitat of the Panthera onca in this region. © 2017 Universidad Nacional Autonóma de México},

	abstract = {Objective: Meeting the complex needs of patients with chronic common mental health disorders (CMHDs) may be the greatest challenge facing organized medical practice. On the basis of a well-established and proven theoretical foundation for controlled respiration as a behavioral intervention for CMHDs, as well as preliminary evidence that gamification can improve health outcomes through increasing patient engagement, this randomized controlled pilot study evaluated the feasibility and clinical efficacy of a mobile health game called "Flowy" (www.flowygame.com) that digitally delivered breathing retraining exercises for anxiety, panic, and hyperventilation symptom management. Materials and Methods: We designed an unblinded, Web-based, parallel-group randomized controlled trial focusing on feasibility, clinical efficacy, and design proof of concept. In the intervention condition (n = 31), participants received free access to "Flowy" for 4 weeks. In the control condition (n = 32), participants were placed on a waitlist for 4 weeks before being offered free access to "Flowy." Online measurements using psychological self-report questionnaires were made at 2 and 4 weeks post-baseline. Results: At trial conclusion, participants found "Flowy" acceptable as an anxiety management intervention. "Flowy" engaged participants sufficiently to endorse proactive gameplay. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed a reduction in anxiety, panic, and self-report hyperventilation scores in both trial arms, with the intervention arm experiencing greater quality of life. Participants perceived "Flowy" as a fun and useful intervention, proactively used "Flowy" as part of their care, and would recommend "Flowy" to family and friends. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a digital delivery of breathing retraining exercises through a mobile health game can manage anxiety, panic, and hyperventilation symptoms associated with CMHDs.

	abstract = {Background: Obesity is a major healthcare problem in youth and their social/electronic media (SEM) use has been described as a risk factor. Though much is known about the newer technologies youth use to communicate, little is known about what is used by those in weight management programs. The aim of this study was to determine what types of SEM, including sedentary and active video games, youth in weight management programs use and which they prefer for communicating with healthcare providers. Methods/Design: This was a multisite study using a 24-question online SurveyMonkey® questionnaire. Youth, 12-17 years old, attending pediatric weight management programs at seven participating centers in the Childhood Obesity Multi Program Analysis and Study System network were eligible. Results: There were 292 responders with a mean age of 14.2 years. Fifty-four percent were female, 36% Caucasian, 35% African American, and 33% were Hispanic. Ninety-four percent had access to a computer, 71% had Internet access, and 63% had smartphones. Whereas 87% had at least one gaming system at home, 50% reported they never played sedentary video games (71% of females vs. 25% males; p<0.0001) and 63% never played exercise video games during the week. The preferred method of communication with a heathcare provider was face to face (60%), with few indicating a preference for communication by texting (13%), phone (12%), or social media (6%).

	abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that using technology and Internet-based methods in prevention programming can be an efficacious delivery practice. This literature implies that applying digital technologies to prevention may provide a unique opportunity to carry out interventions with reliability and in a manner that is more appealing and suitable to youth. This exploratory study reports on a proof-of-concept evaluation of Choices & Consequences, a substance abuse and relationship violence prevention program that integrates digital technologies and devices with game-based behavior change techniques. Six focus groups (. N=. 44) were conducted with youth living in a Southwestern city. Results suggest that youth preferred various aspects of this prevention game to traditional methods. They especially liked that the game was engaging and that they were able to learn in both formal and informal environments, that is interacting with each other and a facilitator or playing the game on their own. Results also found that youth learned many lessons while playing the game and they believe the game may help prevent substance abuse and relationship violence among the target population of early adolescents. Thus, this research suggests that prevention programs for youth that combine interactive methods, mobile technology, social networking, and competitive gaming could be a strong alternative to traditional delivery methods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Teaching basic computational concepts and skills to school children is currently a curricular focus in many countries. Running parallel to this trend are advances in programming environments and teaching methods which aim to make computer science more accessible, and more motivating. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Flip, a programming language that aims to help 11-15 year olds develop computational skills through creating their own 3D role-playing games. Flip has two main components: 1) a visual language (based on an interlocking blocks design common to many current visual languages), and 2) a dynamically updating natural language version of the script under creation. This programming-language/natural-language pairing is a unique feature of Flip, designed to allow learners to draw upon their familiarity with natural language to "decode the code". Flip aims to support young people in developing an understanding of computational concepts as well as the skills to use and communicate these concepts effectively. This paper investigates the extent to which Flip can be used by young people to create working scripts, and examines improvements in their expression of computational rules and concepts after using the tool. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of Flip before describing an evaluation study carried out with 12-13 year olds in a naturalistic setting. Over the course of 8 weeks, the majority of students were able to use Flip to write small programs to bring about interactive behaviours in the games they created. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in their computational communication after using Flip (as measured by a pre/post-test). An additional finding was that girls wrote more, and more complex, scripts than did boys, and there was a trend for girls to show greater learning gains relative to the boys. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Purpose of review Within the past 20 years, there have been profound advances in personal technology. Although adolescents have embraced the Internet, video games and smart phones, with their extraordinary potential for education, entertainment and connecting with peers, respectively, there is a 'dark side' to these new age technologies. This article identifies many of the adverse physical, psychological, developmental and emotional consequences of our new age technologies. Recent findings As Internet access has become easier, faster and more ubiquitous, there is increased evidence of its potential for direct and indirect harm to teens. Sexually explicit material is now indiscriminately available to youth, and studies have linked pornography with a number of negative health effects. Internet addiction is a problem even among teenagers who do not view pornography online. The rise of the Internet and social media sites now makes it easier for a student to bully a peer, and adolescents represent the majority of cyberbullying victims These technologies not only carry increased morbidity but also mortality, with increased suicides due to cyberbullying and motor vehicle deaths due to texting while driving. Summary Paediatricians play a critical role in educating adolescents and their parents about the risks associated with new age technologies. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health-Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Background: In 2015, 90% of US young adults with Internet access used social media. Digital and social media are highly prevalent modalities through which young adults explore identity formation, and by extension, learn and transmit norms about health and risk behaviors during this developmental life stage. Objective: The purpose of this study was to provide updated estimates of social media use from 2014 to 2016 and correlates of social media use and access to digital technology in data collected from a national sample of US young adults in 2016. Methods: Young adult participants aged 18-24 years in Wave 7 (October 2014, N=1259) and Wave 9 (February 2016, N=989) of the Truth Initiative Young Adult Cohort Study were asked about use frequency for 11 social media sites and access to digital devices, in addition to sociodemographic characteristics. Regular use was defined as using a given social media site at least weekly. Weighted analyses estimated the prevalence of use of each social media site, overlap between regular use of specific sites, and correlates of using a greater number of social media sites regularly. Bivariate analyses identified sociodemographic correlates of access to specific digital devices. Results: In 2014, 89.42% (weighted n, 1126/1298) of young adults reported regular use of at least one social media site. This increased to 97.5% (weighted n, 965/989) of young adults in 2016. Among regular users of social media sites in 2016, the top five sites were Tumblr (85.5%), Vine (84.7%), Snapchat (81.7%), Instagram (80.7%), and LinkedIn (78.9%). Respondents reported regularly using an average of 7.6 social media sites, with 85% using 6 or more sites regularly. Overall, 87% of young adults reported access or use of a smartphone with Internet access, 74% a desktop or laptop computer with Internet access, 41% a tablet with Internet access, 29% a smart TV or video game console with Internet access, 11% a cell phone without Internet access, and 3% none of these. Access to all digital devices with Internet was lower in those reporting a lower subjective financial situation; there were also significant differences in access to specific digital devices with Internet by race, ethnicity, and education. Conclusions: The high mean number of social media sites used regularly and the substantial overlap in use of multiple social media sites reflect the rapidly changing social media environment. Mobile devices are a primary channel for social media, and our study highlights disparities in access to digital technologies with Internet access among US young adults by race/ethnicity, education, and subjective financial status. Findings from this study may guide the development and implementation of future health interventions for young adults delivered via the Internet or social media sites.},

	abstract = {Research has shown that some individuals can develop excessive patterns of video-gaming, leading to significant psychological and interpersonal problems. Recent reviews of problematic gaming suggest that treatment is best approached from a cognitive-behavioural perspective. However, relatively little research has examined the underlying cognitive factors that might be usefully targeted in an intervention. To address this gap, we present the findings of a study involving N = 485 adult regular video-game players (84% male, Mage = 26 years) who completed a questionnaire about gaming activity, problematic gaming, and problematic cognitions. Gaming cognitions fell on four dimensions: (1) perfectionism, (2) cognitive salience, (3) regret, and (4) behavioural salience. All cognition subscales correlated moderately to highly with two different measures of problematic gaming (r =.49-.76), as well as a measure of emotional distress (DASS-21; r =.25-.35). Large effect sizes (d =.87-1.96) were found when comparing problematic and non-problematic gamers on all four cognition types. This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence for cognitive differences between problematic and non-problematic video-game players, and to identify specific cognitions which could be practically addressed in clinical settings. The implications for the further development and refinement of clinical approaches to problematic gaming, including formulation, assessment, and intervention, are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-five sources were included, mostly from Latin American Spanish speaking countries. Results: a predominance was found of educational interventions aimed at teenage pregnancy prevention by means of a variety of commonly-used information and communication technologies such as Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, text messaging, blogs and digital games, among others. Conclusions: it is concluded that many authors from the various countries consulted apply information and communication technologies as a strategy facilitating teaching-learning processes in sex education for teenagers, thus motivating and stimulating their active participation, reflection and analysis, and the achievement of the expected results. © 2018, Centro Nacional de Informacion de Ciencias Medicas.

	abstract = {The main aim was to analyse the effect of 8 weeks of Pokémon GO on cognitive performance (memory, selective attention, concentration, mathematical calculation and linguistic reasoning) and emotional intelligence (well-being, self-control, emotionality and sociability) in Spanish adolescents between 12 and 15 years. A longitudinal design was used, with a Control Group (n = 103) that did not use Pokémon GO, and Experimental Group (n = 87) that used Pokémon GO during 8 weeks. Age, sex, BMI, maternal educational level, number of computers at home and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were used as confounders. Results showed that players walked 54 km and spent 40 min/day playing in this period. Boys played more, won more points and reached a higher level in the game than girls. The players playing Pokémon GO significantly increased their selective attention (p = 0.003), concentration levels (p < 0.001), and sociability levels (p = 0.003) against their peers. It is concluded that Pokémon GO increases, in a playful way, the amount of daily exercise in adolescents, could positively affect their cognitive performance, and improve the social relationships. Further studies are required to perform comparisons between single and collaborative play and to identify the pedagogical benefits through some subjects such as Physical Education. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

This search included studies with video or computer games targeting nutrition, physical activity and obesity for children between 7 and 15 years of age. Results: The study distinguished between games that aimed to (i) improve knowledge about nutrition, eating habits and exercise; (ii) increase physical activity; or (iii) combine both approaches. Overall, the games were well accepted. On a qualitative level, most studies reported positive effects on obesity-related outcomes (improvement of weight-related parameters, physical activity or dietary behaviour/knowledge). However, the observed effects were small. The games did not address psychosocial aspects. Conclusions: Using video games for weight management exclusively does not deliver satisfying results. Video games as an additional guided component of prevention and treatment programs have the potential to increase compliance and thus enhance treatment outcome.

The findings revealed that the DCGs reported in the reviewed papers: (a) were used for the learning of diverse subject disciplines across all educational levels and leaning towards the school curriculum, in two ways: game-construction and game-play, (b) were mainly proposed by their designers as meaningful, familiar and appealing learning contexts, in order to motivate and engage players/students and also to promote social, rich and constructivist educational experiences while at the same time integrating modern technologies and innovative gamed-based approaches, (c) were implemented using a plethora of digital tools, (d) mainly adopted social and constructivist views of learning during their design and use, although the views were explicitly reported in only a few of these, (e) were evaluated – in more than half of the studies – with positive results in terms of: student learning, attitudes towards DCGs and enrichment of social interaction and collaboration, (f) appeared to support students to acquire essential thinking skills through DCG-play. However, despite the rich DCG-game experiences reported in the reviewed papers, some essential but under-researched topics were also specified. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Objective To quantify the relationships between youth use of television (TV) and other screen devices, including smartphones and tablets, and obesity risk factors. Study design TV and other screen device use, including smartphones, tablets, computers, and/or videogames, was self-reported by a nationally representative, cross-sectional sample of 24 800 US high school students (2013-2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys). Students also reported on health behaviors including sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, physical activity, sleep, and weight and height. Sex-stratified logistic regression models, adjusting for the sampling design, estimated associations between TV and other screen device use and SSB intake, physical activity, sleep, and obesity. Results Approximately 20% of participants used other screen devices for ≥5 hours daily. Watching TV ≥5 hours daily was associated with daily SSB consumption (aOR = 2.72, 95% CI: 2.23, 3.32) and obesity (aOR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.40, 2.27). Using other screen devices ≥5 hours daily was associated with daily SSB consumption (aOR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.69, 2.32), inadequate physical activity (aOR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.69, 2.25), and inadequate sleep (aOR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.54, 2.08). Conclusions Using smartphones, tablets, computers, and videogames is associated with several obesity risk factors. Although further study is needed, families should be encouraged to limit both TV viewing and newer screen devices. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

Drawing on a Foucauldian dispositive analysis that troubled the complex apparatus responsible for the production of knowledge and action in the neurology subspecialty of multiple sclerosis (MS), the case discloses how the pharmaceutical industry has created compliance and adherence as clinical imperatives in the practice of MS nursing. The case makes explicit the conscious transformative self-action undertaken by MS nurses as a result of their subjectivation (marketization) and demonstrates how MS nurses have become pawns in pharmaceutical industry strategic games of power, truth, identity, and wealth creation by turning their clinical practice settings into heterodiscursive spaces of surveillance and persuasion. MS nurses have become instruments of the pharmaceutical industry, and their clinical practices ordered, organized, limited, constrained, and marketized as a result. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Ineffective anger expression has been associated with essential hypertension (EH) and with blood pressure (BP) reactivity to stress. The ET-1/Lys198Asn polymorphism has been associated with increased resting BP and exaggerated vasoconstrictive mediated BP reactivity. African Americans (AAs) are at particular risk for development of EH, report greater anger difficulties, and exhibit greater vasoconstrictive reactivity than their European American (EA) counterparts. Purpose: The objective is to investigate a gene-environment model of stress reactivity in which anger expression, particularly in combination with ET-1 T allele carrier status and AA ethnicity, would be associated with the greatest vasoconstrictive reactivity in response to a behavioral stressor. Methods: One hundred ninety-one AA and 197 EA normotensive young adults (M age = 18.8 ± 2.5 years) participated in the study. Total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) reactivity was assessed during a 10-min video game challenge. Anger expression was measured using Spielberger's Anger Expression Scale. Results: A multiple regression model with TPRI reactivity as the dependent variable revealed a three-way interaction effect for anger management (i.e., AM = anger control minus anger out scores), ethnicity, and ET-1 polymorphism. Specifically, AA carriers of the ET-1 polymorphism with poor AM skills exhibited the greatest TPRI reactivity. Conclusions: Individuals with a genetic predisposition for exaggerated vasoconstriction who also display low AM skills may be at particular risk for development of stress-induced EH. Such individuals may particularly benefit from anger management training. © 2005 by The Society of Behavioral Medicine.},

	abstract = {Background: Interactive video gaming has become ubiquitous in the practice of rehabilitation. The Nintendo Wii is one such system. Interactive gaming can promote intensive task-based therapy in a manner that is motivating for the user. Widespread enthusiasm for consoles and their games prompted us to analyze the games for their rehabilitation elements related to improving balance and mobility for individuals poststroke. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to provide a game analysis for clinical application and evaluation of the game elements for research on interactive video gaming. Methods: Using a team of game players and raters, 5 tables (1 for the Wii Sports and 4 for the Wii Fit) were developed and validated. The tables consist of 3 categories: game description, impairments targeted (strength, endurance, balance, and coordination), and feedback provided (knowledge of performance [KP] and knowledge of results [KR]). Two domain content experts established face validity. Construct validity was performed by 2 therapist-raters who had more than 15 years' clinical experience and postgraduate training in motor learning. Observations about the games including the fidelity of the interfaces, the nature of the feedback, and some of the challenges to adapting the games for rehabilitation are presented. Results: An 80% agreement between raters set as the criterion for establishing the construct validity was met for feedback evaluation. There was 100% agreement on impairment ratings. Games provide a greater amount of KR compared with KP. Conclusion: Given the preponderance of KR, therapists will need to monitor motor performance. Adaptation of interactive video consoles for rehabilitation requires careful evaluation of the games' attributes using relevant rehabilitation construits. © 2011 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.},

METHODS: Parents (n = 745, study 1; n = 768, study 2; n = 769, study 3) were surveyed nationally by independent research firms. Studies 1 and 2 were conducted by Harris Interactive, and study 3 was conducted by Research Now. All of them were cross-sectional national surveys. RESULTS: Parents desire ratings for many types of media, but they do not think the existing ratings accurately provide the information they want. They would prefer ratings to provide detailed content information. In general, parents tend to agree on the types and descriptors of content about which they would like to know. They do not, however, agree on the ages for which different content aspects are appropriate. Parents would support the creation of a universal rating system that could be applied to multiple types of media. CONCLUSIONS: Ratings can be effective only if they are useful for parents. This set of studies reveals that improvements in media ratings are needed to make them valuable for parents. Copyright © 2011 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.},

	abstract = {From 1996 to 2001, researchers at 10 Appalachian study sites collected radiotracking data sufficient to delineate 1,054 seasonal home ranges of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus; hereafter "grouse"). Using information-theoretic model selection and paired comparison of home ranges from individual grouse, we evaluated individual, local, and landscape factors hypothesized to affect grouse home-range size. Females and juvenile males occupied home ranges that averaged >2x larger than those of adult males, and home ranges of females averaged 2.6x larger during successful breeding seasons than during years of reproductive failure. Clearcuts and forest roads are considered high-quality covers, and both were more prevalent in smaller home ranges. Several factors operating at a regional and landscape scale were also important. Previous studies have reported that southern grouse use relatively large home ranges, and we observed a continuous decline in home-range size with increasing latitude across the 710-km range spanned by our study sites. Home-range size of males, particularly juvenile males, was positively related to an index of population density. Given the species' "dispersed lekking" mating system, we interpret this as evidence of competition for preferred display sites. As has been reported for other game birds, all sex and age classes of grouse used smaller home ranges following closure of sites to hunting. Grouse inhabiting oak-hickory forests used larger home ranges than conspecifics in mixed mesophytic forests, and other factors interacted with forest type. In oak-hickory forests, female home-range size was inversely related to use of mesic bottomlands, which support important forage plants, and home ranges of adult grouse increased 2.5x following poor hard-mast crops. By contrast, home ranges of grouse inhabiting mixed mesophytic forests were unrelated to use of bottomlands, and the influence of hard mast was reduced. This is in line with the view that in Appalachian oak-hickory forests, grouse are under strong nutritional constraint. However, this constraint is reduced in mixed mesophytic forests, likely because of the presence of high-quality alternative foods (e.g., cherry [Prunus spp.] and birch [Betula spp.]). © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2007.},

A narrative analysis of the papers was adopted to elicit common themes emerging from the studies. Of 99 papers identified, only 6 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Interventions which seek to effect attitudinal and behavioural change through interactive methods such as role-play, video games and group work led to a self-reported reduction in both risk from drugs and sexual activity. The evidence for maintenance of risk reduction over one year remains unclear. Interventions do not appear to promote risky sexual activity in previously sexually inactive participants. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Background: Problematic internet use (PIU) is associated with a plethora of psychosocial adversities. The study objectives were to assess the determinants and psychosocial implications associated with potential PIU and PIU among adolescents. Methods. A cross-sectional study design was applied among a random sample (n = 866) of Greek adolescents (mean age: 14.7 years). Self-completed questionnaires, including internet use characteristics, Young Internet Addiction Test, and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, were utilized to examine the study objectives. Results: Among the study population, the prevalence rates of potential PIU and PIU were 19.4% and 1.5%, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression indicated that male gender (Odds Ratio, OR: 2.01; 95% Confidence Interval, 95% CI: 1.35-3.00), as well as utilizing the internet for retrieving sexual information (OR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.53-4.12), interactive game playing (OR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.21-2.82), and socialization, including chat-room use (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.36-2.86) and email (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.05-2.24), were independently associated with potential PIU and PIU. Adolescents with potential PIU had an increased likelihood of concomitantly presenting with hyperactivity (OR: 4.39; 95% CI: 2.03-9.52) and conduct (OR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.46-4.50) problems. Moreover, adolescent PIU was significantly associated with hyperactivity (OR: 9.96; 95% CI: 1.76-56.20) and conduct (OR: 8.39; 95% CI: 2.04-34.56) problems, as well as comprehensive psychosocial maladjustment (OR: 8.08; 95% CI: 1.44-45.34). Conclusions: The determinants of potential PIU and PIU include accessing the internet for the purposes of retrieving sexual information, game playing, and socialization. Furthermore, both potential PIU and PIU are adversely associated with notable behavioral and social maladjustment among adolescents. © 2011 Kormas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Faced with an intermittent but potent threat, animals exhibit behavior that allows them to balance foraging needs and avoid predators and over time, these behaviors can become hard-wired adaptations with both species trying to maximize their own fitness. In systems where both predator and prey share similar sensory modalities and cognitive abilities, such as with marine mammals, the dynamic nature of predator-prey interactions is poorly understood. The costs and benefits of these anti-predator adaptations need to be evaluated and quantified based on the dynamic engagement of predator and prey. Many theoretic models have addressed the complexity of predator-prey relationships, but few have translated into testable mechanistic models. In this study, we developed a spatially-explicit, geo-referenced, individual-based model of a prototypical adult dusky dolphin off Kaikoura, New Zealand facing a more powerful, yet infrequent predator, the killer whale. We were interested in two primary objectives, (1) to capture the varying behavioral game between a clever prey and clever predator based on our current understanding of the Kaikoura system, (2) to compare evolutionary costs vs. benefits (foraging time and number of predator encounters) for an adult non-maternal dusky dolphin at various levels of killer whale-avoidance behaviors and no avoidance rules. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to address model performance and parametric uncertainty. Mantel tests revealed an 88% correlation (426×426 distance matrix, km2) between observed field sightings of dusky dolphins with model generated sightings for non-maternal adult dusky dolphin groups. Simulation results indicated that dusky dolphins incur a 2.7% loss in feeding time by evolving the anti-predator behavior of moving to and from the feeding grounds. Further, each evolutionary strategy we explored resulted in dolphins incurring an additional loss of foraging time. At low killer whale densities (appearing less than once every 3 days), each evolutionary strategy simulated converged towards the evolutionary cost of foraging, that is, the loss in foraging time approached the 2.7% loss experienced by evolving near shore-offshore movement behavior. However, the highest level of killer whale presence resulted in 38% decreases in foraging time. The biological significance of these losses potentially incurred by a dusky dolphin is dependent on various factors from dolphin group foraging behavior and individual energy needs to dolphin prey availability and behavior. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Aims: To provide a snapshot content analysis of social media marketing among leading alcohol brands in the UK, and to outline the implications for both regulatory policies and further research. Methods: Using screengrab technology, the complete Facebook walls and Twitter timelines for 12 leading UK alcohol brands in November 2011 were captured and archived. A total of 701 brand-authored posts were identified and categorized using a thematic coding frame. Key strategic trends were identified and analysed in the light of contextual research into recent developments in marketing practice within the alcohol industry. Results: A number of dominating trends were identified. These included the use of real-world tie-ins, interactive games, competitions and timespecific suggestions to drink. These methods reflect a strategy of branded conversation-stimulus which is favoured by social media marketing agencies. Conclusion: A number of distinct marketing methods are deployed by alcohol brands when using social media. These may undermine policies which seek to change social norms around drinking, especially the normalization of daily consumption. Social media marketing also raises questions regarding the efficacy of reactive regulatory frameworks. Further research into both the nature and impact of alcohol marketing on social media is needed.© The Author 2012. Medical Council on Alcohol and Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The Internet has become all pervasive in the lives of young people and this paper will review studies that examine the risks and opportunities that it affords. We will examine research that investigates the more negative aspects of youth online behavior such as addiction as well as online risks such as harassment/cyber bullying and sexual solicitation. In addition, positive aspects of Internet use such as its potential for learning and enhancing social relations as well as delivering health interventions will be examined. RECENT FINDINGS: The results show that online risks such as addiction, cyber bullying, and sexual solicitation are associated with negative consequences for youth. It is important to note that not all children are equally susceptible and more research is necessary to identify the youth most at risk as well as to develop effective interventions. The Internet can also provide benefits in the areas of cognitive, social, and physical development, and can also be used to deliver treatment interventions. SUMMARY: The Internet represents both risks and opportunities for young people. To protect youth who are at risk for online addiction, bullying, and solicitation, we need more research to understand which youth may be most susceptible and to develop targeted interventions to protect them. The Internet also has many positive aspects and can be used to enhance youth learning and empowerment; although it is a tremendous health resource and can be used to cheaply deliver interventions, we need to understand how to better implement them to enhance their effectiveness. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

	abstract = {This report describes the results of nonvolant mammal inventory fieldwork at Paracou, a lowland rainforest locality in northern French Guiana, and concludes the faunal analysis introduced by our previous monograph on the bats of Paracou (Simmons and Voss, 1998). Working within a 3-km radius over the course of 202 sampling dates from 1991 to 1994, we recorded a total of 64 nonvolant species by conventional trapping, arboreal platform trapping, pitfall trapping, diurnal and nocturnal hunting, and interviews with local residents. Included in this total species count are 12 marsupials, 9 xenarthrans, 6 primates, 10 carnivores, 5 ungulates, and 22 rodents. Systematic research with nonvolant mammal specimens collected as voucher material resulted in the discovery of new taxa, documented range extensions of previously described species, and helped resolve many longstanding taxonomic problems: (1) Gracilinanus emiliae (Thomas), herein reported for the first time from French Guiana, is redescribed and its known geographic distribution documented; based on examination of type material and original descriptions, G. longicaudus Hershkovitz is considered a junior synonym of G. emiliae, but Marmosa agricolai Moojen is not. (2) A new genus is proposed for Gracilinanus kalinowskii Hershkovitz, a taxon previously known only from eastern Peru, in recognition of its trenchant morphological differences from all other known didelphimorph marsupials. (3) Marmosops parvidens (Tate) and M. pinheiroi (Pine), the latter originally described as a subspecies of the former, are distinct species that occur sympatrically at Paracou; based on examination of type material, other taxa hitherto synonymized with M. parvidens are also judged to be valid species, including M. juninensis (Tate) and M. bishopi (Pine). (4) Monodelphis brevicaudata (Erxleben), M. glirina (Wagner), and M. palliolata (Osgood) are all distinct species diagnosable by unique combinations of morphological traits; based on examined specimens, M. brevicaudata (with type locality emended herein as Kartabo, Guyana) appears to be endemic to the Guiana subregion of Amazonia and to include both bicolored and tricolored phenotypes; a neotype from Cayenne, French Guiana, is designated to fix the application of Viverra touan Shaw as the oldest available name for the tricolored form. (5) Saguinus midas (Linnaeus) and S. niger (E. Geoffroy), currently treated as synonyms or conspecific races, are unambiguously diagnosable species that do not appear to be sister taxa; a neotype is designated to conserve current usage of niger E. Geoffroy for the black-handed tamarin of southeastern Amazonia. (6) Two new small species of Neacomys are described from material collected at Paracou; their diagnostic attributes are documented by detailed comparisons with other like-sized congeners from northern South America. (7) Nectomys melanius Thomas is recognized as a species distinct from N. squamipes (Brants) and N. palmipes J. A. Allen and Chapman; however, N. parvipes Petter is not a valid taxon and is herein synonymized with N. melanius. (8) The diagnostic characters of Neusticomys oyapocki (Petter and Dubost), a species previously known only from the holotype, are reevaluated and illustrated from freshly collected material. (9) Oecomys auyantepui Tate and O. paricola (Thomas), previously treated as synonyms, are valid species distinguished by consistent cranial differences and occupy allopatric ranges north and south of the Amazon, respectively. (10) A critical examination of small Oecomys specimens from Paracou and other Guianan localities supports the conclusions of other investigators that O. rutilus Anthony and O. bicolor (Tomes) are unambiguously diagnosable species. (11) Oligoryzomys fulvescens (Saussure) and O. microtis (J. A. Allen), currently regarded as valid allopatric species occurring north and south of the Amazon, respectively, are difficult to diagnose unambiguously and may be conspecific; new information is provided about the hitherto ambiguous type locality of the latter taxon. (12) Rhipidomys nitela Thomas is reported from French Guiana for the first time and its previously unpublished diagnostic differences from other congeners are tabulated and discussed. (13) A lectotype is designated for Coendou melanurus (Wagner), and the species is redescribed based on all known specimens in North American and European museums; diagnostic differences between this species and C. insidiosus (Olfers) are illustrated for the first time. (14) A red-rumped agouti (Dasyprocta) is designated as the neotype of Mus aguti Linnaeus to preserve current usage of Dasyprocta prymnolopha (Wagler) for the black-rumped agouti. (15) The diagnostic differences between red and green acouchies (Myoprocta) are discussed and a neotype is designated for Cavia acouchy Erxleben to fix the application of that name to the red species; other nominal taxa of Myoprocta are identified as red or green acouchies based on examination of type material and original descriptions. (16) The diagnostic morphological traits of Proechimys cuvieri Petter and P. guyannensis (E. Geoffroy) are reevaluated and discussed based on character variation in topotypical (French Guianan) material. Analyses of our sampling results indicate that distinct sets of nonvolant species are effectively sampled by different inventory methods, and that increased sampling effort with any method generally results in more species. Although the rate of discovery of new species always decreases with increasing sample size, none of our graphs of species accumulation indicate that an asymptotic value was reached with any method. Instead, nonparametric statistical extrapolations suggest that the Paracou nonvolant mammal fauna consists of somewhere between 69 and 74 species; by implication, our nonvolant inventory is about 86-93% complete. Most missing species are probably marsupials and rodents, but one or two expected primate species might have been locally extirpated by hunters prior to our fieldwork. In terms of higher taxonomic composition, the Paracou nonvolant mammal fauna is typical of those found throughout the humid Neotropical lowlands. However, a quantitative analysis of nonvolant faunal similarity at the species level among 12 exemplar rainforest inventories first clusters the Paracou list with others from the Guiana subregion of Amazonia, next with lists from elsewhere in Amazonia, and lastly with Central American lists. Pairwise similarity values likewise show an obvious positive correlation between faunal resemblance and geographic proximity within the Neotropical rainforest biome. At least 24 species (38%) of the Paracou nonvolant fauna are Amazonian endemics, but 18 (28%) are essentially pan-Neotropical in distribution; the remaining 22 species exhibit a variety of distributional patterns that suggest past connections among different sets of currently disjunct rainforested regions. Species richness comparisons among nonvolant faunal inventories are complicated by a variety of familiar problems including inconsistent methodology, presence or absence of certain key habitats, and uneven sampling effort. A conservative interpretation of sampling results from La Selva (Costa Rica), Paracou, and Manu (Peru), however, suggests progressive increases in richness of about 23% from Central America to the Guianas, and of about the same amount from the Guianas to western Amazonia; over the entire gradient (Central America to western Amazonia), the net increase in observed richness is at least 50%. Whereas rodents are consistently the most diverse clade in all well-sampled nonvolant faunas, rankings of other orders by relative richness exhibit considerable site-to-site variation, at least some of which appears to reflect real geographic differences in taxonomic diversity rather than sampling artifacts. Nonvolant rainforest mammals are hard to classify into trophic guilds due to behavioral plasticity and incomplete knowledge of relevant natural history. Preliminary guild comparisons among three exemplar faunas, however, suggest that the Paracou nonvolant community is substantially less diverse in arboreal frugivores and more diverse in terrestrial animalivores than are nonvolant communities at some Central American and western Amazonian sites. Subsistence and recreational hunting has clearly affected local populations of some nonvolant mammals at Paracou; whereas popular game species (e.g., large primates) were seldom sighted, density compensation may explain high local densities of certain other taxa (e.g., Potus flavus and Cuniculus paca). Patterns of differential habitat use between closely related nonvolant species at Paracou were mostly observed within the terrestrial granivore/frugivore guild. Combining these results with those previously reported for the sympatric bat fauna, we recorded a total of 142 mammalian species at Paracou. By statistical extrapolation from our sampling data, the entire local community perhaps contains 155-168 species; because the known French Guianan rainforest mammal fauna contains at least 167 species for which suitable habitat is present in our study area, such estimates are plausible. By implication, our inventory is perhaps 85-92% complete overall. A synthesis of biogeographic information analyzed in this monograph and by Simmons and Voss (1998) suggests that faunal turnover with increasing geographic distance is much higher for nonvolant mammals than for bats, a necessary consequence of observed group differences in endemicity: whereas many nonvolant rainforest mammals have geographic ranges bounded by obvious topographic or habitat discontinuities (e.g., large rivers, xeromorphic vegetation), most rainforest bats are geographically widespread. Not surprisingly, most of the taxa that usefully define a Guianan center of mammalian endemism are nonvolant species.},

	abstract = {Neandertals were effective hunters of large ungulates throughout their geographic and temporal ranges. Equipped with this knowledge, researchers in paleoanthropology continue to seek insight on the relationships between hunting and subsistence strategies with other components of the Neandertals' niche, such as mobility, site use, and lithic technology. The Quina Mousterian deposits from the rockshelter site of Chez Pinaud Jonzac (Charente-Maritime, France; hereafter Jonzac) offer an excellent opportunity to pursue these issues. This paper focuses on the extensive and well-preserved skeletal remains of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) recovered from recent excavations of the site, representing at least 18 individuals that were hunted by Neandertals during the fall through winter. Our zooarchaeological results indicate that all ages of reindeer were hunted but adult individuals predominate. No bias is evident in the comparable frequencies of males and females. These prey were butchered on-site, with abundant evidence of meat filleting and marrow exploitation. In the excavated sample, the absence of hearths and the almost complete lack of burned bones or stones suggest that Neandertals were not using fire to assist with processing the reindeer carcasses. The zooarchaeological results presented here indicate that reindeer were hunted during a restricted window of time when they were seasonally abundant in the local area near Jonzac. Taken together with the lithic industry based on bifacial elements, the evidence is consistent with a pattern of site use by highly mobile hunter-gatherers making frequent, short-term visits. Ongoing research at Jonzac and other Quina Mousterian localities will contribute to a better understanding of Neandertal behavior during cold climate phases. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer face a potentially life-altering treatment decision that can be overwhelming. Enhancing patient knowledge through education can significantly reduce feelings of uncertainty while simultaneously increasing confidence in decision making. Serious games have been shown in other populations to increase health knowledge and assist with the health decision-making process. We developed an interactive serious game, Time After Time, which translates evidence-based treatment outcome data into an accessible and understandable format that men can utilize in their prostate cancer treatment decision-making process. The game specifically aims to raise men's awareness and understanding of the impact of health-related quality of life issues associated with the major treatment options and to enrich their conversations with their health care providers. Objective: This study determined the acceptability and usability of the alpha version of Time After Time, an interactive decision aid for men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, in order to inform future iterations of the serious game. Methods: The study employed a mixed methods approach to assess the acceptability and usability of the Time After Time serious game using qualitative focus groups and a quantitative Likert scale survey. Results: A total of 13 men who had already completed treatment for localized prostate cancer completed the survey and participated in focus group meetings. The majority of the study participants rated Time After Time as an appropriate decision tool for localized prostate cancer and verified that it meets its goals of increasing focus on side effects and generating questions for the patient's health care team. However, participants also expressed concerns about game usability and the diversity of information covered regarding treatment options and potential treatment outcomes. Conclusions: Serious games are a promising approach to health education and decision support for older men. Participants were receptive to the idea of a serious game as a decision aid in localized prostate cancer. However, usability issues are a major concern for this demographic, as is clarity and transparency of data sources. © Lindsey Reichlin.},

	abstract = {The role of men in hunter-gatherer societies has been subject to vigorous debate over the past 15 years. The proposal that men hunt wild game as a form of status signaling or "showing off" to provide reproductive benefits to the hunter challenges the traditional view that men hunt to provision their families. Two broad assumptions underlie the signaling view: (1) hunting is a poor means of obtaining food, and (2) hunted game is a public good shared widely with others and without expectation of future reciprocation. If hunters lack the ability to direct food shares and obtain subsequent benefits contingent on redistribution, then the ubiquitous observations of male hunting and universal pair-bonding cannot be explained from a perspective that emphasizes kin provisioning and a division of labor. Here we show that there is little empirical support for the view that men hunt for signaling benefits alone. The ethnographic record depicts a more complex relationship between food sharing patterns, subsistence strategies, mating, and the sexual division of labor. We present a framework incorporating trade-offs between mating and subsistence strategies in an economic bargaining context that contributes to understanding men's and women's roles in huntergatherer societies. © 2009 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

A 2 × 2 experiment, the first of its kind, examined how self-perception and attitudes changed after women (N = 86) entered a fully immersive virtual environment and embodied sexualized or nonsexualized avatars which featured either the participant's face or the face of an unknown other. Findings supported the Proteus effect. Participants who wore sexualized avatars internalized the avatar's appearance and self-objectified, reporting more body-related thoughts than those wearing nonsexualized avatars. Participants who saw their own faces, particularly on sexualized avatars, expressed more rape myth acceptance than those in other conditions.

	abstract = {The purpose of this exploratory study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot HIV prevention intervention with one of the most mobile of U.S.-Mexico transborder populations: Mexican/Latino migrant day laborers (MDLs). Intervention development was informed by preliminary research that included an HIV risk survey of over a hundred MDLs, and a focus group to explore the topic of HIV in the lives of MDLs. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to evaluate the intervention, and to identify some of the contextual characteristics of HIV risk factors in the MDL experience. For example, the most frequent theme revealed by qualitative analysis was the stressful and vulnerable state of desesperación [desperation], resulting from earning too littlemoney, that participants linked to deviating from their migration goals and succumbing to alcohol and drug use, and risky sex. While empirical results are limited by the small sample of convenience (N = 23), lack of a control group, and loss of about half of the sample by one month follow-up evaluation, findings were encouragingly consistent with intervention goals: Post-intervention data revealed what appear to be substantial gains in carrying condoms (e.g., from 43% to 83%) as well as in knowledge of proper condom use. Further, frequency of sex with risky sex partners decreased in general, while condom use was reported for all sexual encounters assessed during post-evaluation. The theoretical framework used to guide the intervention, a hybrid of the Health Belief Model and Friere's model of participatory education, included visual triggers composed of customized Mexican lottery game cards to elicit discussion of HIV risk and prevention in the MDL experience. © 2006 The Haworth Press, Inc.

According to predictions of game theory models, any decision to resort to unrestrained combat without prior careful behavioral assessment of the opponent's fighting abilities carries great risks. The present study examines the significance of internal hunger states and the presence of chemical food cues in this decision process using a 2 × 2 factorial design. Hungry crayfish escalated more rapidly, and thus took greater risks, during agonistic encounters, while the presence of a food source reduced the rate at which fights increased in intensity. However, there were no significant differences in fighting behavior as a result of the interaction between these two variables. We then address the complex trade-offs that individuals face in fighting with respect to increased risks of injury, appetitive states, and opportunities for resource access.},

	abstract = {Background: Increases in the aging population and in the number of accidents have resulted in more people suffering from physical impairments or disabilities. Rehabilitation therapy thus attracts greater attention as a means of helping patients recover and return to a normal life. With the extremely long and tedious nature of traditional rehabilitation, patients are reluctant to continue the entire process, thus the expected effects of the therapy cannot be obtained. Games are well known to help patients improve their concentration and shift their attention away from the discomfort of their injuries during rehabilitation. Thus, incorporating game technology into a rehabilitation program may be a promising approach. Methods: In this study, a gaming system used for shoulder rehabilitation was developed. The mechanical parts and electric circuits were integrated to mimic the functionalities of a shoulder wheel. Several games were also designed to suit the rehabilitation needs of the patients based on the age and gender differences among the individual users, enabling individuals to undergo the rehabilitation process by playing games. Two surveys were conducted to evaluate the satisfaction of the participants regarding the gaming system. Results: The results of the online survey among a larger population coincide with the responses of the hands-on participants through a paper-and-pencil survey. Statistical results suggest that the participants are willing to accept this novel approach. Conclusion: This gaming system can distract a patient from the sensation of pain or anxiety, and increase their motivation to participate in the therapeutic program. Advantages in terms of low-cost and easy setup increase the attractiveness of this new equipment for various potential users. © 2012 Chang et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.},

	abstract = {Communal egg-laying is widespread among animals, occurring in insects, mollusks, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds, just to name a few. While some benefits of communal egg-laying may be pervasive (e.g., it saves time and energy and may ensure the survival of mothers and their offspring), the remarkable, diversity in the life histories of the animals that exhibit this behavior presents a great challenge to discovering any general explanation. Reptiles and amphibians offer ideal systems for investigating communal egg-laying because they generally lack parental care-a simplification that brings nest site choice behavior into sharp focus. We exhaustively reviewed the published literature for data on communal egg-laying in reptiles and amphibians. Our analysis demonstrates that the behavior is much more common than previously recognized (occurring in 481 spp.), especially among lizards (N = 255 spp.), where the behavior has evolved multiple times. Our conceptual review strongly suggests that different forces may be driving the evolution and maintenance of communal egg-laying in different taxa. Using a game theory approach, we demonstrate how a stable equilibrium may occur between solitary and communal layers, thus allowing both strategies to co-exist in some populations, and we discuss factors that may influence these proportions. We conclude by outlining future research directions for determining the proximate and ultimate causes of communal egg-laying. Copyright © 2009 by The University of Chicago Press.

	abstract = {The present work completes an exhaustive revision of the delimitation of the ability of perspective taking from different points of view. First, perspective taking is defined as the ability of an individual to interpret his/hers emotional and mental states and those of others. Additionally, the term has also been used in medical settings to refer to a tactic intended to stop certain limiting feeling and/or thoughts and instead move feelings and thoughts towards a different direction. At the same time, perspective taking is considered to be at the heart of psychological phenomena such as empathy, that is, the capacity to distinguish what individuals know about themselves in a certain situation (how someone thinks, feels and behaves), self-awareness, interpersonal relations, and various social skills deficits. Second, this ability is conceptualized as a meta-cognition and it is assumed that the object of study is the theory of the mind. Third, from a developmental perspective, data have shown that children four to five years old, without any psychological disabilities, have the ability to take somebody else's perspective. We reviewed different studies regarding the development of the abilities to express and interpret emotions as precursors to perspective taking. Subsequently, we revised and analyzed the tests or strategies most commonly used to evaluate the ability of perspective taking. Typically, the capacity of an individual to have "a theory of the mind" is determined through tests of false beliefs (such as the classic test of Sally-Anne, the "Smarties" test, "M&M's", and the "Maxi's" Test). Multiple variations of the tests of false beliefs have been conducted with flashcards or photographs, with characters in oral stories, and through the use of games. Additionally, over the last few years the focus of this body of research has evolved towards the elaboration and validation instruments to measure empathy. Among them are the tests of Empathy Quotient (EQ), the Friendship Questionnaire (FQ), and reading the "mind" in the eyes. It is important to note that these efforts have been focused mostly on individuals with Asperger's Syndrome or those with higher verbal capabilities. From this latter perspective, we propose empirical evidence that points out to differences in the ability of perspective taking between children with or without autism. This is also shown in the results of previous studies, in which different levels of perspective taking skills were seen between children diagnosed with autism, and those diagnosed with Down Syndrome. It is important to note that this was not true when their verbal skills were not considered as a variable. Likewise, other studies showed that children with autism were not the only ones that failed the theory of the mind tests, but that these tests were also failed by those children with deficits in language and cognitive skills. In this article, we present the results of a study that replicates previous findings which show that typical developing children perform better in perspective taking tests, followed by children diagnosed with Down Syndrome, and subsequently by children with autism. It was also noted that the typical developing children showed the highest level of verbal discrimination, followed by the children diagnosed with Down Syndrome, and finally the children diagnosed with autism. One important finding in this study is that all children benefited from the use of contextual prompts, which improved the number of correct responses across all the theory of the mind tests. Additionally, the data varied depending on the type of tests utilized to measure perspective taking skills. In this article, we have also reviewed the different explanations for the origins and development of perspective taking, among which the theory of the mind prevails. The ability to take someone else's perspective is explained by the development or maturation of an innate and specialized module of representations and knowledge, and the formation of conceptual structures of a higher order or meta-representations. Additionally, the ability to ignore perceptual information, salient or not, and to combine simultaneously various contexts are considered prerequisites. In other words, perspective taking speaks to the relationship between psychological constructs such as perception and knowledge. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that shared, joint, or independent attention can be a prerequisite for conversation, and may be the basis of a theory of the mind. In any case, the origins of the development of such a theory have been especially ubiquitous in terms of the executive function and possible relations with cerebral lesions or alterations. However, some authors consider that the process of central coherence may be relatively independent of a theory of the mind. The research of Baron-Cohen et al. has concentrated on identifying existing neurological deficits or organic changes such as bilateral lesions or the role of testosterone on the quality of social interactions and the restrictive social interests of individuals with autism. A similar interest exists in researching the difference in perspective taking and empathy abilities exhibited by members of the opposite sex. Continuing with the neurological foundations of the empathy is of full present time the discoveries regarding «mirror neurons» and this recent study with monkeys proposes a specific cerebral area for the formation of the meta-representation. These neurons discharge both when the individual performs an action and when the individual observes another person performing the same action. Finally, even in the light of all the above, other sources point toward the social root of perspective taking skills. Additionally, as indicated by the research of Howlin, Baron-Cohen & Hadwin, it is considered perspective taking includes five different levels: a) simple visual perspective taking, b) the knowledge that different individuals can have separately the same thoughts, and c) understanding that "seeing leads to learning," followed by d) the ability to predict actions based on valid beliefs, and finally e) the ability to predict false beliefs. In the light of all of the above, once the radical conclusions of these investigations are viewed critically, the theory of the mind is viewed as a disputable theory of the delimitation of the cause and development of such skills. In addition, to the perspective taking tests themselves, the prerequisite skills of perspective taking need to be extensively analyzed. In fact, it has been shown that, in order to have an adequate performance on these tests of false beliefs, individuals should be able: 1. to remember and adequately retell their own past desires, thoughts, and past actions; 2. to retain an object in their mind, perceive a second object, and form a relationship between the two, as in a "symbolic function"; 3. to demonstrate the ability to pretend; and 4. to identify the role of age and verbal abilities in children as pre-requisites for an accurate performance on tests of false beliefs, and interpretations of the world. Lastly, we propose a pragmatic and complementary analysis the Theory of Mind based in the functional-contextual analysis of behavior. First, it is considered that perspective taking requires or is closely related to other social behaviors (such as taking turns when talking, initiating verbal responses in interpersonal relations, and the capacity for empathy). In the same manner, theory of mind requires an adequate level of simple and complex conditional discriminations, and these should be analyzed in terms of stimulus control and equivalence relations. In other words, this ability to infer thoughts, feeling, and emotions of others exists if the following pre-requisites are present: 1. the processes of the classical conditioning of the emotions, 2. a generalized imitation, and 3. the development of functional classes. Without these experiences or the capability to be affected by them, children (i.e. children with generalized autism) do not develop language adequately. Second, perspective taking implies that an observer's previous experiences and observations with certain events determine his/ her reaction to responses emitted by others in similar circumstances. Finally, from a contextual perspective, it is considered that a speaker's relational frames play a role in this process (for the discriminations I/you, here/there, now/later). These relational properties are abstracted through multiple exemplars or multiple learning opportunities to speak from one's own perspective in relation to others.},

	abstract = {Background Problems with reward system function have been posited as a primary difficulty in autism spectrum disorders. The current study examined an electrophysiological marker of feedback monitoring, the feedback-related negativity (FRN), during a monetary reward task. The study advanced prior understanding by focusing exclusively on a developmental sample, applying rigorous diagnostic characterization and introducing an experimental paradigm providing more subtly different feedback valence (reward versus non-reward instead of reward versus loss). Methods Twenty-six children with autism spectrum disorder and 28 typically developing peers matched on age and full-scale IQ played a guessing game resulting in monetary gain ("win") or neutral outcome ("draw"). ERP components marking early visual processing (N1, P2) and feedback appraisal (FRN) were contrasted between groups in each condition, and their relationship to behavioral measures of social function and dysfunction, social anxiety, and autism symptomatology were explored. Results FRN was observed on draw trials relative to win trials. Consistent with prior research, children with ASD exhibited a FRN to suboptimal outcomes that was comparable to typical peers. ERP parameters were unrelated to behavioral measures. Conclusions Results of the current study indicate typical patterns of feedback monitoring in the context of monetary reward in ASD. The study extends prior findings of normative feedback monitoring to a sample composed exclusively of children and demonstrates that, as in typical development, individuals with autism exhibit a FRN to suboptimal outcomes, irrespective of neutral or negative valence. Results do not support a pervasive problem with reward system function in ASD, instead suggesting any dysfunction lies in more specific domains, such as social perception, or in response to particular feedback-monitoring contexts, such as selfevaluation of one's errors. © 2012 McPartland et al.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of an educational board game for increasing knowledge, positive attitudes-beliefs, and self-efficacy for dengue prevention in a sample of Philippine school children and adolescents. Effective board games are more advantageous than lectures because they are adaptable, inexpensive and foster learning independently of teachers or lecturers. Also tested were relationships between perceived fun by students playing the game and outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - A school-based pre-test/post-test experimentally controlled design was employed in a Filipino primary and secondary school population. Findings - The lecture was more effective in increasing knowledge. But neither was more effective than the other in increasing positive attitudes-beliefs and self-efficacy. Both modes produced specifically significant increases in knowledge and self-efficacy; only the lecture produced significant increases in attitudes-beliefs. Also, there was a significant relationship between fun and self-efficacy in the game group at the reduced regression model level but not in the presence of all study variables. Research limitations/implications - No long term outcomes or behavioral change outcomes were measured. However, an educational game may increase knowledge and self-efficacy about the dengue fever without the assistance of a teacher or other pre-game instructional aids. In addition, the board game technique is flexible and easily adapted to other community or school health issues. Originality/value - This was the first experimentally controlled study on the use of a game with the topic of dengue. The study on the use of a game was the first to demonstrate a significant increase in self-efficacy as a result of the play of a board game. Original instruments measured self-efficacy related to dengue control and also the variable of fun. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Data were gathered from 2, 358 university students from across Greece. The prevalence of PIU was 34.7% in our sample, and PIU was significantly associated with gender, parental family status, grade of studies during the previous semester, staying or not with parents, enrollment of the student in an unemployment program, and whether the student paid a subscription to the Internet (p<0.0001). On average, problematic Internet users use MSN, forums, YouTube, pornographic sites, chat rooms, advertisement sites, Google, Yahoo!, their e-mail, ftp, games, and blogs more than non-problematic Internet users. PIU was also associated with other potential addictive personal habits of smoking, drinking alcohol or coffee, and taking drugs. Significant risk factors for PIU were being male, enrolment in unemployment programs, presence of negative beliefs, visiting pornographic sites, and playing online games. Thus PIU is prevalent among Greek university students and attention should be given to it by health officials. Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {Experiencing sexual coercion during adolescence can lead to adverse psychological and physical health outcomes for those affected. Eliminatingsuch experiences is important for enhancingadolescent wellbeing, and the provision of good quality relationships and sex education (RSE) is needed. Engaging young people in sensitive subjectmatters in RSE can be challenging, and using Serious Gaming technology may support young people and educators in this process. This paper describes the use of Intervention mapping (IM) in the development of a serious game on the topic of sexual coercion for use in RSE. IM is a process that draws on stakeholder engagement and the theory and evidence base to support health improvement intervention planning. Serious game developers transformed the game concept ‘flat plan’ into an interactive gameshow. The game is teacher ledand aims to engage students in gameplay and discussion around the issue of sexual coercion. The final product known as PR:EPARe (Positive Relationships: Eliminating Coercion and Pressure in Adolescent Relationships) is the subject of an ongoing cluster Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) in local schools. Early data analysis shows improvements in psychological preparedness for dealing with sexual coercion against some change objectives. This work represents the first attempt to use IM in the development of a Serious Game and the use of Serious Gaming for RSE delivery. RCT work is ongoing and PR:EPARe will become part of local RSE delivery in the new school year. Plans for ensuring broader impact of the game are in development. © 2012 Interactive Media Institute.},

	abstract = {The coastal site of Vale Boi is unique in southern Portugal for its well-preserved and lengthy Upper Paleolithic cultural record. The archaeological context of Vale Boi suggests that the site was treated as a seasonal residential camp. Long-term exploitation of marine resources is indicated by marine shellfish remains and tentative evidence of fishing. High-level exploitation of rabbits (Oryctolagus) began with the initial use of Vale Boi (c. 28,000 BP) and continued throughout the duration of site occupation. Intensive grease-rendering of ungulate bones is demonstrated by the presence of impact features, reduced presence of skeletal portions associated with increased quantities of bone grease and a significant correlation between the fragmentation of red deer (Cervus elaphus) remains and the quantities of marrow and bone grease within these portions. Although grease rendering at Vale Boi pre-dates other known sites in Eurasia by several thousand years, faunal assemblages in Mediterranean Spain suggest that resource diversification connected with intensification may have appeared there coevally with Vale Boi. The application of models of diet breadth and patch-choice suggests that southern Iberia may not have had the large and medium game to easily support human consumer demand. Instead, foragers may have had to turn to novel approaches of resource harvesting to maintain their needs. This set of circumstances may have arisen from a patchy landscape, where resources were either spatially and/or seasonally restricted. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

The objectives of this study were to understand current breast-feeding knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs among rural southern Appalachian adolescents and to explore whether a high school educational intervention designed to address the five tenets (knowledge, attitudes, intentions, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms) of the theory of planned behavior may be effective in increasing future rates of breast-feeding in this population. METHODS: An educational session including an interactive game was developed and administered to occupational health science students during a single class period in two county high schools. A presurvey and a postsurvey administered 2 weeks after the intervention were completed by students. Pre- and postsurveys were analyzed using paired t tests and Cohen d and potential differences based on sex and grade were explored. RESULTS: Both pre- and postsurveys were completed by 107 students (78%). Knowledge, attitudes about breast-feeding benefits, subjective norms, and intentions significantly improved following the intervention. Baseline knowledge and attitudes about breast-feeding benefits for mothers were low and demonstrated the greatest improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Offering breast-feeding education based on the theory of planned behavior in a single high school class session was effective in improving student knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about breast-feeding and intention to breast-feed.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study explores the relationship between instructional strategies and effective health education curricula. METHODS: A content analysis of 10 health education curricula was conducted to determine if they include common instructional strategies for actively engaging students in acquisition of health skills. To be included, the curricula had to (1) be research-based and proven via empirical testing to positively influence the health behaviors and (2) address 1 of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 6 priority health risk behaviors. RESULTS: Content analysis revealed 5 active learning strategies incorporated to involve students in acquiring health skills. Role play, group cooperation, and small group discussion were found in all 10 curricula. To a lesser extent, interactive technology and team games were also included. CONCLUSION: When combined with previous research regarding the characteristics of effective teachers, it becomes clear that effective health education is delivered by teachers who employ a wide repertoire of active learning strategies while devoting substantial instructional time to those specific strategies that involve students in skills practice. © 2011, American School Health Association.},

Basic research on expressive communication in music, gesture and dance has been focused by EU-IST-funded European researchers in psychology, technology and computer engineering. The output from this cooperation with artists has also revealed ideas and innovations for applications in social, artistic and communicative entertainment. However, even the most careful basic research and computer engineering could never estimate the real efficiency and benefit of such new expressive applications. The purpose of this article, therefore, is to get feedback from the audience and the artists/ performers/ players at three public MEGA events: the interactive music concert Allegoria dell'opinione verbale , a dance performance by Groove Machine and a public game ( Ghost in the Cave ). General attitude, perceived communication/affect and practical efficiency were evaluated by questionnaires. Results showed that: (a) the performers were able to control the expressive output within the application, (b) the audience was positive to each event, (c) information about or explicit engagement in the application revealed even more positive judgments, and (d) aesthetic and expressive qualities were transmitted through the MEGA output. This article suggests that real-time transmission of expressive and emotional content is very promising for social, artistic and communicative applications. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

We hypothesized that peer interaction reduces the activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that is required for self-regulation of reward-driven behavior. We also expected that mPFC activity would be reduced more in those with greater surgency, a composite trait of behavioral approach, sensation seeking and positive affect. In our study, 20 15-year-old boys played a simulated driving video game alone and in the presence of peers who were encouraged to call out advice while we recorded the feedback-related negativity (FRN) event-related potential in response to an impending car crash. FRN amplitude was reduced both as a function of peer presence and increased surgency. More importantly, we also calculated intracerebral current source density at the time of the FRNs, and found that both greater surgency and peer presence are associated with reduced activity specifically in the mPFC. Riskier performance resulting in more car crashes resulted from the presence of peers only as an interaction with surgency, this interaction being related strongly to reduced activity in the ventromedial PFC. © The Author (2011).

	abstract = {In this monograph, we ask whether various kinds of intellectual, physical, and social activities produce cognitive enrichment effects - that is, whether they improve cognitive performance at different points of the adult life span, with a particular emphasis on old age. We begin with a theoretical framework that emphasizes the potential of behavior to influence levels of cognitive functioning. According to this framework, the undeniable presence of age-related decline in cognition does not invalidate the view that behavior can enhance cognitive functioning. Instead, the course of normal aging shapes a zone of possible functioning, which reflects person-specific endowments and age-related constraints. Individuals influence whether they function in the higher or lower ranges of this zone by engaging in or refraining from beneficial intellectual, physical, and social activities. From this point of view, the potential for positive change, or plasticity, is maintained in adult cognition. It is an argument that is supported by newer research in neuroscience showing neural plasticity in various aspects of central nervous system functioning, neurochemistry, and architecture. This view of human potential contrasts with static conceptions of cognition in old age, according to which decline in abilities is fixed and individuals cannot slow its course. Furthermore, any understanding of cognition as it occurs in everyday life must make a distinction between basic cognitive mechanisms and skills (such as working-memory capacity) and the functional use of cognition to achieve goals in specific situations. In practice, knowledge and expertise are critical for effective functioning, and the available evidence suggests that older adults effectively employ specific knowledge and expertise and can gain new knowledge when it is required. We conclude that, on balance, the available evidence favors the hypothesis that maintaining an intellectually engaged and physically active lifestyle promotes successful cognitive aging. First, cognitive-training studies have demonstrated that older adults can improve cognitive functioning when provided with intensive training in strategies that promote thinking and remembering. The early training literature suggested little transfer of function from specifically trained skills to new cognitive tasks; learning was highly specific to the cognitive processes targeted by training. Recently, however, a new generation of studies suggests that providing structured experience in situations demanding executive coordination of skills - such as complex video games, task-switching paradigms, and divided attention tasks-train strategic control over cognition that does show transfer to different task environments. These studies suggest that there is considerable reserve potential in older adults' cognition that can be enhanced through training. Second, a considerable number of studies indicate that maintaining a lifestyle that is intellectually stimulating predicts better maintenance of cognitive skills and is associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in late life. Our review focuses on longitudinal evidence of a connection between an active lifestyle and enhanced cognition, because such evidence admits fewer rival explanations of observed effects (or lack of effects) than does cross-sectional evidence. The longitudinal evidence consistently shows that engaging in intellectually stimulating activities is associated with better cognitive functioning at later points in time. Other studies show that meaningful social engagement is also predictive of better maintenance of cognitive functioning in old age. These longitudinal findings are also open to important rival explanations, but overall, the available evidence suggests that activities can postpone decline, attenuate decline, or provide prosthetic benefit in the face of normative cognitive decline, while at the same time indicating that late-life cognitive changes can result in curtailment of activities. Given the complexity of the dynamic reciprocal relationships between stimulating activities and cognitive function in old age, additional research will be needed to address the extent to which observed effects validate a causal influence of an intellectually engaged lifestyle on cognition. Nevertheless, the hypothesis that an active lifestyle that requires cognitive effort has long-term benefits for older adults' cognition is at least consistent with the available data. Furthermore, new intervention research that involves multimodal interventions focusing on goal-directed action requiring cognition (such as reading to children) and social interaction will help to address whether an active lifestyle enhances cognitive function. Third, there is a parallel literature suggesting that physical activity, and aerobic exercise in particular, enhances older adults' cognitive function. Unlike the literature on an active lifestyle, there is already an impressive array of work with humans and animal populations showing that exercise interventions have substantial benefits for cognitive function, particularly for aspects of fluid intelligence and executive function. Recent neuroscience research on this topic indicates that exercise has substantial effects on brain morphology and function, representing a plausible brain substrate for the observed effects of aerobic exercise and other activities on cognition. Our review identifies a number of areas where additional research is needed to address critical questions. For example, there is considerable epidemiological evidence that stress and chronic psychological distress are negatively associated with changes in cognition. In contrast, less is known about how positive attributes, such as selfefficacy, a sense of control, and a sense of meaning in life, might contribute to preservation of cognitive function in old age. It is well known that certain personality characteristics such as conscientiousness predict adherence to an exercise regimen, but we do not know whether these attributes are also relevant to predicting maintenance of cognitive function or effective compensation for cognitive decline when it occurs. Likewise, more information is needed on the factors that encourage maintenance of an active lifestyle in old age in the face of elevated risk for physiological decline, mechanical wear and tear on the body, and incidence of diseases with disabling consequences, and whether efforts to maintain an active lifestyle are associated with successful aging, both in terms of cognitive function and psychological and emotional well-being. We also discuss briefly some interesting issues for society and public policy regarding cognitive-enrichment effects. For example, should efforts to enhance cognitive function be included as part of a general prevention model for enhancing health and vitality in old age?We also comment on the recent trend of business marketing interventions claimed to build brain power and prevent age-related cognitive decline, and the desirability of direct research evidence to back claims of effectiveness for specific products. © 2009 Association for Psychological Science.},

After a brief historical synopsis of the emergence of this young field, the most relevant findings related to the investigation of the neural networks underlying our capacity to understand the minds of others are summarized. More specifically, three routes of social cognition are distinguished: (1) our capacity to mentalize, or to infer intentions and beliefs of others, (2) our capacity to mimic and understand other's motor actions, and (3) our capacity to empathize, or to share and understand the feelings of others. More recent studies focusing on social emotions such as love, compassion, revenge or our sense of fairness will be discussed linking the field of social neuroscience to the even younger field of neuroeconomics, with the focus on the study of human social interactions using game theoretical paradigms. Finally, the use of a multi-method and multi-disciplinary research approach combining genetic, pharmacological, computational and developmental aspects is advocated and future directions for the study of interactive minds are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: The last decade has witnessed unprecedented growth in the number of mobile phones in the developing world, thus linking millions of previously unconnected people. The ubiquity of mobile phones, which allow for short message service (SMS), provides new and innovative opportunities for disease prevention efforts. Objective: The aim of this review was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of SMS interventions for disease prevention in developing countries and provide recommendations for future work. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed and gray literature was performed for papers published in English, French, and German before May 2011 that describe SMS applications for disease prevention in developing countries. Results: A total of 34 SMS applications were described, among which 5 had findings of an evaluation reported. The majority of SMS applications were pilot projects in various levels of sophistication; nearly all came from gray literature sources. Many applications were initiated by the project with modes of intervention varying between one-way or two-way communication, with or without incentives, and with educative games. Evaluated interventions were well accepted by the beneficiaries. The primary barriers identified were language, timing of messages, mobile network fluctuations, lack of financial incentives, data privacy, and mobile phone turnover. Conclusion: This review illustrates that while many SMS applications for disease prevention exist, few have been evaluated. The dearth of peer-reviewed studies and the limited evidence found in this systematic review highlight the need for high-quality efficacy studies examining behavioral, social, and economic outcomes of SMS applications and mobile phone interventions aimed to promote health in developing country contexts.},

A preliminary outcome study of SAHARA conducted at Planned Parenthood, Atlanta, found that SAHARA, when followed by a brief 20-minute wrap-up group session facilitated by a health educator, was effective in promoting consistent condom use for vaginal sex.

Whilst heterogeneity in experimental methods limits meta-analysis, we describe the advantages and limitations of different methodological approaches.

We revisit our original study of striatal DA release during video-game playing [Koepp, M.J., Gunn, R.N., Lawrence, A.D., Cunningham, V.J., Dagher, A., Jones, T., Brooks, D.J., Bench, C.J., Grasby, P.M., 1998.

Changes in [11C]raclopride binding may be detected in extrastriatal as well as striatal brain regions-however we review evidence which suggests that extrastriatal changes may not be clearly interpreted in terms of DA release. Whilst several investigations have detected increases in striatal extracellular DA concentrations during task components such as motor learning and execution, reward-related processes, stress and cognitive performance, the presence of potentially biasing factors should be carefully considered (and, where possible, accounted for) when designing and interpreting future studies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: People with intellectual disabilities (ID) have unequal access to health care. While systemic efforts are addressing health inequalities, there remains a need to demonstrate that persons with ID can increase their health self-advocacy skills. Method: A randomised control design with up to 6-month follow-up was used to evaluate the 3Rs (Rights, Respect and Responsibility) health self-advocacy training program for persons with ID (n=31). Training involved teaching participants to recognise and redress health rights violations in the context of respect and responsibility. Training materials included PowerPoint slides and interactive video scenarios illustrating health rights, respect and responsibility problem and non-problems. Two-hour training sessions were conducted twice a week in a group format where participants played a game and answered questions. Results: The health rights training group made significantly more correct responses on post training and follow-up tests than the control group. Training effects generalised to untrained scenarios and in situ health interviews. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that persons with ID can learn complex skills related to health self-advocacy. More research is needed to improve in situ generalisation. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In this study we rely on the functionalist perspective of human behavior and propose and test a balanced model of the antecedents of online game addiction among adolescents, which simultaneously focuses on motivating, and prevention and harm reduction forces. First, a sample of 163 adolescents was used for validating and refining a survey instrument. Second, survey data collected from 623 adolescents were analyzed with Partial Least Squares techniques. The findings point to several functional needs (e.g., need for relationship and need for escapism) that drive online game playing and addiction, as well as to several prevention and harm reduction factors (e.g., education, attention switching activities) that reduce game playing time and alleviate online game addiction. The effects of motivation and prevention factors on online game addiction are often partially mediated by online game playing.

These disorders are related to bad quality of life and usually coexist with other psychopathologic conditions. Some simple instruments for preliminary screening exist, such as the CAGE one for alcohol abuse, which has proven to be the most useful. The purpose of present paper is to evaluate the psychometric properties of a questionnaire, based on the CAGE structure, to detect the presence of these behaviours in a fast and reliable manner during consultation. Patients and method. Cross-sectional descriptive study, on two samples (413 patients of an urban Health Centre, and 117 of an Attention Centre for Drug Dependencies) selected by a consecutive nonprobabilistic sampling. Aquestionnaire named MULTICAGE-CAD-4 was applied, with 32 items that investigate eight scales (alcohol, drugs, pathological gambling, Internet, videogames, compulsive spending, eating and sex disorders). Results. Reliability shows satisfactory (Cronbach α > 0.7 for all the scales, test-retest correlation r = 0.89). Exploratory factorial analysis obtains an 8 components solution that fully identify the proposed structure. Diagnostic sensitivity for alcohol was 92.4%, and between 94 and 100% for heroin, cocaine and cannabis. Conclusions. Introducing an instrument of easy applicability during the consultation, with high reliability, validity and diagnostic sensitivity, which would help in the detection of potentially treatable problems.},

	abstract = {A longstanding hypothesis is that individuals who exhibit large increases in blood pressure during psychological stress are at risk for atherosclerosis. We tested whether blood pressure changes during psychological stress predict subsequent coronary calcification (CaC) in young healthy adults. We evaluated 2816 healthy black and white women, 20 to 35 years of age, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, who were not using medication for hypertension or diabetes in 1987-1988. Participants completed video game and star tracing tasks while their blood pressure was recorded. Thirteen years later (2000-2001), they completed computed tomography measures of CaC. Overall 9.3% (261 of 2816) had CaC present at follow-up. Each 10 mm Hg change in systolic blood pressure during the video game was associated with a 24% increased odds of having CaC at follow-up (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.46; P=0.008). This association persisted after adjustment for age, race, sex, education, smoking, alcohol, family history of myocardial infarction, smoking, daily alcohol consumption, body mass index, and resting or baseline blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.58; P=0.006). Blood pressure changes during the star tracing task were not associated with subsequent CaC. Blood pressure changes during a video game predicted the presence of CaC 13 years later. To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports blood pressure reactivity to a stressor being related to calcification in the coronary arteries.

Whole-body motion is a reliable, valid, easily perceived source of information about intentions because different kinds of intentional action have different motion signatures. In this study, we report four experiments that examined the ability of German adults, German children, and Shuar adults from Amazonian Ecuador to distinguish, on the basis of motion cues alone, between six categories of intentional interaction: Chasing, fighting, courting, following, guarding, and playing. Naturalistic motion trajectories were elicited from untutored participants in a game-like situation with performance-based monetary payoffs and were categorized by other participants in a forced-choice design. On a six-category task, German adults correctly categorized intention 75% of the time (where 17% represents chance performance). On a four-category judgment task, children's performance was above chance by age 4, with a mean of 64% correct. A final study compared the judgments of German adults with those of Shuar hunter-horticulturalists. Performance was identical and well above chance in both populations, suggesting that cognitive adaptations for inferring intention from motion deserve further research as possible universal components of human psychology. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The use of doping agents, once restricted to professional athletes, has nowadays become a problem of public health, since it also concerns young people and non-competing amateurs in different sports. The use is also diffused in social life for improving physical appearance and enhancing performance and even dietary supplements assumed to improve performance often contain anabolic steroids. While decades ago the so-called " classical doping agents" (like stimulants and narcotics) were used, to-day anabolic steroids are more widely diffused. Anabolic steroids are synthetic substances prepared by introducing modifications in the molecular structure of testosterone, the main natural androgenic anabolic steroid that forms in testes interstitial cells. The first report concerning the use of anabolic steroids by an athlete who searched for increased weight and power dates 1954. In 1974 the misuse of anabolic steroids in sports was banned by the International Olympic Committee and control tests were implemented in 1976 Montreal Olympic Games through radioimmunoassay analysis: the technique, however, only allows for unspecific detection of a limited number of exogenous steroids. Over the years, always new doping substances are synthesized and, as a consequence, the list of prohibited compounds is continuously updated and new suitable analytical methods for their detection and determination in biological matrices are continuously required. In doping control analysis the knowledge of steroid metabolism pathway in human body is of primary importance and the analytical methods must permit the simultaneous detection and determination not only of the forbidden precursor agents but also of their metabolites. In addition, the potential presence and amount in the biological samples of species that can interfere in the analysis should be evaluated. Also the several anabolic steroids, specifically designed to circumvent doping control, put on the market have been incorporated in the list of the prohibited substances of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). In WADA list steroids figure in three main classes, namely anabolic steroids, corticosteroids and substances with anti-estrogenic properties. It must be strongly reminded that assumption of doping agents not only leads to athletes the possible failing of doping tests but causes important health risk and WADA prohibited list establishes criteria to highlight the alteration of the natural steroid profile caused by exogenous administration. Doping control analyses are generally performed in urine, a matrix that provides a prolonged detection time window, and less often in blood, serum, plasma, hair, saliva, and nails. To identify the chemical structures of anabolic steroids the use of mass spectrometry detection is very advantageous. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques allowed for the development of comprehensive screening methods. GC-MS methods are sensitive and robust but present the disadvantages of time-consuming sample pretreatment, that is often based on hydrolysis and derivatisation reactions. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods have been successfully used to identify and determinate steroids in different matrices, as well as to study their metabolisms. Nowadays, automatic rapid ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) tandem mass spectrometry has become the technique of choice for steroid analysis. Due to its generally higher speed, sensitivity, reproducibility and specificity with respect to HPLC, it can be used to simultaneously separate and determinate multi component steroid mixtures. The technique is of huge interest to separate conjugates anabolic androgenic steroids, as it allows efficiency enhancement due to the small particle (sub-2. μm) column packing, which provides high peak capacity within analysis times even 5-10 fold shorter than conventional HPLC methods. Modern multiplex instruments can analyze thousands of samples per month so that, notwithstanding the generally high instrumental costs, the cost of the individual assay is affordable. In addition, the improved specificity and resolution offered by time-of-flight or quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry allow their application in doping control analysis or in steroid profiling for accurate and sensitive full mass range acquisition. Aim of the present review is to consider, compare and discuss the applications of the UHPLC/MS methods present in literature for the identification and determination of forbidden steroids and their metabolites in human biological matrices. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Most children, including lower socioeconomic status and ethnic minority children, play video games, use computers, and have cell phones, and growing numbers have smart phones and electronic tablets. They are comfortable with, even prefer, electronic media. Many expect to be entertained and have a low tolerance for didactic methods. Thus, health promotion with children needs to incorporate more interactive media. Interactive media for weight control and health promotion among children can be broadly classified into web-based educational/therapeutic programs, tailored motivational messaging systems, data monitoring and feedback systems, active video games, and diverse forms of interactive multimedia experiences involving games. This article describes the primary characteristics of these different technological methods; presents the strengths and weaknesses of each in meeting the needs of children of different ages; emphasizes that we are in the earliest stages of knowing how best to design these systems, including selecting the optimal requisite behavioral change theories; and identifies high-priority research issues. Gaming and technology offer many exciting, innovative opportunities for engaging children and promoting diet and physical activity changes that can contribute to obesity prevention and weight loss maintenance. Research needs to clarify optimal procedures for effectively promoting change with each change procedure. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) generate new styles of meeting people or connecting with friends or strangers. In this context, the internet and the mobile phone deserve special attention. This article deals with the maladaptive use of these technologies. By reviewing the literature published between 1991 and 2005 and indexed in the databases of PsycINFO, Medline, Psicodoc, IME, and ISOC, we aim to determine whether maladaptive use of these technologies can be considered a mental disorder, and if so, of which type. We describe the psychological phenomena of maladaptive use of the internet and mobile phones, we review research on prevalence and possible risk groups, and finally we discuss some of the criticisms made with regard to the existence and classification of this disorder. It is concluded that excessive use of the internet can lead to a mental disorder of the addictive type, which can particularly affect individuals with special emotional needs, as well as adolescents and young adults. Among specific applications of the internet, a major risk is found for the use of communicative and synchronic applications, such as chats and online role games, since they permit hyperpersonal communication, playing with different identities, and projections and dissociation without consequences in real life. Furthermore, the internet can play an important role in the development and maintenance of other addictions, such as pathological gambling and sex addiction. In contrast to the case of the internet, maladaptive use of mobile phones may be considered abuse, but not addiction, since their use does not lead to the rapid emotional changes or the playing with identities that can take place in chats and online role games.},

Setting: Data were collected at community agencies or during home visits. Participants: Low-income, European American and African American mothers (N = 155). Intervention: Participants were exposed to nutrition education material in 1 of 3 modalities (a computer game, The Fantastic Food Challenge; Web site; or pamphlet). Likeability, nutrition knowledge, intention to use, and demographic measures followed the intervention at T1 and T2. Main Outcome Measures: 5-point Likert-type scales measured likeability (5 items), and 33 multiple-choice questions measured knowledge. Analysis: Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) procedures using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) software, P < .05. Results: Overall, the Web site was liked more than the other conditions with this audience of women. Significant differences in attention, understanding, and intent to use the information existed across modalities. The Web site performed better than other modalities on knowledge outcomes, with no differences in knowledge retention from T1 toT2. Conclusions and Implications: The Web site modality performed best with this audience of women, indicating that interactive computer games may not confer greater benefits than traditional modes of information delivery for all audiences, particularly those with low computer skills. © 2008 SOCIETY FOR NUTRITION EDUCATION.},

	abstract = {One target of psychology of health is the quest for specificity when detecting factors related to psychological disorders, among which there are female sexual dysfunctions showing associated pain: dyspareunia and vaginismus (not caused by medical disease). Dyspareunia is the presence of genital pain during sexual intercourse and is related to psychological or relational factors. Vaginismus is characterized by spasms in the muscles of the vaginal entrance, making it difficult or impossible to perform coitus; the woman can be sexually aroused, responsive and enjoying sexual games, she can even reach her orgasm, as long as there is no penetration. Of all the causes mentioned, the following are recognized: incapacity to let go to the erotic experience, fear to failure, cultural influence predisposing sexual conflict, anxiety and shame, as well as couple problems. However, specificity is lacking in the factors related to each one of these sexual dysfunctions in order to provide elements generating intervention strategies. Objective: The objective is to detect new indicators with the purpose of having a better understanding of why an individual exercises sexuality in such a way that it makes her have a proper sexual response and why, in other situations, the sexual response shows alterations leading to dyspareunia or vaginismus. Four are the specific objectives: 1. Identification of current indicators that have an influence in sexual dysfunctions of the participants. 2. Identification of indicators that have had an influence in the unsatisfactory development of sexuality of the participants. 3. Identification of elements of perception of the participants in the couple life of their parents that may have had an impact on their sexuality. 4. Identification of indicators that, within the sexual management provided by the family, had an impact in the sexual life of the participants. Material and methods: The qualitative-interpretative method was used, in the form of an exploratory case-study. The institution where the study took place was the Department of Psychology of the National Institute of Perinatology (INPerIER). The sample was constituted by three participants, all of them patients from the institution; they had to comply with certain inclusion criteria of the study. Any physical problem that could have caused the sexual dysfunction was discarded. The first participant did not show any sexual dysfunction (NSD), the second one showed dyspareunia (D) and the third one showed vaginismus (V). We used a semi-structured, focalized, in-depth interview. Interviews took place after having signed a letter of informed consent, accordingly to the ethical institutional requirements, and we also got an approval of recording the interview. We used the analysis of content with an empiric, exploratory orientation. Categories were organized accordingly with the specific objectives. Results: The three participants were: NSD: 32 years old, five years of marriage. No sexual dysfunction. V: 36 years old, six years of marriage. Diagnosis: vaginismus. D: 33 years old, one year in free union. Diagnosis: dyspareunia. Data systematization was performed dividing the units of analysis by every participant and the parts of the most significative stories of every specific objective within its respective categories. In the analysis of categories we detected two conditions: internal and relational, as well as two types of indicators: risk indicators and protective indicators. What marked the difference was the dominium of the protective indicators over the risk indicators in the NSD participant. Among the more important risk indicators, we found feelings of disadvantage, uselessness and devaluating feelings, linked to a tendency to submissive behavior, as a consequence of remote causes such as having faced a double moral in the family: on the one hand erotized family bonds during infancy and, on the other hand, prohibitions and stiffness towards any sexual curiosity or manifestation, apart from a poor socialization. The conflict between desire and sexual prohibition generates confusion in the identification of sensations, setting a painful, fearful association to sexuality, even more so if this landscape is complicated with other elements such as violence and carelessness. Other elements found as a consequence of the aforementioned include self-inflicted violence, annulment of desire, lack of self-care and interacting problems with the opposite sex in everyday life. All of this leads to an incapacity of exerting a satisfactory sexual life, drifting towards secondary fears when feeling disadvantageous while interacting with the couple; this, in great extent, determines the conflicts, which may be either a cause or a consequence of the sexual problem. Confusion also arises when trying to identify whether problems are internal or external, thence conductual responses tend to complicate the relationship. In both sexual dysfunctions we find a specific type of frustration, since desire, excitement and orgasm are present, but coitus cannot be performed in a satisfactory way. The following are the more important protective indicators: conductual assertive responses, clarity in the affections, situation of the problems, search for sexual information, openness to family communication and with the couple, a couple's differential place, plus the search of satisfaction of sexuality and self care. Among the indicators shared we found: limited or null sexual education, poor communication in the family nucleus, and gender stereotypes highly polarized between parents, among others. Conclusions: We corroborate in this study that it is the combination of specific elements which contributes to the presence of these two sexual dysfunctions, since the psychological world has many intertwined streams, intervention models cannot be centered only in sexual techniques, but they should also consider the indicators related to such alterations. Finally, it must be pointed out that the results of this phase are the product of an exploratory study, opening the gates to new lines of research.},

	abstract = {Objective: To use ecological momentary assessment techniques to measure the association of major depressive disorder (MDD) with media use. Design: Data were collected using an ecological momentary assessment protocol with cellular telephone - based brief interviews. Setting: Participants received as many as 60 telephone calls from a trained staff member during 5 extendedweekends in an 8-week period. Participants: One hundred six adolescent participants who were part of a larger neurobehavioral study of depression in Pittsburgh from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2008. Main Exposure: At each call, participants were asked whether they were using the following 5 types of media: television or movies, music, video games, Internet, and print media, such as magazines, newspapers, and books. Main Outcome Measures: We developed multivariable models to determine the independent association of each type of media use with MDD, controlling for sociodemographic variables. Results: Of the 106 participants, 46 were diagnosed as having MDD. In multivariable models controlling for age, sex, and race, each increasing quartile of audio use was associated with an 80% increase in the odds of having MDD (odds ratio,1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.8; P=.01 for trend). Conversely, each increasing quartile of print media use was associated with a 50% decrease in the odds of having MDD (odds ratio,0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.9; P=.009 for trend). Conclusions: Major depressive disorder is positively associated with popular music exposure and negatively associated with reading print media such as books. Further research elucidating the directionality and strength of these relationships may help advance understanding of the relationships between media use and MDD. ©2011 American Medical Association.

Recent attempts to synthesize models of social selection with equations for indirect genetic effects (McGlothlin et al. 2010) provide a broad theoretical base from which to study selection and evolutionary response in the context of social interactions. However, this framework concludes that social selection will lead to evolution only if the traits carried by social partners are nonrandomly associated. I suggest this conclusion is incomplete, and that traits that do not covary between social partners can nevertheless lead to evolution via interactive effects on fitness. Such effects occur when there are functional interactions between traits, and as an example I use the interplay in water striders (Gerridae) between grasping appendages carried by males and spines by females. Functional interactive effects between traits can be incorporated into both the equations for social selection and the general model of social evolution proposed by McGlothlin et al. These expanded equations would accommodate adaptive coevolution in social interactions, integrate the quantitative genetic approach to social evolution with game theoretical approaches, and stimulate some new questions about the process of social evolution. © 2011 The Author.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Waist circumference (W) has been shown to be a good predictor of cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to investigate whether physical activity (PA) is related to W in adolescents as previously shown in adults. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Cross-sectional population-based survey of 2714 12-y-old adolescents from the eastern part of France. MEASUREMENTS: Body mass index (BMI) and W were measured. Structured PA, active commuting to and from school and sedentary activities (SED), for example television viewing, computer/video games and reading and different potential confounders (dietary habits, parental overweight, family annual income tax and educational level) were assessed by a questionnaire. RESULTS: The adolescents had a mean BMI of 19.0 ± 3.4 kg/m2, and 20.2% of them were overweight, with no gender difference. Boys had a greater W than girls (67.6 ± 9.1 vs 65.7 ± 8.9 cm, P < 0.0001). In all, 42% of the girls and 25% of the boys did not practice any structured PA outside school and less than 40% of the adolescents commuted actively to school more than 20 min/day. About one-third of the adolescents devoted more than 2 h/day to SED. In univariate analyses, BMI was negatively associated with structured PA but significantly only for girls (P < 0.01) and positively associated with SED for both genders (P < 0.0001 for girls, P < 0.01 for boys). W was negatively associated with structured PA and positively associated with SED both in girls (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.03, respectively) and boys (P < 0.01 and P = 0.08, respectively). Multiple general linear models show that SED is associated with BMI, independently of structured PA, in both genders. On the other hand, structured PA was inversely associated with W, independently of SED. The inverse relation between structured PA and W persisted after additional adjustment on BMI, with a greater effect of PA for the adolescents with higher BMI. CONCLUSIONS: In 12-y-old adolescents, structured PA is inversely associated with W, an indicator of total adiposity but also more specifically of abdominal fat. This suggests that PA may have a beneficial effect on youth metabolic and cardiovascular risks, in particular in the presence of overweight.},

While several studies have informed the development of technology-based interventions targeting mainstream youth, no such data have been reported for AI/AN youth. To fill this gap, this study quantified media technology use among 405 AI/AN youth (13-21 years old) living in tribes and urban communities in the Pacific Northwest, and identified patterns in their health information-seeking practices and preferences. Overall, technology use was exceptionally common among survey respondents, mirroring or exceeding national rates. High rates of online health information seeking were also reported: Over 75% of AI/AN youth reported searching online for health information. These data are now being used by the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and NW tribes to design culturally-appropriate, technology-based health interventions targeting AI/AN youth. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Ecological systems are complex assemblies of large numbers of individuals, interacting competitively under multifaceted environmental conditions. Recent studies using microbial laboratory communities have revealed some of the self-organization principles underneath the complexity of these systems. A major role of the inherent stochasticity of its dynamics and the spatial segregation of different interacting species into distinct patterns has thereby been established. It ensures the viability of microbial colonies by allowing for species diversity, cooperative behavior and other kinds of "social" behavior. A synthesis of evolutionary game theory, nonlinear dynamics, and the theory of stochastic processes provides the mathematical tools and a conceptual framework for a deeper understanding of these ecological systems. We give an introduction into the modern formulation of these theories and illustrate their effectiveness focussing on selected examples of microbial systems. Intrinsic fluctuations, stemming from the discreteness of individuals, are ubiquitous, and can have an important impact on the stability of ecosystems. In the absence of speciation, extinction of species is unavoidable. It may, however, take very long times. We provide a general concept for defining survival and extinction on ecological time-scales. Spatial degrees of freedom come with a certain mobility of individuals. When the latter is sufficiently high, bacterial community structures can be understood through mapping individual-based models, in a continuum approach, onto stochastic partial differential equations. These allow progress using methods of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcation analysis and invariant manifolds. We conclude with a perspective on the current challenges in quantifying bacterial pattern formation, and how this might have an impact on fundamental research in non-equilibrium physics. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Ninety-one adolescents with an ASD and their parents completed mail-based surveys during the summer months. Adolescents with an ASD identified more friends than did their parents, but they agreed on the friends' characteristics. About half of the adolescents spent an average of 4 hours per day with friends during the summer months. Male adolescents with an ASD most frequently played video games with friends, whereas females most frequently had conversations with friends. The findings suggest that adolescents with an ASD and their parents identify different peers as the adolescent's friends. The findings also reveal similarities and differences in friendships between adolescents with an ASD and typically developing adolescents. © The Author(s) 2011.},

	abstract = {Background: Video games have received widespread application in health care for distraction and behavior modification therapy. Studies on the effect of cognitive distraction during the preoperative period are lacking. We evaluated the efficacy of an interactive distraction, a hand-held video game (VG) in reducing preoperative anxiety in children. Methods: In a randomized, prospective study of 112 children aged 4-12 years undergoing outpatient surgery, anxiety was assessed after admission and again at mask induction of anesthesia, using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS). Postoperative behavior changes were assessed with the Posthospital Behavior Questionnaire (PHBQ). Patients were randomly assigned to three groups: parent presence (PP), PP + a hand-held VG, and PP + 0.5 mg·kg-1 oral midazolam (M) given >20 min prior to entering the operating room. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in anxiety (P < 0.01) in groups M and PP at induction of anesthesia compared with baseline, but not in VG group. VG patients demonstrated a decrease in anxiety from baseline (median change in mYPAS -3), the difference compared with PP (+11.8) was significant (P = 0.04). The change in anxiety in the M group (+7.3) was not statistically different from other groups. Sixty-three percent of patients in VG group had no change or decrease in anxiety after treatment, compared with 26% in M group and 28% in PP group (P = 0.01). There was no difference in anxiety changes between female and male patients. Conclusions: A hand-held VG can be offered to most children as a low cost, easy to implement, portable, and effective method to reduce anxiety in the preoperative area and during induction of anesthesia. Distraction in a pleasurable and familiar activity provides anxiety relief, probably through cognitive and motor absorption. © 2006 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Research on violent television and films, video games, and music reveals unequivocal evidence that media violence increases the likelihood of aggressive and violent behavior in both immediate and long-term contexts. The effects appear larger for milder than for more severe forms of aggression, but the effects on severe forms of violence are also substantial (r = 0.13 to 0.32) when compared with effects of other violence risk factors or medical effects deemed important by the medical community (e.g., effect of aspirin on heart attacks). The research base is large; diverse in methods, samples, and media genres; and consistent in overall findings. The evidence is clearest within the most extensively researched domain, television and film violence. The growing body of video-game research yields essentially the same conclusions. Short-term exposure increases the likelihood of physically and verbally aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, and aggressive emotions. Recent large-scale longitudinal studies provide converging evidence linking frequent exposure to violent media in childhood with aggression later in life, including physical assaults and spouse abuse. Because extremely violent criminal behaviors (e.g., forcible rape, aggravated assault, homicide) are rare, new longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to estimate accurately how much habitual childhood exposure to media violence increases the risk for extreme violence. Well-supported theory delineates why and when exposure to media violence increases aggression and violence. Media violence produces short-term increases by priming existing aggressive scripts and cognitions, increasing physiological arousal, and triggering an automatic tendency to imitate observed behaviors. Media violence produces long-term effects via several types of learning processes leading to the acquisition of lasting (and automatically accessible) aggressive scripts, interpretational schemas, and aggression-supporting beliefs about social behavior, and by reducing individuals' normal negative emotional responses to violence (i.e., desensitization). Certain characteristics of viewers (e.g., identification with aggressive characters), social environments (e.g., parental influences), and media content (e.g., attractiveness of the perpetrator) can influence the degree to which media violence affects aggression, but there are some inconsistencies in research results. This research also suggests some avenues for preventive intervention (e.g., parental supervision, interpretation, and control of children's media use). However, extant research on moderators suggests that no one is wholly immune to the effects of media violence. Recent surveys reveal an extensive presence of violence in modern media. Furthermore, many children and youth spend an inordinate amount of time consuming violent media. Although it is clear that reducing exposure to media violence will reduce aggression and violence, it is less clear what sorts of interventions will produce a reduction in exposure. The sparse research literature suggests that counterattitudinal and parental-mediation interventions are likely to yield beneficial effects, but that media literacy interventions by themselves are unsuccessful. Though the scientific debate over whether media violence increases aggression and violence is essentially over, several critical tasks remain. Additional laboratory and field studies are needed for a better understanding of underlying psychological processes, which eventually should lead to more effective interventions. Large-scale longitudinal studies would help specify the magnitude of media-violence effects on the most severe types of violence. Meeting the larger societal challenge of providing children and youth with a much healthier media diet may prove to be more difficult and costly, especially if the scientific, news, public policy, and entertainment communities fail to educate the general public about the real risks of media-violence exposure to children and youth. © 2003, Association for Psychological Science.

	abstract = {Background: Alcohol misuse is more common in persons with a family history of alcoholism (FH+) than in those with no such history (FH-). Among FH+, behavioral disinhibition and male sex seem to signal the presence of an increased risk. Methods: This study examined cognitive and behavioral characteristics of 175 nonabusing 18- to 30-year-olds, 87 FH+ and 88 FH-, who were further characterized by their degree of behavioral disinhibition using the Sociability scale of the California Personality Inventory. Working memory and decision making were tested using the Stroop Color-Word Test and the Iowa Gambling Task, a simulated card game. Results: Persons with a family history of alcoholism who were behaviorally disinhibited displayed significantly greater interference on the Stroop task than the other subgroups. On the Iowa Gambling Task, FH+ males, but not the females, were significantly more attentive to financial gains than other subgroups, and they had greater consistency in their choice behaviors. Conclusions: Persons with a family history of alcoholism, in combination with behavioral disinhibition, appears to signal working memory deficits and in combination with male sex indicates an attraction to the rewarding aspects of a risk-taking challenge. These findings are not secondary to heavy exposure to alcohol or other drugs, but instead reflect intrinsic risk-related familial and personal characteristics of the subjects.

	abstract = {Social exclusion inherently involves an element of expectancy violation, in that we expect other people to follow the unwritten rule to include us in social interactions. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we employed a unique modification of an interactive virtual ball-tossing game called "Cyberball" (Williams et al., 2000) and a novel paradigm called "Cybershape," in which rules are broken in the absence of social exclusion, to dissociate brain regions that process social exclusion from rule violations more generally. Our Cyberball game employed an alternating block design and removed evoked responses to events when the participant was throwing the ball in inclusion to make this condition comparable to exclusion, where participants did not throw. With these modifications, we replicated prior findings of ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), insula, and posterior cingulate cortex activity evoked by social exclusion relative to inclusion. We also identified exclusion-evoked activity in the hippocampi, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and left middle temporal gyrus. Comparing social exclusion and rule violation revealed a functional dissociation in the active neural systems as well as differential functional connectivity with vACC. Some overlap was observed in regions differentially modulated by social exclusion and rule violation, including the vACC and lateral parietal cortex. These overlapping brain regions showed different activation during social exclusion compared to rule violation, each relative to fair play. Comparing activation patterns to social exclusion and rule violation allowed for the dissociation of brain regions involved in the experience of exclusion versus expectancy violation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

This study evaluated the impact of SBW on pain, mood, anger, loneliness, problem behavior, and willingness to return for treatment of children receiving outpatient treatment at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). To test the hypothesis that SBW provides benefit through distraction, a restricted alternating treatments design was utilized to measure anger, pain, and mood. To test the more long-term benefits of SBW, loneliness and problem behavior were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Willingness to return was measured at each hospital visit made during the study. Process information was also collected during each SBW session (e.g., ease of use, frustration, and general enjoyment of the system). Thirty-two children participating in pediatric clinical trials at the NIH and their caregivers participated in the study. Seventy-eight percent of participants, ages 8 to 19 years, were HIV infected and the remaining 22% had varied, but potentially life-threatening, illnesses. Children reported significantly less loneliness and were significantly more willing to return to the hospital for treatment from baseline to follow-up. They were marginally less worried after using SBW than after using the regular playroom. Parents reported that their children experienced significantly less withdrawn behavior and needed significantly less help with both anxiety and resistance in returning to the hospital for treatment after using SBW. They also reported that SBW helped their children to feel decreases in loneliness and depressed mood, and increases in energetic mood. SBW is a potentially useful tool to improve the hospital experience for seriously ill children, reduce their feelings of loneliness and isolation, and help them to be less socially withdrawn.},

Responses to items about social norms of HIV risk behavior were also somewhat improved (p =.09). Subjects rated most program features highly.

Design: This phase II study was designed to estimate the efficacy and feasibility of a small scale, randomised, controlled intervention. Setting and subjects: This study, addressing youths aged 15-18 years, was implemented in four intervention and five control grocery stores that had an average of 44 eligible teens. Interventions: The tobacco use cessation and prevention interventions were based on social influences and peer leader models. Employee break rooms served as centres both for interactive activities including open houses, teen advisory boards, peer leader interviews, games and contests; and non-interactive interventions including bulletin boards and table tents with health messages and home mailings. Main process measures: Project staff collected process data on the extent of implementation of intervention activities, participation rates in activities, and contacts with peer leaders. On the final survey, teens reported on awareness of, participation in, and motivation for participating in project activities. Results: Indicators of feasibility were identified and discussed, including the number of activities implemented, teen participation, management support, cost, and barriers to and facilitators of implementation. During the 12 month intervention, a mean of 24.1 interactive activities and 55.3 non-interactive activities were implemented, and a mean 14.2% participation rate per activity per site was achieved. Eighty four per cent of teens reported being aware of SMART, and 39% reported participating in interactive and 67% in non-interactive activities. Conclusions: Teen smoking cessation rates in worksite programmes might be improved if they are conducted in companies where there is job stability and if teen programmes are part of worksite-wide tobacco control programmes that include both teens and adults.},

Method A computer-based quiz, an information poster, an interactive board game and a take-home information leaflet on HIV/AIDS were developed by final year pharmacy students under supervision, as part of an exhibit during the 2009 National Festival of Science and Technology (SciFest) held in Grahamstown, South Africa. Predominantly school learners took part in the quiz and other educational activities. Results The majority (53.1%) of the 179 junior quiz participants were male learners and the majority (63.6%) of the 253 senior quiz participants were female learners. Results of the pre-intervention scores demonstrate fair knowledge of HIV/AIDS with 64.5% and 71.3% for the junior and senior school participants, respectively. Educational interventions resulted in improvement in the number of correct answers to some of the questions. The results showed significant gender differences for the pre- and post-intervention mean percentage scores among the junior quiz participants and only in the pre-intervention scores of the senior quiz participants. Conclusion The health promotion elective was successful in raising awareness of HIV/AIDS but continuous, concerted health promotion activities and advocacy by all health care professionals is needed to address the prevention of HIV/AIDS.},

	abstract = {Objective: Fire is a leading cause of unintentional injury and, although young children are at particularly increased risk, there are very few evidence-based resources available to teach them fire safety knowledge and behaviors. Using a pre-post randomized design, the current study evaluated the effectiveness of a computer game (The Great Escape) for teaching fire safety information to young children (3.5-6 years). Method: Using behavioral enactment procedures, children's knowledge and behaviors related to fire safety were compared to a control group of children before and after receiving the intervention. Results: The results indicated significant improvements in knowledge and fire safety behaviors in the intervention group but not the control. Conclusion: Using computer games can be an effective way to promote young children's understanding of safety and how to react in different hazardous situations. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},
