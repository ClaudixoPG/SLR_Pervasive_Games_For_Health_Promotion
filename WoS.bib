Title = {Hot, horny and healthy-online intervention to incentivize HIV and
   sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing among young Mexican MSM: a
   feasibility study},
Journal = {MHEALTH},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Background: Encouraging Mexican men who have sex with men (MSM) to learn
   about and get tested for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) is
   essential not only to initiate early treatment and reduce complications
   related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) but also to avoid
   new infections. HIV testing for MSM in Mexico remains a challenge, in
   part because of the stigma and discrimination they face in their daily
   lives and perceived discrimination in health care services. Thus,
   innovative approaches are needed to increase the uptake of health
   prevention services among this population. Games for health and
   gamification are now established approaches to achieving desired
   behavior change. Gamified interventions have been successfully deployed
   in various health domains, including HIV awareness, treatment, and
   prevention. The aim of this 2015 study was to develop a phone-based game
   and linked online platform with gamification elements to incentivize HIV
   and sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing, normalize asking
   partners about serostatus, and increase HIV and STI knowledge among
   young Mexican MSM. This paper describes its implementation process and
   feasibility assessment.
   Methods: The study consisted of three phases. The first phase was the
   formative research, which consisted of 6 focus groups and rapid
   prototyping to determine the most effective and appropriate design for
   the intervention. The second phase consisted of piloting and
   implementing the intervention over five weeks among 62 MSM, aged between
   18 and 35 years old. Lastly, we assessed the feasibility of the
   intervention over three dimensions: acceptability, demand, and
   implementation. We conducted ten semi-structured interviews with
   participants and used a mixed-methods approach, including qualitative
   and quantitative evaluation methods.
   Results: Overall, the conceptual components of the intervention were
   perceived as acceptable, which leads us to believe that the formative
   phase captured our participants' needs and perceptions. However, we
   underestimated the complexity of the technical challenges involved.
   Participants' high standards and expectations of an interactive product
   based on their experience with industrially produced games impacted
   their patterns of use. Nevertheless, they perceived the platform as a
   good-quality information source. Gamification elements such as badges,
   points, and prizes were perceived as fun, exciting, and motivating, and
   71\% of participants engaged in at least one activity to earn points.
   Conclusions: A game-based intervention, coupled with an online platform
   that incorporates gamification elements to motivate HIV and STI testing
   in young Mexican MSM is feasible. Successfully scaling such an
   intervention to a broader audience would require reducing the complexity
   of the intervention, working with a local technical partner to develop
   and implement a more efficient platform, improving the quality of the
   graphics, and a re-design of the point system.},

Title = {Application of the HIV prevention cascade to identify, develop and
   evaluate interventions to improve use of prevention methods: examples
   from a study in east Zimbabwe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Introduction: The HIV prevention cascade could be used in developing
   interventions to strengthen implementation of efficacious HIV prevention
   methods, but its practical utility needs to be demonstrated. We propose
   a standardized approach to using the cascade to guide identification and
   evaluation of interventions and demonstrate its feasibility for this
   purpose through a project to develop interventions to improve HIV
   prevention methods use by adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and
   potential male partners in east Zimbabwe.
   Discussion: We propose a six-step approach to using a published generic
   HIV prevention cascade formulation to develop interventions to increase
   motivation to use, access to and effective use of an HIV prevention
   method. These steps are as follows: (1) measure the HIV prevention
   cascade for the chosen population and method; (2) identify gaps in the
   cascade; (3) identify explanatory factors (barriers) contributing to
   observed gaps; (4) review literature to identify relevant theoretical
   frameworks and interventions; (5) tailor interventions to the local
   context; and (6) implement and evaluate the interventions using the
   cascade steps and explanatory factors as outcome indicators in the
   evaluation design. In the Zimbabwe example, steps 1-5 aided development
   of four interventions to overcome barriers to effective use of
   pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in AGYW (15-24 years) and voluntary
   medical male circumcision in male partners (15-29). For young men,
   prevention cascade analyses identified gaps in motivation and access as
   barriers to voluntary medical male circumcision uptake, so an
   intervention was designed including financial incentives and an
   education session. For AGYW, gaps in motivation (particularly lack of
   risk perception) and access were identified as barriers to PrEP uptake:
   an interactive counselling game was developed addressing these barriers.
   A text messaging intervention was developed to improve PrEP adherence
   among AGYW, addressing reasons underlying lack of effective PrEP use
   through improving the capacity ({''}skills{''}) to take PrEP
   effectively. A community-led intervention (community conversations) was
   developed addressing community-level factors underlying gaps in
   motivation, access and effective use. These interventions are being
   evaluated currently using outcomes from the HIV prevention cascade (step
   6).
   Conclusions: The prevention cascade can guide development and evaluation
   of interventions to strengthen implementation of HIV prevention methods
   by following the proposed process.},

Title = {Is Fun For Wellness Engaging? Evaluation of User Experience of an Online
   Intervention to Promote Well-Being and Physical Activity},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {Online well-being interventions demonstrate great promise in terms of
   both engagement and outcomes. Fun For Wellness (FFW) is a novel online
   intervention grounded in self-efficacy theory and intended to improve
   multidimensional well-being and physical activity through multi-modal
   methods. These strategies include capability-enhancing opportunities,
   learning experiences such as games, video vignettes, and
   self-assessments. RCT studies have suggested that FFW is efficacious in
   improving subjective and domain-specific well-being, and effective in
   improving mental health, physical health, physical activity, and
   self-efficacy in United States. adults who are overweight and in the
   general population. The present study uses qualitative and quantitative
   user experience data collected during two RCT trials to understand and
   evaluate engagement with FFW, its drivers, and its outcomes. Results
   suggest that FFW is enjoyable, moderately engaging, and easy to use; and
   contributes to positive outcomes including skill development and
   enhanced confidence, for both overweight individuals and the general
   adult population. Drivers of engagement appear to include rewards,
   gamification, scenario-based learning, visual tracking for
   self-monitoring, ease of use and simple communications, and the
   entertaining, interactive nature of program activities. Findings
   indicate that there are opportunities to streamline and simplify the
   experience. These results can help improve FFW and contribute to the
   science of engagement with online interventions designed to improve
   well-being.},

Title = {Cognitive-behavioral intervention via interactive multimedia online
   video game for active aging: study protocol for a randomized controlled
   trial},
Journal = {TRIALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {Background: Due to the progressive aging of the population, programs to
   promote active aging have been recommended. However, older adults have
   difficulty accessing them. Interventions administered through online
   video games may increase their accessibility, and complementing these
   with a smartphone app will likely increase adherence and allow for
   ongoing professional monitoring. The objective of this study is to
   evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral intervention for active
   aging administered through an online interactive multimedia video game
   that includes a smartphone app companion. The secondary objectives are
   to analyze the moderators and mediators of the change in the outcome
   variables and to evaluate the adherence to the intervention.
   Methods/design: A randomized controlled clinical trial will be
   conducted. Adults 45 years and older will be randomly assigned to a
   cognitive-behavioral intervention administered through an online
   multimedia video game that includes a smartphone app companion or to a
   control group that will receive online information on active aging (274
   participants per group). The intervention will be administered in eight
   weekly 45-min modules. An investigator-blinded evaluation will be
   conducted using online self-administered tests at baseline,
   post-intervention, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. The primary outcome
   will be mental health status as evaluated using the 36-item Short-Form
   Health Survey ( SF-36) at post-intervention. Secondary outcomes will be
   emotional well- being, depressive symptoms, reinforcement, negative
   thoughts, self-reported memory, cognitive task performance, sleep
   hygiene behaviors, physical activity, eating habits, body mass index,
   social support, dropout, treatment adherence, and satisfaction with the
   intervention. Discussion: If the results are favorable, this study would
   involve the development of the first evidence-based active aging
   promotion intervention based on a video game that includes a smartphone
   app companion, providing evidence on its efficacy, accessibility, and
   clinical utility.},

   Intervention for Men Who Have Sex With Men and Hijras in Mumbai:
   Qualitative Study},
Journal = {JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {227-234},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: As Internet and mobile phone use expands in India, there is
   an opportunity to develop mobile health (mHealth) interventions for
   marginalized populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM) and
   hijras (transgender women), hesitant to access traditional health care
   systems.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if an mHealth
   intervention was acceptable to MSM and hijras living in Mumbai, and if
   so, what features would be useful in targeting the prevention of HIV
   acquisition and to increase the quality of life among persons living
   with HIV/AIDS.
   Methods: Data from 4 focus groups with MSM and interviews with 4 hijras,
   10 health service providers, and 8 mHealth developers were thematically
   analyzed.
   Results: Once the need for an mHealth intervention was confirmed,
   comments about features were organized into 3 themes: content,
   interface, and retention. Content subthemes included providing sex
   education for younger community members, providing information about
   STIs, and providing information and social support for persons living
   with HIV. Interface subthemes included presenting content using
   pictures; using videos to present stories of role models; using push
   notifications for testing, appointment, and medication reminders; using
   geolocation to link to just-in-time services; and using telemedicine to
   increase access to health service providers and community services. The
   5 retention subthemes included keeping it fun, using gaming mechanics,
   developing content in regional languages, protecting confidentiality,
   and linking to social networking apps.
   Conclusions: These findings may help inform mHealth development in
   India.},

Abstract = {Young people living with HIV (YPLH) are at risk for poor treatment
   adherence. Short message service (SMS) interventions can improve
   adherence, yet few exist for YPLH. Our study investigated preferences
   for a game-based SMS intervention among YPLH in Ghana. Thirty-two YPLH,
   ages 18 to 24, were recruited from an HIV clinic to complete in-depth
   interviews. Content analysis of interview data revealed areas of
   technology use relevant to intervention implementation, including mobile
   communication preferences, internet access, and mobile game use.
   Participants reported high perceived utility towards intervention
   features: treatment reminders, gamification components, and involvement
   of supportive individuals (e.g., providers). Issues with privacy,
   literacy, and cultural/developmental appropriateness were among concerns
   raised. Suggestions were made for strengthening basic SMS features
   (e.g., using code words to protect privacy) and incorporating advanced
   features (e.g., simplifying game interactions). This novel approach may
   help engage YPLH in HIV care if carefully developed with attention
   towards its mechanisms and user preferences.},

Journal = {SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {97},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141-146},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {An estimated 350 million cases of STIs occur globally each year. In
   Sweden, Chlamydia is the most common STI with approximately 30 000 cases
   annually, disproportionally affecting youth. National surveys report low
   condom use among youth. Smartphone coverage is high among this
   tech-savvy group. In collaboration with youth, we developed an
   interactive smartphone application comprising games, peer experiences
   and information snippets to promote condom use.
   Objectives To evaluate in a randomised controlled trial, the
   effectiveness of this smartphone application to improve condom use among
   youth in Stockholm, Sweden.
   Methods This two-arm, individually randomised controlled trial was
   implemented through the Youth Health Clinics (YHC) in Stockholm, Sweden.
   Youth aged 18-23 years, who owned a smartphone and had >= 2 sexual
   partners during the past 6 months were eligible. The intervention
   delivered the interactive elements described above over 180 days. The
   control group received a `dummy' application. Both groups received
   standard of care at the YHC. The primary outcome was proportion of
   consistent (100\%) self-reported condom use at 6 months. Secondary
   outcomes included self-reported number of partners, occurrence of
   STIs/pregnancy and STI tests during the study period. An
   intention-to-treat approach was used.
   Results 214 and 219 youth were randomised to the intervention and
   control groups, respectively. Consistent condom use was reported for
   32/214 (15.0\%) in the intervention group and for 35/219 (16.0\%) in the
   control group (OR 0.9, 95\% CI 0.5 to 1.6). No significant differences
   in secondary outcomes were seen.
   Conclusion We were unable to detect an effect of the intervention.
   Future research should focus on targeting different subgroups within the
   overall risk group, with tailored mHealth interventions. The potential
   for such interventions in settings where sexual health services are
   unavailable should be evaluated.},

Abstract = {Background: Mobile health (mHealth) has been shown to be effective in
   increasing knowledge of sexual health among youth. To date, evaluations
   mostly refer to interventions delivered via computer, email, and text
   messages. The possibility of downloading apps on mobile devices has
   opened up opportunities to develop engaging interventions on safe sexual
   health promotion. To attract young users and have them engage with a
   sexual health app, it is important to involve youth in intervention
   development.
   Objective: This study aimed to obtain input from youth on the content of
   a mobile phone app intended to promote safe sex and increase condom use
   among youth in Stockholm.
   Methods: This study was conducted at the Youth Health Clinics (YHC) in
   Stockholm County, Sweden. A total of 15 individual in-depth interviews
   and 2 focus group discussions (with youth aged 18-23 years) were
   conducted at the YHC in Stockholm. Areas explored were: (1) youth
   perceptions of condom use (advantages and obstacles), (2) perceptions of
   mHealth to promote safe sexual practices, and (3) content development
   for a mobile phone app to promote safe sex.
   Results: The smartphone app was developed based on the categories that
   emerged from the data. With regard to content, youth requested sex
   education, including information on sexually transmitted infections. In
   addition, condom-specific information, including practical usage
   technique, advice on how to have the condom talk, and how to decrease
   shame related to condom use, was requested. Youth suggested different
   modes to deliver the content, including text messages, movie clips, and
   push notifications. It was suggested that the tone of the messages
   delivered should be fun, entertaining, and supportive. The inputs from
   youth influenced the development of the following sections of the app:
   Condom Obstacles and Solutions; Quiz; Games; Self-Refection; Challenges;
   Stories by Peers (stories from peers and information from a doctor);
   Condom Tips, Pep Talk, and Boosting; and Random Facts.
   Conclusions: It is important to use input from youth when developing a
   smartphone intervention since the success of the intervention largely
   depends on the level of engagement and usage by youth. Furthermore, if
   proven efficient in increasing condom use, it is important that the
   development, including content and mode, is thoroughly described so that
   the intervention can be replicated. Likewise, if proven inefficient, it
   is important to learn from mistakes to improve and adjust the
   intervention. The effect of this smartphone app on safe sexual practices
   among youth is being evaluated in a pragmatic randomized controlled
   trial in Stockholm (ISRCTN13212899) and will be reported separately.},

Title = {Enhancing instructional outcomes with a serious gamified system: a
   qualitative investigation of student perceptions},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND LEARNING SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {122},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {383-408},
Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to evaluate the students' perception of their
   learning experiences concerning serious gaming and gamification
   instructions and determines whether they were motivated enough and
   engaged during the educative process in a resource-poor context.
   Moreover, the study evaluated the impact of interactive instructional
   environment outcomes in terms of students' perceptions of the learning
   catalysed by gamified systems, particularly in enhancing attitude change
   coupled with knowledge acquisition.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used a qualitative research
   design technique to collect the data. A total of 108 first year
   secondary school students participated in a sexual health literacy
   course that lasted for a five-week learning period. Using a
   Cluster-sampling technique, three classes were randomly ` assigned to
   serious gaming, gamification and teacher-centred instructions.
   Individual face-to-face interviews were used to assess students'
   perceives required satisfaction with three instructions. Data were
   audio-recorded, and coding analysis was used using NVivo software
   facilitated qualitative data analysis.
   Findings - The results show that serious gaming and gamification
   instructions trumped the traditional teacher-centred instruction method.
   While intervention students were all positive about the serious gaming
   and gamification instructions, non-intervention students were negative
   about conservative teacher-centered learning whose limited interactivity
   also undermined learning relative to the two innovative interventions.
   Research limitations/implications - As a justification to limit
   face-to-face classes. this study may be useful during an emergency
   phenomenon, including the current situation of amid COVID-19. The
   implementation of serious gaming and gamilication as remotely
   instructional options could be among the measures to protect educational
   communities through reducing close-proximity, and eventually, control
   contamination and the spread of viruses.
   Originality/value - The application of serious gaming and game elements
   should not be conceptualised as universal but context-specific. This
   study shows that particularism is essential to optimise the results in
   terms of coming up with a specific design based on the scope of
   evaluation for positive results and develop an intervention that will
   work, especially in the resource-poor context of the developing world.},

Title = {Using Crowdsourcing to Develop a Peer-Led Intervention for Safer Dating
   App Use: Pilot Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Smartphone-based dating apps are rapidly transforming how
   people seek potential sexual and romantic partners. However, they can
   also increase the risk of unsafe sexual behaviors, harassment, and
   infringement of personal privacy. Current research on interventions for
   safer dating app use remains insufficient.
   Objective: The goal of this study was to describe the development of an
   intervention for safer dating app usage using crowdsourcing and peer-led
   approaches.
   Methods: This paper describes the development of an intervention program
   designed to promote safer dating app use among college students.
   Crowdsourcing and peer-led approaches were adopted during key stages of
   the development process. Focus group discussions were held to assess the
   experience and needs of dating app users. A crowdsourcing contest then
   solicited ideas for performance objectives for the intervention. These
   objectives were grouped to further identify practical strategies. A
   one-day intensive workshop was subsequently held with peer mentors to
   brainstorm ideas for the production of creative interventional
   materials. The intervention programs were produced and tested in a pilot
   study. The app's effectiveness will be evaluated in a cluster randomized
   controlled trial.
   Results: The intervention program consists of a risk assessment tool, a
   first-person scenario game, and four short videos. The risk assessment
   tool, comprised of 14 questions, will give the participant a score to
   determine their level of risk of adverse events when using dating apps.
   The scenario game is a first-person simulation game where the players
   are presented with choices when faced with different scenarios. The
   short videos each last 2-4 minutes, with points of discussion aimed at
   addressing the risks of using dating apps. The programs were piloted and
   were found to be relatable and helpful when further modifications were
   made.
   Conclusions: Potential challenges identified during the development
   process included data management and analysis, sustaining peer mentors'
   interests and participation, and balancing between providing more
   information and perpetuating social stigma around dating app use. By
   integrating new approaches, such as crowdsourcing and the peer-led
   approach, in developing an intervention for safer dating app use, our
   development process provides a viable model for developing future
   interventions to address the risks associated with dating app use.},

Title = {Developing a theory-based multimedia intervention for schools to improve
   young people's asthma: my asthma in school (MAIS)},
Journal = {PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {BackgroundAsthma control in adolescents is low with half of the young
   people in a London study identified as having suboptimal control when
   measured using the Asthma Control Test. Control of asthma symptoms can
   be improved by addressing barriers to good self-management, such as poor
   understanding of asthma and adherence to medication. The aim of this
   study was therefore to develop the My Asthma in School (MAIS)
   intervention for the improvement of asthma control and self-management
   in adolescents and to test its initial feasibility. The intervention
   intended to combine a strong focus on theory with a design specifically
   aimed to engage adolescents.MethodsThe intervention development was
   based on previous qualitative and quantitative findings, and on
   guidelines from the Medical Research Council for the development of
   complex interventions. The COM-B (Capability, Opportunity,
   Motivation-Behaviour) model was applied to inform the design of
   intervention elements. Behavioural targets were identified from existing
   barriers to good asthma self-management and were then used to guide the
   development of engaging intervention elements, which were described
   using the Behavioural Change Technique (BCT) Taxonomy version 1.
   Adolescents were involved throughout this process. The MAIS intervention
   was tested in a feasibility phase in London secondary schools with
   adolescents aged between 11 and 13.ResultsThe complex school-based MAIS
   intervention comprised a first school visit from a theatre group, who
   conducted a workshop with all year 7-8 students and addressed peer
   understanding and attitudes to asthma. The second visit included four
   self-management workshops for adolescents with asthma, including games,
   short-films and role play activities. Forty different types of
   techniques to change behaviour were applied, totalling 163 instances of
   BCT use across intervention elements, addressing all areas of
   capability, opportunity and motivation. In this initial feasibility
   study, 1814 adolescents with and without asthma from nine schools
   received the theatre intervention visit; 23 adolescents with asthma from
   one of the schools attended the workshop visit. The intervention was
   found acceptable and engaging, and 91.4\% of participants agreed that
   the workshops changed how they think or feel about asthma.ConclusionThis
   study demonstrates development and initial feasibility of a complex
   theory-based intervention, and how it can combine engaging media and
   interactive elements, to achieve a multi-directional approach to
   behavioural change. However more work is needed to assess the
   feasibility of trial processes, including recruitment and delivery
   format of the workshops.},

Title = {Interactive Narrative in a Mobile Health Behavioral Intervention
   (Tumaini): Theoretical Grounding and Structure of a Smartphone Game to
   Prevent HIV Among Young Africans},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {The increasing availability of smartphones, including in low-income
   countries, offers an unprecedented opportunity to reach individuals with
   innovative health promotion interventions. Electronic games delivered
   via smartphone offer promising avenues for sexual health promotion and
   HIV prevention, especially for young people. By giving players real
   agency in a virtual and safe environment, well-designed games can
   provide a level of experiential learning unparalleled by many other
   behavioral interventions. The design of effective games for health
   relies on multidisciplinary insight and expertise. However, relatively
   few studies discuss the theoretical understanding underlying their
   intervention. Making explicit the theoretical grounding of a game-based
   intervention allows articulation of assumptions and strategies,
   anticipation of outcomes, and evaluation of impacts (including
   intermediate effects), thereby increasing understanding of pathways to
   change, with a view to contributing to the development of more effective
   games. It also helps strengthen the credibility and improve the
   accountability of games for health. We present the multidisciplinary
   theoretical framework-integrating intervention design, mediators, and
   behavioral outcomes-and the structure of an HIV prevention game for
   young African adolescents that has shown promise in a randomized pilot
   study in Western Kenya. The central component of Tumaini (hope for the
   future in Kiswahili) is an interactive role-playing narrative in which
   the player makes choices for characters that determine how their paths
   unfold. In addition, a series of mini-games reinforce skills, and the
   ``My Story{''} component links the game world to the player's own life
   and goals, and a reward system motivates continued play. With its
   ``choose-your-own-adventure{''} format, Tumaini is intended to be
   replayed so that players can experience the consequences resulting from
   different choices made in the role-playing narrative. Grounded in
   theories of narrative and applied communication and in social behavioral
   theories, especially Social Cognitive Theory, Tumaini is designed to
   help young adolescents acquire the information, skills, and motivation
   they need to avoid and reduce sexual risks. We close by situating
   Tumaini within discussion of the theory and practice of using
   interactive narrative in health promotion, with a view to furthering
   theoretical elaboration.},

   Reduction in Adolescents},
Journal = {GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objective: Serious games are emerging as important tools that offer an
   innovative approach to teach adolescents behavioral skills to avoid
   risky situations. PlayForward: Elm City Stories, an interactive
   videogame targeting risk reduction, is currently undergoing evaluation.
   Collecting stakeholder data on its acceptability and real-life
   implementation strategies is critical for successful dissemination.
   Materials and Methods: We collected interview data from four stakeholder
   groups regarding incorporating PlayForward into settings with
   adolescents. Transcripts were coded, creating a comprehensive code
   structure for each stakeholder group. Results: We conducted 40
   semi-structured interviews that included 14 adolescents (aged 12-15
   years; 10 boys), eight parents/guardians (all women), 12
   after-school/school coordinators (nine women), and 14 community partners
   (13 women). We identified four themes that reflected stakeholders'
   perceptions about how the videogame might be implemented in real-world
   settings. (1) Stakeholder groups expressed that the topics of sex,
   alcohol, and drugs were not being taught in an educational setting. (2)
   Stakeholder groups saw a videogame as a viable option to teach about
   sex, alcohol, and drugs. (3) Stakeholder groups thought that the
   videogame would fit well into other settings, such as after-school
   programs or community organizations. (4) Some stakeholder groups
   highlighted additional tools that could help with implementation, such
   as manuals, homework assignments, and group discussion questions.
   Conclusion: Stakeholder groups supported the game as a delivery vehicle
   for targeted content, indicating high acceptability but highlighting
   additional tools that would aid in implementation.},

   Survivors of Childhood Cancer},
Journal = {GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {279-289},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Objectives: Smartphone applications ({''}apps{''}) can be used to
   promote health behavior change and expand the reach of behavioral
   interventions. To date, only a few existing apps have been developed for
   health promotion among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer. To
   address this gap, we developed an app-based intervention, using game
   design characteristics, theory-based behavioral strategies, and
   assistance from a health coach to motivate health behavior change for
   adolescent survivors of childhood cancer. This article describes the
   development and initial feasibility evaluation of the intervention.
   Methods: Using a theoretical framework and an extensive formative
   process, we developed an app-based game ({''}Mila Blooms{''}) that
   promotes healthy eating and physical activity among adolescent survivors
   of childhood cancer. A single-arm 8-week intervention, using this
   app-based game, with assistance from a health coach, was conducted among
   a sample of pediatric cancer survivors (n = 15) to evaluate its initial
   feasibility for promoting health behavior change.
   Results: Results from the feasibility evaluation were encouraging. The
   majority of enrolled participants were retained throughout the 8-week
   intervention (93.8\%). Participant satisfaction feedback indicated
   positive experiences, related to ease of use and enjoyment of the app.
   Although there was little evidence for behavior change attributable to
   the app in this first stage of development, there was a solid
   demonstration of the viability and appeal of the game features, and
   there were no adverse side effects.
   Conclusions: Results provide insights into how gamification can be used
   to promote health behaviors through an app-based intervention. Mila
   Blooms holds promise for promoting health behavior change. Lessons
   learned from our experiences could be useful for the future development
   and implementation of app-based adolescent health interventions.},

Title = {Tobacco prevention interventions- developing life skills through playful
   activities among children and preteens: A systematic review},
Journal = {CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {151},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In children and adolescents, risky behaviours such as tobacco use may be
   addressed by developing life skills. In the field of tobacco prevention,
   the deployment of playful activities for the development of life skills
   has received little attention. This review describes the methods and
   results of tobacco prevention interventions using playful activities to
   develop life skills in children and preteens. A literature search was
   conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science and PsycInfo databases. Articles
   were included in the review based on the following five criteria: (1)
   the article totally or partially concerns a study of a tobacco
   prevention intervention; (2) the subjects were children and preteens
   aged between 6 and 12 years (with an average age within this age range
   or with an interval including all or part of this age range), from a
   general or specific population; (3) the intervention was a life skills
   development action or program; (4) playful activities were employed; (5)
   design, implementation, evaluation methods and/or results are available
   in the article. A total of 11 studies, composed of 9 interventions, were
   included in this systematic review. Most were carried out in school
   settings (n = 8/11) and involved teachers (n = 7/11). Web-based
   interventions (video games, mobile health games/websites and e-learning
   programs) were the playful activities most often used (n = 4/11). The
   majority of the interventions aimed to develop social skills such as the
   ability to resist pressure (n = 9/11). In this review, there were only
   four randomized controlled trial (n = 4/11). The evaluation was
   immediately after the RCTs. Among the measured outcome variables,
   knowledge (n = 8/11), attitudes (n = 5/11), intentions (n = 5/11),
   self-efficacy (n = 4/11) and skills (n = 3/11) were the most assessed.
   Only two of the studies reviewed here conducted a process evaluation (n
   = 2/11). This systematic review provides guidance for future youth
   smoking prevention interventions. Among these, a process evaluation is
   strongly suggested, as well as the use of appropriate variables and
   validated scales to assess the effectiveness of prevention programs. In
   addition, participatory research must allow for the design of adapted
   and relevant in-terventions, but also for the proper development of
   intervention research methodologies in health promotion.},

Title = {An Interactive Mobile App Game to Address Aggression (RegnaTales): Pilot
   Quantitative Study},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: The rapid advancement in media technology has radically
   changed the way we learn and interact with one another. Games, with
   their engaging and interactive approach, hold promise in the delivery of
   knowledge and building of skills. This has potential in child and
   adolescent mental health work, where the lack of insight and motivation
   for therapy are major barriers to treatment. However, research on the
   use of serious games in mental health interventions for children and
   adolescents is still in its infancy.
   Objective: This study adds to the research on serious games in mental
   health interventions through the development and evaluation of
   RegnaTales, a series of 6 mobile apps designed to help children and
   adolescents manage anger. We examined the usability and playability of
   RegnaTales, as well as children's aggression levels before and after the
   game play.
   Methods: A total of 72 children aged between 6 and 12 years were
   recruited for the study. Thirty-five participants had a clinical
   diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorders (DBD), whereas 37 were
   typically developing (TD) children. Each child played 1 of the 6
   RegnaTales apps for approximately 50 min before completing the
   Playability and Usability Questionnaire The Reactive-Proactive
   Aggression Questionnaire was completed before and after the game play.
   Results: The overall results showed high levels of enjoyment and
   playability. TD children and children with DBD had similar experienced
   fun and perceived playability scores on all 6 mobile apps. All 6 mobile
   apps garnered comparable experienced fun and perceived playability
   scores. Furthermore, 42\% (5/12) to 67\% (8/12) of the children
   indicated that they would like to play the games again. Importantly,
   children felt that they acquired skills in anger management, were
   motivated to use them in their daily lives, and felt confident that the
   skills would help them better manage their anger. Children reported
   significantly lower reactive aggression after playing the mobile apps
   Rage Raver (P=.001), Abaddon (P=.008), and RegnaTools (P=.03). These
   apps focused on the psychoeducation of the link between thoughts and
   emotions, as well as equipping the participants with various emotion
   regulation strategies such as relaxation and cognitive restructuring.
   Conclusions: This study presents evidence to support RegnaTales as a
   feasible serious game. The preliminary findings associated with
   reduction in reactive aggression, coupled with future research to
   further establish its efficacy, could warrant RegnaTales as a potential
   intervention for anger issues among clinical and community populations.},

Abstract = {Background: Young people aged under 25 years make up an increasing
   proportion of the population in emerging economies such as Kenya, where
   half of new adult HIV infections are among 15- to 24-year olds.
   Interventions targeting this age group have the potential to avert HIV
   infections among an increasingly large at-risk population. Interactive
   communication technologies offer a promising platform for reaching young
   people in engaging ways.
   Objective: Tumaini is a narrative-based smartphone game designed to help
   young Africans protect themselves from HIV. The objective of this study
   was to pilot test the game, focusing on the data needed to inform a
   future randomized controlled efficacy trial, including assessments of
   study feasibility and safety.
   Methods: The study took place in Kisumu Town, western Kenya, in spring
   2017. The game-based intervention was pilot tested for 16 days with a
   sample of 60 preadolescents aged 11 to 14 years. Participant recruitment
   was initiated through schools. Participants were randomly assigned to
   the control or intervention arms of the study. One parent for each of
   the intervention arm participants was also recruited (n=30). The
   intervention arm participants were provided with smartphones on which
   Tumaini was loaded so that they could play the game at home. Youth
   completed behavioral surveys at baseline, posttest, and 6-week
   follow-up. The intervention arm participants provided quantitative
   feedback on their experience of the game-based intervention at posttest.
   They and their parents further participated in postintervention focus
   group discussions. Feasibility-related study metrics were collected on
   recruitment, enrollment, attrition, safety of participants, and return
   of phones.
   Results: Recruitment and enrollment of the 60 preadolescents and parents
   were successfully completed within 18 days. No participants were lost to
   follow-up: all youth completed all 3 waves of the survey and 27
   intervention arm youth and 22 parents and caregivers participated in the
   focus groups. No safety concerns were reported. All phones were returned
   after the intervention period; none were damaged or lost. All
   intervention arm participants initiated gameplay, recording a mean
   exposure time just under 27 hours.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that it is feasible and safe to test a
   smartphone-based HIV prevention intervention for very young adolescents
   in urban and peri-urban sub-Saharan Africa by initiating recruitment in
   schools and temporarily providing youth participants with smartphones on
   which the game is loaded. A randomized controlled trial powered to
   assess the efficacy of the game-based intervention is being designed to
   be carried out in the same geographic area as the pilot, using similar
   methods.},

Title = {GoLIAh: A Gaming Platform for home-Based Intervention in Autism -
   Principles and design},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Children with Autism need intensive intervention and this is challenging
   in terms of manpower, costs, and time. Advances in Information
   Communication Technology and computer gaming may help in this respect by
   creating a nomadically deployable closed-loop intervention system
   involving the child and active participation of parents and therapists.
   An automated serious gaming platform enabling intensive intervention in
   nomadic settings has been developed by mapping two pivotal skills in
   autism spectrum disorder: Imitation and Joint Attention (JA). Eleven
   games - seven Imitations and four JA - were derived from the Early Start
   Denver Model. The games involved application of visual and audio stimuli
   with multiple difficulty levels and a wide variety of tasks and actions
   pertaining to the Imitation and JA. The platform runs on mobile devices
   and allows the therapist to (1) characterize the child's initial
   difficulties/strengths, ensuring tailored and adapted intervention by
   choosing appropriate games and (2) investigate and track the temporal
   evolution of the child's progress through a set of automatically
   extracted quantitative performance metrics. The platform allows the
   therapist to change the game or its difficulty levels during the
   intervention depending on the child's progress. Performance of the
   platform was assessed in a 3-month open trial with 10 children with
   autism (Trial ID: NCT02560415, Clinicaltrials.gov). The children and the
   parents participated in 80\% of the sessions both at home (77.5\%) and
   at the hospital (90\%). All children went through all the games but,
   given the diversity of the games and the heterogeneity of children
   profiles and abilities, for a given game the number of sessions
   dedicated to the game varied and could be tailored through automatic
   scoring. Parents (N = 10) highlighted enhancement in the child's
   concentration, flexibility, and self-esteem in 78, 89, and 44\% of the
   cases, respectively, and 56\% observed an enhanced parents-child
   relationship. This pilot study shows the feasibility of using the
   developed gaming platform for home-based intensive intervention.
   However, the overall capability of the platform in delivering
   intervention needs to be assessed in a bigger open trial.},

Title = {Primary Prevention of Intimate Partner Violence Among Recently Married
   Dyads Residing in the Slums of Pune, India: Development and Rationale
   for a Dyadic Intervention},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is frequently experienced by
   women of low socioeconomic status in India. It is a human rights
   violation and associated with negative effects on physical and mental
   well-being, underscoring the need for effective prevention strategies.
   Objective: This study aimed to develop a dyadic intervention for the
   primary prevention of IPV among newly married couples residing in slum
   communities in India.
   Methods: The intervention was developed using a community-based,
   mixed-methods design rooted in couple-interdependence theory and guided
   by the intervention mapping (IM) framework. It used the six critical IM
   steps to inform the content and delivery of the intervention: (1) needs
   assessment, (2) preparation of matrices of change objectives, (3)
   selection of theory-based methods and practical applications, (4)
   production of intervention components and materials, (5) intervention
   adoption and implementation, and (6) evaluation planning.
   Results: The resulting Ghya Bharari Ekatra (Take a Flight Together)
   intervention is intended to be delivered in 6 weekly sessions by a
   trained pair of male and female lay community educators to groups of 3
   to 5 newly married couples in the community in which they reside. It
   uses games, discussions, self-reflections, and skill-building exercises
   to cover the following topics: enhancing relationship quality time,
   self-esteem and resilience, communication and conflict management, goal
   setting and implementation, sexual communication and sexual health and
   reproductive health knowledge, and redefining and challenging norms
   surrounding IPV occurrence. The formative work guided the protocol,
   including module duration and timing (2-hour sessions of convenience to
   participants), ordering of modules (based on potential level of interest
   and sensitivity of the topics), content (ie, informed scripts of role
   plays and films), intervention delivery methods (ie, interactive
   activities), and selection of the interventionists (based on capacity to
   connect with participants) and venue (community-based, convenient, and
   safe spaces). Ghya Bharari Ekatra was piloted between January and May
   2018, and evaluation is presently underway.
   Conclusions: Ghya Bharari Ekatra is evidence-based, grounded in
   intervention-mapping, and developed and iteratively refined using a
   community-based participatory research approach, suggesting it has great
   potential to be an acceptable and effective solution to preventing IPV
   among newly married couples.},

   MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Individuals and families increasingly turn to e-mental health apps for
   education, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health disorders and to
   promote mental wellness. These apps provide significant increases in
   convenience from existing services, since they can augment or replace
   services with on-demand access within the home. This raises important
   questions about self-selection of interventions. Who uses these
   applications? How do individuals perceive their own progress within
   applications? This study is a retrospective data analysis-based
   evaluation of a commercially available e-mental health program that
   includes biofeedback video games that help children build emotion
   regulation skills by demonstrating and prompting children to practice
   bodily focused emotion regulation techniques. The e-mental health
   program also provided parent psychoeducation-focused coaching at the
   time of the evaluation. Data collection instruments used to inform the
   retrospective study included parent intake surveys, gameplay engagement
   data, and notes from parent coaching calls. The evaluation revealed
   families presenting for common symptoms associated with emotion
   regulation deficits, as opposed to a wellness cohort looking for
   additional support. Families near-universally activated and engaged with
   the intervention, willing to carry out an extended ``dose{''} of the
   e-mental health program in their home. Parents self-reported their
   perceptions of their children's emotion regulation progress, primarily
   in terms of children's increased use of emotion regulation skills,
   improved emotion awareness and communication, calmer demeanor, greater
   confidence, and improved relationships. More work is needed to
   understand the corresponding clinical progress from this inhome
   training, as well as its implications for how emotion regulation skills
   grow.},

Title = {mHealth video gaming for human papillomavirus vaccination among college
   men-qualitative inquiry for development},
Journal = {MHEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually
   transmitted infection in the United States. Persistent infection with
   HPV can cause various cancers; however, HPV vaccination can prevent
   infections associated with high risk, cancerous strains of the virus. As
   it relates to HPV, college age men have been identified as one of the
   catch-up vaccination groups. Among college age men, gaming is an
   extremely popular extracurricular activity. Further, video games have
   emerged as a popular public health intervention tool. Therefore, this
   study aims to collect qualitative data on how to develop, implement and
   evaluate the effectiveness of a gaming intervention to increase HPV risk
   perceptions, improve self-efficacy and increase intention to receive the
   HPV vaccine among male college students (18-26 years old).
   Methods: Four focus group sessions ranging from eight to ten individuals
   were conducted among male college students from one large
   research-intensive university in the South. Using grounded theory, data
   from focus group interviews were coded using NVivo software to identify
   emergent themes.
   Results: Participants emphasized that although customization was not
   viewed as important by college aged males, the ability to tailor in game
   experiences or experience different things each time they played
   (creative freedom) was more important. They encouraged that the digital
   game be created on a mobile platform, incorporate health messages, and
   be informative to reach their population. Furthermore, they suggested
   innovative way to disseminate the game, which included having health
   department/health care providers prescribe the game to patients as an
   end of clinical interaction strategy.
   Conclusions: College age men, are natural avid gamers, enjoy game play,
   and can engage in learning online or offline. While platform preference
   varies among gamer type, college age men in our study emphasized that
   mobile based gaming is the most advantageous way to increase
   knowledge/awareness and encourage positive in game behavior which can
   impact out of game behaviors such as vaccination. Because of the level
   of access and natural disposition of mHealth technology seen as an
   ``extension of the self{''}, games for health developers should consider
   the mobile platform as the ideal for the target demographic.},

   Adolescents: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Difficulties in emotion regulation are common in adolescence
   and are associated with poor social and mental health outcomes. However,
   psychological therapies that promote adaptive emotion regulation may be
   inaccessible and unattractive to youth. Digital interventions may help
   address this need.
   Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to
   synthesize evidence on the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of
   emotion regulation digital interventions in children and early
   adolescents aged 8 to 14 years.
   Methods: Systematic searches of Web of Science, MEDLINE, PsycINFO,
   EMBASE, Education Resources Information Centre, ACM Digital Library, and
   IEEE Xplore up to July 2020 identified 39 studies, of which 11 (28\%)
   were included in the meta-analyses (n=2476 participants). A bespoke tool
   was used to assess risk of bias.
   Results: The studies evaluated digital games (27/39, 69\%), biofeedback
   (4/39, 10\%), virtual or augmented reality (4/39, 10\%), and program or
   multimedia (4/39, 10\%) digital interventions in samples classified as
   diagnosed, at risk, healthy, and universal. The most consistent evidence
   came from digital games, which reduced negative emotional experience
   with a small significant effect, largely in youth at risk of anxiety
   (Hedges g=-0.19, 95\% CI -0.34 to -0.04). In general, digital
   interventions tended to improve emotion regulation, but this effect was
   not significant (Hedges g=0.19, 95\% CI -0.16 to 0.54).
   Conclusions: Most feasibility issues were identified in diagnosed youth,
   and acceptability was generally high across intervention types and
   samples. Although there is cause to be optimistic about digital
   interventions supporting the difficulties that youth experience in
   emotion regulation, the predominance of early-stage development studies
   highlights the need for more work in this area.},

   (The Secret of Seven Stones): Development and Feasibility Study},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Early adolescent unintended pregnancy and sexually
   transmitted infection prevention are significant public health
   challenges in the United States. Parental influence can help adolescents
   make responsible and informed sexual health decisions toward delayed
   sexual debut; yet parents often feel ill equipped to communicate about
   sex-related topics. Intergenerational games offer a potential strategy
   to provide life skills training to young adolescents (aged 11-14 years)
   while engaging them and their parents in communication about sexual
   health.
   Objective: This study aims to describe the development of a web-based
   online sexual health intergenerational adventure game, the Secret of
   Seven Stones (SSS), using an intervention mapping (IM) approach for
   developing theory- and evidence-based interventions.
   Methods: We followed the IM development steps to describe a theoretical
   and empirical model for young adolescent sexual health behavior, define
   target behaviors and change objectives, identify theory-based methods
   and practical applications to inform design and function, develop and
   test a prototype of 2 game levels to assess feasibility before
   developing the complete 18-level game, draft an implementation plan that
   includes a commercial dissemination strategy, and draft an evaluation
   plan including a study design for a randomized controlled trial efficacy
   trial of SSS.
   Results: SSS comprised an adventure game for young adolescent skills
   training delivered via a desktop computer, a text-based notification
   system to provide progress updates for parents and cues to initiate
   dialogue with their 11- to 14-year-old child, and a website for parent
   skills training and progress monitoring. Formative prototype testing
   demonstrated feasibility for in-home use and positive usability ratings.
   Conclusions: The SSS intergenerational game provides a unique addition
   to the limited cadre of home-based programs that facilitate parent
   involvement in influencing young adolescent behaviors and reducing
   adolescent sexual risk taking. The IM framework provided a logical and
   thorough approach to development and testing, attentive to the need for
   theoretical and empirical foundations in serious games for health.},

Abstract = {With the rise of the mobile Internet, APP treatment models for autism
   have also emerged. In China, there are not many applications of health
   education for children with autism. Its functions are mainly focused on
   prevention and improvement of knowledge. Many behavioral therapies
   include applying pressure to the invisible external pressure of autism
   to achieve appropriate stimulation and correction. This has brought
   great injustice to the wishes of the children. When children with autism
   strongly oppose this unfair behavior, it may lead to other extreme
   behaviors in children with autism. This article adopts the method of
   letting children with autism actually apply this APP for comprehensive
   intervention treatment, and let this APP combine with their daily
   courses: comprehensive sports training, speech training, cognitive
   training, game training, self-care training. For courses such as art
   training and computer games, the children were evaluated for the first
   time before training, and then evaluated every 2 months. Data were
   collected to compare whether the children's background factors had a
   significant impact on the rehabilitation effect of comprehensive
   interventions. The results of the experiment proved that in the five
   assessments of perception, gross motor, fine motor, language and
   communication, cognition, the children had statistically significant
   differences in the three scores (P < 0.05). This also shows from the
   side that our APP has a certain effect on children with autism, and is
   of great strategic significance for adjuvant treatment of autism.},

Abstract = {The increased popularity of social media and mobile gaming among young
   adults provides an opportunity for innovative nutrition programs. This
   review evaluated the efficacy of these strategies in interventions
   targeted at 18- to 35-year-olds. The protocol was guided by the
   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
   (PRISMA). Ten scientific databases, information technology conference
   proceedings, and gray literature were searched. Two reviewers conducted
   screening, data extraction, and quality assessments. Interventions were
   included if they used social media or electronic games. Comparisons were
   made pre- to post-intervention, or between intervention and control
   arms. Outcomes of interest included change in nutrition knowledge,
   attitudes, behavior, or weight and/or body composition. Eleven social
   media based (randomized controlled trials {[}RC] n=7) and six game-based
   {[}RCT n=1]) interventions were included. Overall quality of studies was
   low. Social media based strategies included forum/blogs (n=5), Facebook
   (n=5), Twitter (n=1), YouTube (n=1), and chat rooms (n=1). Eight (RCT
   n=6) of 11 social media based studies demonstrated improvements in
   outcomes. Findings suggested that social media may be more effective
   when combined with other strategies. Virtual reality games (n=3),
   web-based games (n=2), and a mobile application (n=1) were used in the
   gaming interventions. While a significant increase in knowledge was
   reported by three gaming studies (RCT=1), two used non validated tools
   and longer-term measures of weight and behavioral outcomes were limited.
   The use of social media and gaming for nutrition promotion is in its
   infancy. Preliminary evidence suggests that these strategies have some
   utility for intervening with young adults. Further research using
   high-quality study designs is required, with measurement of outcomes
   over longer time periods. The systematic review protocol is registered

Abstract = {Most congestion control schemes are based on user cooperation, i.e.,
   they implicitly assume that users are willing to share their private
   information and to take actions such that the network operates
   efficiently. However, a self-interested and strategic user might exploit
   such schemes to obtain an individual gain at the expenses of the other
   users, misrepresenting its private information and overusing the
   resources. We first quantify the inefficiency of the network in the
   presence of selfish users for two different scenario: in the complete
   information case - in which the users have no private information - and
   in the incomplete information case - in which the users have private
   information. Then, we ask whether the congestion control scheme can be
   designed to be robust to self-interested strategic users. To reach this
   objective, we use an intervention scheme. For the complete information
   scenario we describe a scheme that is able to give the users an
   incentive to optimally use the resources. For the incomplete information
   scenario we describe two schemes that provide the users with an
   incentive to report truthfully and to use the resources efficiently,
   although not always optimally. Illustrative results show that the
   considered schemes can considerably improve the efficiency of the
   network.},

Title = {Development and evaluation of a technology-enhanced, enquiry-based
   learning program on managing neonatal extravasation injury: A
   pre-test/post-test mixed-methods study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {97},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Extravasation injury remains a significant preventable cause
   of morbidity and mortality in neonates. Equipping nursing students with
   the requisite knowledge and skills is essential for appropriate
   prevention, early detection, and management of extravasation injury.
   Objectives: To develop a technology-enhanced, enquiry-based learning
   program for nursing students on the prevention and management of
   neonatal extravasation injury and examine its impact on their knowledge,
   approaches to studying and experience of learning.
   Design: A pre-test/post-test study with qualitative evaluation.
   Settings: Two university pre-registration nursing programs in Hong Kong.
   Participants: A total of 192 senior-year nursing students.
   Methods: A novel learning program was developed comprising 25
   scenario-based video vignettes supplemented with critical-thinking
   exercises, discussion guides, interactive games, reading materials and a
   3-hour in-class interactive workshop. Students received unlimited online
   access to the program. Data were collected at baseline and one-month
   post-workshop. Outcomes were students' level of knowledge of prevention
   and management of extravasation injuries and related care, approaches to
   studying, and experience of learning. Paired t-tests were performed on
   prepost-test outcome data and individual semi-structured interviews were
   conducted at onemonth post-workshop, transcribed verbatim and analyzed
   thematically.
   Results: There were statistically significant improvements in students'
   level of knowledge and use of a deep approach to learning at one month
   compared with baseline. Students were highly satisfied with the program,
   appreciating the video vignettes and interactive small group discussions
   with academics and clinicians. Suggestions for enhancing the program
   included more time for the workshop, interaction with clinicians, and
   details on the administration of neonatal medications and dosages.
   Conclusions: This study showed that a novel technology-enhanced,
   enquiry-based learning program was effective in enhancing nursing
   students' knowledge of the prevention and management of neonatal
   extravasation injury, approaches to studying and experience of learning.},

Abstract = {Digital applications, or ``serious games{''} for health address learning
   goals in a cognitively active, interactive manner, with the potential
   for widespread dissemination. This study used a mixed methods approach
   to develop and conduct a formative evaluation of a digital application
   for sexual assault prevention. Make a change is a digital application
   that uses the principles of games for health to foster learning,
   engagement, and skill-building around risk and protective factors for
   sexual victimization, sexual aggression, and bystander intervention. The
   digital application includes four narrative chapters, six embedded
   activities, as well as a user-derived change plan in which individuals
   establish goals for behavior change following program completion. This
   multisite study at a 2- and a 4-year college utilized student interviews
   (n = 14), stakeholder interviews (n = 10), and focus groups with
   students (n = 40) to inform intervention development. A total of 41
   college students then participated in an open trial and completed
   self-report surveys (pre, post, and 1-month follow-up) to evaluate the
   feasibility, acceptability, utility, and preliminary outcomes. Most of
   the sample reported enjoyment, usefulness, and perceived competence
   after completing the application. Data evidenced a trend to reduce the
   frequency of heavy drinking, and perceptions of social norms evidenced
   change over time. Findings support the feasibility and effectiveness of
   this novel format for the delivery of sexual assault prevention

Abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that using technology and Internet-based
   methods in prevention programming can be an efficacious delivery
   practice. This literature implies that applying digital technologies to
   prevention may provide a unique opportunity to carry out interventions
   with reliability and in a manner that is more appealing and suitable to
   youth. This exploratory study reports on a proof-of-concept evaluation
   of Choices \& Consequences, a substance abuse and relationship violence
   prevention program that integrates digital technologies and devices with
   game-based behavior change techniques. Six focus groups (N = 44) were
   conducted with youth living in a SouthweStem city. Results suggest that
   youth preferred various aspects of this prevention game to traditional
   methods. They especially liked that the game was engaging and that they
   were able to learn in both formal and informal environments, that is
   interacting with each other and a facilitator or playing the game on
   their own, Results also found that youth learned many lessons while
   playing the game and they believe the game may help prevent substance
   abuse and relationship violence among the target population of early
   adolescents. Thus, this research suggests that prevention programs for
   youth that combine interactive methods, mobile technology, social
   networking, and competitive gaming could be a strong alternative to
   traditional delivery methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Creating a Theoretically Grounded Gaming App to Increase Adherence to
   Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis: Lessons From the Development of the Viral

Abstract = {Background: In the United States, young minority men who have sex with
   men (MSM) are most likely to become infected with HIV. The use of
   antiretroviral medications to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection
   (pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP) is an efficacious and promising
   prevention strategy. There have been significant advances regarding
   PrEP, including the definitive demonstration that PrEP reduces HIV
   acquisition and the development of clinical prescribing guidelines.
   Despite these promising events, the practical implementation of PrEP can
   be challenging. Data show that PrEP's safety and effectiveness could be
   greatly compromised by suboptimal adherence to treatment, and there is
   concern about the potential for an increase in HIV risk behavior among
   PrEP users. Due to these challenges, the prescribing of PrEP should be
   accompanied by behavioral interventions to promote adherence.
   Objective: This study aimed to develop an immersive, action-oriented
   iPhone gaming intervention to improve motivation for adherence to PrEP.
   Methods: Game development was guided by social learning theory, taking
   into consideration the perspectives of young adult MSM who are taking
   PrEP. A total of 20 young men who have sex with men (YMSM; aged 18-35
   years) were recruited from a sexually transmitted infection (STI), HIV
   testing, and PrEP care clinic in Jackson, Mississippi, between October
   2016 and June 2017. They participated in qualitative interviews guided
   by the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model of behavior
   change. The mean age of participants was 26 years, and all the
   participants identified as male. Acceptability of the game was assessed
   with the Client Service Questionnaire and session evaluation form.
   Results: A number of themes emerged that informed game development. YMSM
   taking PrEP desired informational game content that included new and
   comprehensive details about the effectiveness of PrEP, details about
   PrEP as it relates to doctors' visits, and general information about
   STIs other than HIV. Motivational themes that emerged were the desire
   for enhancement of future orientation; reinforcement of positive
   influences from partners, parents, and friends; collaboration with
   health care providers; decreasing stigma; and a focus on personal
   relevance of PrEP-related medical care. Behavioral skills themes
   centered around self-efficacy and strategies for adherence to PrEP and
   self-care.
   Conclusions: We utilized youth feedback, IMB, and agile software
   development to create a multilevel, immersive, action-oriented iPhone
   gaming intervention to improve motivation for adherence to PrEP. There
   is a dearth of gaming interventions for persons on PrEP. This study is a
   significant step in working toward the development and testing of an
   iPhone gaming intervention to decrease HIV risk and promote adherence to
   PrEP for YMSM.},

Title = {Health Education, its Methods and Effects on Parents' Knowledge,
   Attitudes, and Behaviours to Prevent Unintentional Child Injuries at
   Home: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {CHILD CARE IN PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 28},
Abstract = {Thousands of young children die or sustain life changing disabilities
   every year because of unintentional child injury (UCI) at home. Many
   injuries could be prevented if parents and caregivers were more aware of
   risks and accident-avoidance strategies. The aim of this review was
   two-fold. First, we explored whether health education modified parent or
   caregiver knowledge, attitudes, or behaviour related to injury awareness
   and prevention. Our secondary aim was to describe strategies used when
   delivering health education. Intervention studies using quantitative
   methods published after 2010 were included. The participants were
   caregivers or parents of children younger than six years of age. A
   systematic search of multiple databases yielded twelve studies. The risk
   of bias (ROB) was assessed using the Cochrane ROBINS-I for
   non-randomised and ROB-2 for randomised studies. Data synthesis was
   performed following the steps described in the SWiM guideline. We
   followed PRISMA guidelines to report the process and results.
   Interventions were usually one-off, multifaceted, and interactive using
   printed materials, discussion, didactic teaching, video, and games.
   Improvement of knowledge ranged from 12.5\% to 85\%. Attitude
   improvement was noted in five studies and ranged from 6.6\% to 28\%.
   Self-reported behavioural change was noted in six studies. Follow up
   duration varied from less than one month to six months. The observed
   changes have not been linked to the numbers or severity of UCI. Health
   education is beneficial, but the true long-term impact has yet to be
   fully explored. Studies that provided the greatest improvements used
   theories of behaviour change and interventions that were designed for
   the specific needs of the target population. Our review provides health
   care professionals with evidence of the potential benefits of health
   education in enhancing parents' awareness regarding preventing UCI and
   information about how to deliver health education, that can guide the
   review of prevention practices of UCI.},

   Adolescents in Medical Settings: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 13},
Abstract = {Adolescents with chronic conditions are highly likely to encounter
   physical, social and psychological difficulties that can threaten their
   overall wellbeing and health. As any other adolescent, they need to be
   helped to tackle the non-medical determinants of their health. This is
   the aim of primary prevention and general health promotion
   interventions. The present paper aims to review any hospital-based
   intervention that strives to promote general health in chronically ill
   teenagers. A systematic process of search and screening revealed four
   articles that presented and evaluated non-disease specific interventions
   that explicitly aimed to promote the overall health of chronically ill
   teenagers in clinical settings. Congruently with health promotion
   principles and values, the interventions described in our selection of
   articles targeted positive health determinants, in terms of personal
   skills and attitudes that contribute to psychosocial resiliency. The
   clinical relevance and feasibility of developing non-disease specific
   health promotion interventions in clinical settings was confirmed.
   However, the lack of relevant reported details did not allow us to
   highlight the key factors and mechanisms associated with successful
   interventions for health promotion targeted at chronically ill
   adolescents attending health care settings. Moreover, the design of the
   included studies varied in quality: number of participants, presence of
   a post-test and a follow-up, use of validated questionnaires, etc.
   Well-conducted non-disease specific clinical health promotion
   interventions still remain an under-investigated area of research, and
   maybe even of practice.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the outcomes of an exploratory study focused on the
   evaluation of an interactive music exergame for People with Dementia
   (PwD) and their caregivers. PwD tend to isolate themselves from the

   provide an effective way to achieve social interaction with PwD. At the
   same time, physical activity plays a major role in dementia-related
   interventions because it can slow down progression and provide
   meaningful stimulation. Our developed interactive music game bounds
   these two concerns together; we evaluated the system afterwards
   regarding its individual and social impact and its integration into the
   daily routines of both PwD and their caregivers, focusing on its
   capacity to provide both enjoyment and relief from some of the effects
   of dementia. Qualitative data collected over 4 months confirmed the
   valuable impact of music-based interventions of PwD. Of particular note
   was how PwD used the game to improve or maintain their physical
   condition while recovering past memories and an interest in social
   interaction.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Background: Online dating apps are popular platforms for seeking romance
   and sexual relationships among young adults. As mobile apps can easily
   gain access to a pool of strangers ({''}new friends{''}) at any time and
   place, it leads to heightened sexual health risks and privacy concerns.
   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-led
   web-based intervention for online dating apps to prepare Chinese college
   students so that they have better self-efficacy when using dating apps.
   Methods: An open clustered randomized controlled trial was conducted
   among students from three colleges (The University of Hong Kong, Hang
   Seng University of Hong Kong, and Yijin Programme of Vocational Training
   College) in Hong Kong. Students aged 17 to 27 years who attended common
   core curriculum or general education were randomized into intervention
   and control groups. The intervention material, developed with high peer
   engagement, included four short videos, an interactive scenario game,
   and a risk assessment tool. An existing website promoting physical
   activities and healthy living was used as a control. Using the
   information, motivation, and behavioral skills (IMB) approach to design
   the evaluation, questionnaires covering participants' sociodemographics
   and dating app characteristics, as well as the general self-efficacy
   scale (GSE) as the primary outcome and the risk propensity scale (RPS)
   as the secondary outcome were administered before, immediately after,
   and at 1 month after the intervention. Intention-to-treat analysis was
   adopted, and between-group differences were assessed using the
   Mann-Whitney U test. A post-hoc multiple linear regression model was
   used to examine the correlates of the GSE and RPS.
   Results: A total of 578 eligible participants (290 in the intervention
   group and 288 in the control group) participated in the study with 36
   lost to follow-up. There were more female participants (318/542, 58.7\%)
   than male participants in the sample, reflecting the distribution of
   college students. Over half of the participants (286/542, 52.8\%)
   reported the following reasons for using dating apps: being curious
   (170/498, 34.1\%), trying to make new friends (158/498, 31.7\%), and
   finding friends with similar interests (121/498, 24.3\%). Overall, the
   participants in the intervention group reported favorable experiences
   when compared with the finding in the control group. There was
   significant improvement in the GSE score and reduction in the RPS score
   (P<.001) in the intervention group. University of Hong Kong students
   were more susceptible to risk reduction after the intervention when
   compared with students from the other two institutions.
   Conclusions: The online intervention was effective in improving general
   self-efficacy and reducing risk tendency among young students. Future
   work is needed to determine if this approach is cost-effective and such
   behavioral change is sustainable.},

Title = {Video Game to Attenuate Pandemic-Related Stress From an Equity Lens:
   Development and Usability Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: The emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has
   introduced additional pressures on an already fragile mental health care
   system due to a significant rise in depression, anxiety, and stress
   among Canadians. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is known to
   be an efficacious treatment to reduce such mental health issues, few
   people have access to CBT in an engaging and sustainable manner. To
   address this gap, a collaboration between the Centre for Addiction and
   Mental Health (CAMH) and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC)
   developed CBT-based self-led, online, clinician-tested modules in the
   form of a video game, named Legend of Evelys, and evaluated its
   usability in the attenuation of a COVID-19-related increase in stress.
   Objective: We here present the conceptualization and design of new
   self-care modules in the form of a video game, its implementation in a
   technological infrastructure, and inclusivity and privacy considerations
   that informed the development. A usability study of the modules was
   performed to assess the video game's usability, user engagement, and
   user perceptions.
   Methods: The development of the video game involved establishment of a
   technology infrastructure for secure implementation of the software for
   the modules and a clinician-led assessment of the clinical utility of
   these modules through two ``whiteboard{''} sessions. The usability study
   was informed by a mixed methods sequential explanatory design to
   evaluate the intervention of the mobile app through two distinct phases:
   quantitative data collection using in-app analytics data and two
   surveys, followed by qualitative data collection by semistructured
   interviews.
   Results: A total of 32 participants trialed the app for 2 weeks. They
   used the video game an average of six times and rated the game as
   ``good{''} based on the Systems Usability Scale score. In terms of
   stress reduction, the study demonstrated a significant difference in the
   participants' Perceived Stress Scale score at baseline (mean 22.14, SD
   6.187) compared with that at the 2-week follow-up (mean 18.04, SD 6.083;
   t(27)=3.628, P=.001). Qualitative interviews helped participants
   identify numerous functionality issues and provided specific
   recommendations, most of which were successfully integrated into the
   video game for future release.
   Conclusions: Through this collaboration, we have established that it is
   possible to incorporate CBT exercises into a video game and have these
   exercises adopted to address stress. While video games are a promising
   strategy to help people with their stress and anxiety, there is a
   further need to examine the real-world effectiveness of the Legend of
   Evelys in reducing anxiety.},

Title = {Conducting individualised hand therapy evaluation with around-device
   hand movements},
Journal = {MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 30},
Abstract = {Office workers often resort to therapeutic systems to address muscular
   and nerve disorders caused by poor gestures and extraordinary workloads.
   These systems deliver effective treatment with a playable experience.
   However, the therapeutic evaluation still heavily relies on occupational
   therapists' diagnose, which is time-consuming and subjective. This
   highlights the necessity for a system that adheres to standard treatment
   protocols and enables individualised therapeutic evaluations. In this
   study, we proposed a hand therapy system based on around-device hand
   movements with a capacitive-sensing mobile phone case to realise instant
   yet approximate hand therapy evaluation. Moreover, we conducted
   empirical studies to investigate the usability and acceptability of this
   system and its potential influence on office workers' willingness to
   take hand therapy exercises during working hours. The results showed
   that this instant yet approximate evaluation system can significantly
   improve the workers' hand therapy frequencies during working intervals.
   Furthermore, it can quantitatively measure and report on individual
   therapy performances, helping office workers understand their therapy
   outcomes and promoting their willingness to take therapeutic hand
   exercises. Our results introduce a new perspective for designing mobile
   systems for well-being.},

Abstract = {Research on gamified language learning often involves the use of digital
   games. Little is known about the use of non-technology games in
   promoting language learning despite their accessibility. This paper aims
   to fill in this lacuna by providing insights into international
   students' engagement in non-technology gamified English language
   learning in the context of a Lithuanian university. The research, which
   used a case study approach as its methodology, involved a total of 30
   international students at a Lithuanian university together with their
   two instructors. They were observed for two weeks, and then interviewed
   by the researchers. An inductive thematic analysis approach proposed by
   Braun and Clark was used to analyse the data. The findings revealed that
   the students' engagement with the non-technology gamified lessons have
   impacted them positively as they believe that they have improved English
   language proficiency and better mastery of the 21-st century learning
   skills. However, the participants raised several issues related to
   cultural sensitivity and blurred learning outcomes. This study concluded
   that non- technology games serve as a useful tool in promoting language
   learning in the 21st century if it is carefully designed to attract
   learners' interests and at the same to time meet the learning outcomes.
   This study is hoped to encourage practitioners to experiment with
   non-technology gamified lessons and provide guidelines for them in
   conducting effective non-technology gamified lessons.},

Title = {Information and communication technologies-based interventions for

   randomized control trials from a positive technology perspective},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have become more
   widely used in the past years to help people with autism spectrum
   conditions (ASC). Serious games embedded into computers or tablets, as
   well as social robots, are the most employed ICT-related tools that are
   appealing to and appropriate for autistic children. The goal of ICT
   applications is to enhance behavioral abnormalities associated with ASC
   while also creating an interactive link between one person and one
   computer. Comparatively, to human-based therapy, ICT tools aid to
   inspire autistic children by providing predictability and regularity of
   tasks. Regaining social skills is the primary behavioral goal for which
   ICT tools have been designed and implemented. In the past several years,
   many studies have been created to show how effective it is at improving
   targeted behaviors. However, only a small number of researchers have
   used an RCT approach to evaluate its effectiveness. In this systematic
   review, we only included RCT studies where ICT technologies were used to
   help children with ASC in improving their social skills. Only 14 RCT
   studies satisfied the criteria and 12 described significant
   improvements, showing how the use of technology in educational contexts
   produced better improvement in developing several social skill facets
   with respect to the traditional face-to-face approach. Some studies used
   interventions and outcome measures focused on the core ASC symptoms, but
   many others addressed neurocognitive functions directly, like social
   cognition or emotional regulation, while other more general functions
   such as language or adaptive behaviors. We propose a classification
   based on processes and outcome measures to foster future research in
   this specific area of research. The behavioral intervention mediated by
   technological tools such as computer-based, tablet, and social robotics,
   undoubtedly provides a comfortable environment that promotes constant
   learning for people with ASC. Evidence provided in this review
   highlights the translational potential of this field of study in primary
   care practice and educational settings.},

Title = {Game Plan, a Web-Based Intervention to Improve Adherence and Persistence
   to HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis and Reduce Heavy Drinking in Gay,
   Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men: Usability and User
   Experience Testing},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Encouraging consistent use of pre-exposure prophylaxis
   (PrEP) is essential for reducing HIV incidence, particularly among gay,
   bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), and especially
   those who engage in heavy drinking. Although practice guidelines
   recommend providing adherence counseling to PrEP patients, clinics and
   providers may not have the resources or expertise to provide it.
   Internet-facilitated interventions have been shown to improve HIV
   prevention outcomes, including medication and care adherence. Game Plan
   is a website we created to help users make a tangible plan for reducing
   their HIV risk. We designed additional components of Game Plan to
   address key individual level barriers to PrEP use.
   Objective: The aim of this mixed methods research is to test the
   usability and user experience of these components with intended users:
   GBM who drink heavily and are on PrEP.
   Methods: In study 1 (usability), we completed a detailed individual
   interview in which participants (n=10) walked through a prototype of the
   website, thinking aloud as they did, and completed a follow-up interview
   and web-based survey afterward. Study 2 (user experience) involved
   providing participants (n=40) with a link to the prototype website to
   explore on their own and asking them to complete the same follow-up
   survey afterward. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic
   analysis, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze quantitative
   data.
   Results: Users in both studies gave the website excellent ratings for
   usability, overall satisfaction, and quality, and most often described
   the site as informative, helpful, and supportive. Users also rated the
   site's content and feel as respectful of them and their autonomy,
   empathetic, and they stated that it conveyed confidence in their ability
   to change. The study 1 interviews highlighted the importance of the
   website's esthetics to the participants' engagement with it and its
   credibility in prompting genuine reflection.
   Conclusions: GBM who reported heavy drinking and used PrEP generally
   found a website focused on helping them to create a plan to use PrEP
   consistently to be helpful. Adopting user-centered design methods and
   attending to the esthetics of mobile health interventions are important
   steps toward encouraging engagement and reducing at-risk behaviors.},

Title = {Integrating a Location-Based Mobile Game in the Museum Visit: Evaluating
   Visitors' Behaviour and Learning},
Journal = {ACM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING AND CULTURAL HERITAGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Location-based systems currently represent a suitable solution to
   enhance cultural experiences inside museums, as they can satisfy
   visitors' needs through the provision of contextualized contents and
   services. In this framework, a promising approach to captivate the
   attention of teenagers-a hard to please target audience-is represented
   by mobile serious games, such as playful activities aiming to primarily
   fulfil educational purposes. The use of a mobile digital tool during the
   visit definitely discloses new opportunities for contextual learning
   scenarios; however, so far, only a few studies have analysed the impact
   of different communication approaches on visitors' degree of exploration
   and acquisition of knowledge. This work aims to enrich this field of
   research, presenting the conceptual framework; the design principles;
   and the evaluation results of ``Gossip at palace,{''} a location-based
   mobile game integrating a storytelling approach. The game was developed
   for an Italian historical residence to communicate its 18th-century
   history to teenagers, capitalizing on narrative and game mechanics to
   foster young visitors' motivations to explore the museum and facilitate
   their meaning-making process. Following a mixed-methods perspective, the
   article firstly describes to what extent the components of the
   application were appreciated by teenagers as well as by other visitor
   segments. Secondly, it provides an insight on the effectiveness of the
   game in facilitating the acquisition of historical knowledge by
   participants, enriched by considerations on the methods to be adopted
   when evaluating mobile learning in informal educational settings.
   Thirdly, players' degree of use of the digital game throughout the visit
   is compared to analogous patterns registered for people using a
   multimedia mobile guide in the same venue. On the one hand, the study
   pointed out that the game facilitated a wider exploration of the museum;
   on the other, it highlighted that players mainly gained a superficial
   knowledge of the proposed contents.},

   Adherence for HIV-Positive Young Men Who Have Sex With Men (AllyQuest):
   Development and Pilot Study},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: HIV disproportionately impacts young men who have sex with
   men (YMSM) who experience disparities across the HIV care continuum.
   Addressing antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among YMSM is an
   urgent public health priority. Technology-based
   interventions-particularly mobile health platforms-can provide tailored
   adherence interventions and allow YMSM to engage and connect with
   others.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to describe the development
   of AllyQuest, a novel, theoretically-based, smartphone app designed to
   improve engagement in care and ART adherence and social support among
   HIV-positive YMSM.
   Methods: AllyQuest was built on an established platform for patient
   engagement that embeds social networking and fundamental game mechanics,
   such as challenges, points, and rewards. A medication tracker provides
   reminders to promote ART adherence via personalized adherence strategies
   that are user and context specific; a calendar allows for reflection on
   adherence over time. After iterative development with input from two
   youth advisory boards, usability testing was conducted to assess app
   functionality, comprehension of the educational content, use of
   intervention features, and overall impressions of app relevance and
   appeal. A 28-day pilot trial was conducted with 20 HIV+ YMSM to evaluate
   intervention feasibility and acceptability.
   Results: Mean age of participants was 21.8 years (range 19-24), and 95\%
   (19/20) of the participants were nonwhite. The mean time of app use was
   158.4 min (SD 114.1), with a range of 13 to 441 min. There was a mean of
   21.2 days of use (out of a total possible 28 days). There were 222 posts
   to the daily discussion social wall. Feasibility and acceptability
   ratings were high. Overall, participants found the app easy to use and
   navigate, not intrusive, and had few reported technical issues. Higher
   levels of app usage were positively correlated with HIV self-management
   outcomes, and there was a statistically significant (P<.05) positive
   association between the number of days logged into the app and knowledge
   and confidence in ability to reliably take HIV medications.
   Conclusions: AllyQuest represents a new, highly scalable solution that
   is well-suited to meet the specific prevention and care needs of HIV+
   YMSM. The development of this intervention is both timely and vital,
   given the urgency of the ongoing HIV epidemic among YMSM.},

Title = {A Game to Deal With Alcohol Abuse (Jib): Development and Game Experience
   Evaluation},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Alcohol abuse is the primary cause of (public) health
   problems in most parts of the world. However, it is undeniable that
   alcohol consumption is a practice that is widely accepted socially in
   many places, even being protected by law as a cultural and historical
   heritage. The issue of alcohol abuse is complex and urgent, and
   consequently, it is necessary to create innovative approaches such as
   the proposal explored in this study.
   Objective: This study aimed to explore the development and evaluation of
   a serious game for smartphones to present a novel approach to address
   the issue of alcohol abuse.
   Methods: A serious game was developed to instill the consequences of
   alcohol abuse into the player through experimentation in the game. In
   the game, the consequences of alcohol use are demonstrated by increasing
   the game speed that gives an illusion of fun but also leads to a
   premature death. The evaluation employed an assessment based on the
   Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the Game
   Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). The participants belonged to the
   university student's house.
   Results: The game development process has been presented, including its
   mechanics and gameplay. The game has the style of action and adventure
   games in which the player controls an indigenous avatar that can deflect
   or attack opponents coming his or her way. The game evaluation comprised
   an assessment based on 23 participants, aged 20 to 29 years. According
   to the AUDIT assessment, 18 participants reported having a low or
   nonexistent degree of alcohol dependence and 5 declared average
   dependence. Regarding their habit of playing games on smartphones, 9
   participants declared they have this habit of playing (habitual
   players), and among the 14 that did not have this habit of playing
   (nonhabitual players), 3 participants declared not having a smartphone
   at all. The GEQ core assessment showed a higher positive affect among
   the participants with a habit of playing games, scoring 2.80 (habitual
   players) on a scale of 4.0 versus 1.61 (nonhabitual players), and higher
   tension as an opposite relationship of 0.81 (nonhabitual players) versus
   0.37 (habitual players). The overall GEQ evaluation showed that the game
   presents a more positive than negative affect on all users, besides
   showing the other desirable characteristics of serious games.
   Conclusions: We present a new way of dealing with the issue of alcohol
   abuse through a game designed for smartphones. It promotes an overall
   positive user experience, having a greater impact on users accustomed to
   games. The proposed approach has its niche, though it is still a
   minority in the evaluated population. Further research should explore
   new game features, such as new styles, to make the game more attractive
   to a wider audience, in addition to performing an in-depth study on the
   effects of playing it.},

Title = {Breathing as an Input Modality in a Gameful Breathing Training App
   (Breeze 2): Development and Evaluation Study},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Slow-paced breathing training can have positive effects on
   physiological and psychological well-being. Unfortunately, use
   statistics indicate that adherence to breathing training apps is low.
   Recent work suggests that gameful breathing training may help overcome
   this challenge.
   Objective: This study aimed to introduce and evaluate the gameful
   breathing training app Breeze 2 and its novel real-time breathing
   detection algorithm that enables the interactive components of the app.
   Methods: We developed the breathing detection algorithm by using deep
   transfer learning to detect inhalation, exhalation, and nonbreathing
   sounds (including silence). An additional heuristic prolongs detected
   exhalations to stabilize the algorithm's predictions. We evaluated
   Breeze 2 with 30 participants (women: n=14, 47\%; age: mean 29.77, SD
   7.33 years). Participants performed breathing training with Breeze 2 in
   2 sessions with and without headphones. They answered questions
   regarding user engagement (User Engagement Scale Short Form {[}UES-SF]),
   perceived effectiveness (PE), perceived relaxation effectiveness, and
   perceived breathing detection accuracy. We used Wilcoxon signed-rank
   tests to compare the UES-SF, PE, and perceived relaxation effectiveness
   scores with neutral scores. Furthermore, we correlated perceived
   breathing detection accuracy with actual multi-class balanced accuracy
   to determine whether participants could perceive the actual breathing
   detection performance. We also conducted a repeated-measure ANOVA to
   investigate breathing detection differences in balanced accuracy with
   and without the heuristic and when classifying data captured from
   headphones and smartphone microphones. The analysis controlled for
   potential between-subject effects of the participants' sex.
   Results: Our results show scores that were significantly higher than
   neutral scores for the UES-SF (W=459; P<.001), PE (W=465; P<.001), and
   perceived relaxation effectiveness (W=358; P<.001). Perceived breathing
   detection accuracy correlated significantly with the actual multi-class
   balanced accuracy (r=0.51; P<.001). Furthermore, we found that the
   heuristic significantly improved the breathing detection balanced
   accuracy (F-1,(25)=6.23; P=.02) and that detection performed better on
   data captured from smartphone microphones than than on data from
   headphones (F-1,F-25=17.61; P<.001). We did not observe any significant
   between-subject effects of sex. Breathing detection without the
   heuristic reached a multi-class balanced accuracy of 74\% on the
   collected audio recordings.
   Conclusions: Most participants (28/30, 93\%) perceived Breeze 2 as
   engaging and effective. Furthermore, breathing detection worked well for
   most participants, as indicated by the perceived detection accuracy and
   actual detection accuracy. In future work, we aim to use the collected
   breathing sounds to improve breathing detection with regard to its
   stability and performance. We also plan to use Breeze 2 as an
   intervention tool in various studies targeting the prevention and
   management of noncommunicable diseases.},

Journal = {JMIR HUMAN FACTORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Background: In the last decade, the use of technology-based sexual
   health education has increased. Multiple studies have shown the
   feasibility of technology-based interventions, while a subset has also
   shown efficacy in improving youths' sexual health outcomes such as
   increased condom use and knowledge. However, little is known about
   health educators' experiences in integrating technology to augment
   sexual health curricula.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the perceptions and
   experiences of health educators regarding the incorporation of
   technology into a sexual health education program designed for
   underserved youth in Fresno County, California, and to identify
   facilitators and challenges to incorporating technology into the
   in-person curriculum.
   Methods: This implementation study used data collected as part of a
   cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate In the Know (ITK), an
   in-person sexual health education curriculum that includes
   technology-based content, such as a resource locator, videos, and games,
   which can be accessed through a mobile app or website. Data from
   implementation logs from each cohort (n=51) and annual interviews (n=8)
   with health educators were analyzed to assess the health educators'
   experiences using the technology and adaptations made during the
   implementation.
   Results: The health educators reported that technological issues
   affected implementation to some degree: 87\% of the time in the first
   year, which decreased to 47\% in the third year as health educators'
   familiarity with the app increased and functionality improved.
   Technology issues were also more common in non-school settings.
   Successes and challenges in 3 domains emerged: managing technology,
   usability of the ITK app, and youth engagement. The health educators
   generally had positive comments about the app and youth engagement with
   the technology-based content and activities; however, they also noted
   certain barriers to adolescents' use of the mobile app including limited
   data storage and battery life on mobile phones.
   Conclusions: Health educators require training and support to optimize
   technology as a resource for engaging with youth and providing sensitive
   information. Although technology is often presented as a solution to
   reach underserved populations, educational programs should consider the
   technological needs and limitations of the participants, educators, and
   settings.},

Title = {Serious Game on a Smartphone for Adolescents Undergoing Hemodialysis:
   Development and Evaluation},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {78-88},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Adolescents with chronic kidney disease have a hard time
   adhering to hemodialysis as a therapy, indicating a need to establish
   new alternatives for motivation and adherence to treatment.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a
   serious game to stimulate and motivate adolescents undergoing
   hemodialysis. Methods: We describe the technological production followed
   by a qualitative analysis. We invited 8 adolescents undergoing
   hemodialysis in the city Goiania, located in the midwest of Brazil, to
   participate. The final convenience sample included 7 (87.5\% of the
   target population) adolescents. The process was conducted in 3 phases:
   creation of a serious game, evaluation of its use, and observation of
   its motivating effect on behavioral modification with a focus on
   acquiring the necessary competence for self-care.
   Results: An app (Bim) in the modality of a serious game was developed to
   be used during hemodialysis; the player was encouraged to take care of a
   character with daily actions during his or her treatment. The game was
   made available to adolescents aged 10-14 years. Mobile devices were
   offered during the hemodialysis treatment for a period of 30-40 minutes,
   3 times a week for 60 days. The usage definitions of the game were
   freely chosen by the participants. The qualitative evaluation of the use
   of the Bim app showed that it encompasses scenarios and activities that
   enable the exercise of daily actions for the treatment of patients. The
   behavioral evaluation showed that the Bim app worked as a motivating
   stimulus for behavioral adherence to hemodialysis requirements.
   Conclusions: The easy-to-access app interface showed good operability
   for its users. The description of the character and proposed activities
   contributed to motivation and ability to cope with hemodialysis care.},

Title = {Video-based tools to enhance nurses' geriatric knowledge: A development
   and pilot study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {90},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: The need for health care professionals with geriatric
   knowledge is expected to increase due to aging of society. Educational
   tools that fit the specific learning styles of nurses and nursing
   students might be useful for this. Serioussoap.nl (available in Dutch
   and English) is an educational tool that integrates video-based gaming
   and storytelling, and it might be an effective way to improve the
   geriatric knowledge of nurses or nursing students.
   Objectives: To investigate the effect of Serioussoap.nl on the geriatric
   knowledge of nurses and nursing students, and to evaluate its usability.
   Design: We conducted a development and an explorative pilot study, using
   a pretest posttest quantitative design to investigate the effect of
   Serioussoap.nl on geriatric knowledge. A qualitative approach was used
   to evaluate its usability.
   Participants and setting: Three vocational nursing schools (n = 119
   second/third year students), one baccalaureate nursing university (n =
   77 first year vocational nurses) and one home-care organization (n = 44
   vocational nurses) in the Netherlands participated in the quantitative
   study, and 94 vocational students participated in the qualitative study.
   Methods: We measured the effect on geriatric knowledge with the
   Knowledge of Older People Questionnaire (KOP-Q, score 0-30). The
   qualitative study included observations of 94 participants while they
   played Serioussoap.nl, four semi-structured focus groups and eleven
   individual interviews.
   Results: The study demonstrated a significant increase of geriatric
   knowledge of 7.8\% (+2.3 score on the KOP-Q, 95\% Confidence Interval
   (1.4-3.2, p < 0.001). The qualitative data showed that Serioussoap.nl
   contributed to the reflective learning-style and enhanced meaningful
   learning.
   Conclusion: Serioussoap.nl increased the students' geriatric knowledge
   and was perceived as a suitable and effective educational tool for
   vocational nursing students and nurses.},

Title = {THE INFORMAL USE OF THE SMARTPHONE BY ADOLESCENTS IN RESIDENTIAL CARE: A
   CHALLENGE TO PROMOTE THE SOCIO-EDUCATIVE INTERVENTION},
Journal = {EDUCACION XX1},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {459-482},
Abstract = {Currently, there is widespread social concern about the use of
   Information and Communication Technologies among adolescents,
   specifically regarding devices such as the Smartphone. The use of mobile
   phones has become popular in this group, having a different impact on
   their lives. In view of the fascination that this device produces on
   them, it is possible to carry out a study on its use. The main objective
   of this work is to know the patterns that are deduced from the informal
   use of the Smartphone as the starting point in the design and
   implementation of socio-educative intervention, particularly with
   adolescents who are part of the child welfare system, taking into
   account the vulnerability and complexity that surrounds this collective.
   This research is framed in the qualitative methodology, and is part of
   the narrative approach, based on the collection of data with the
   technique of the story and the interview. The results and conclusions
   reveal the existence of different use patterns of the mobile phone by
   adolescents. It should be noted that adolescents subject the use of the
   device to the constant use of certain apps, due to popularity, easy
   handle and free-of-charge system. The use of instant messaging systems
   apps is notorious, particularly WhatsApp and Snapchat in any age
   bracket. Instagram stands out as the social network that most teenagers
   use. In general, these applications are used for recreational purposes.
   Despite having playful content, the influence of video games is not
   relevant to the use of the Smartphone by the collective. Finally, it is
   important to emphasize the comunicative purpose with which the minors
   use the Smartphone, with the aim of keeping in touch with colleagues and
   sentimental partners.},

Title = {Strategies to promote the use of online health applications for early
   detection and raising awareness of chronic diseases among members of the
   general public: A systematic literature review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {162},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction: Engagement is essential to achieve intended outcomes of
   online interventions, but achieving such engagement is a key challenge
   for many researchers and practitioners. This systematic literature
   review aims to identify strategies and tools to promote the use of
   online health interventions for early detection and raising awareness of
   chronic diseases among the public, and to investigate the evidence
   regarding the effectiveness of such strategies.
   Materials and methods: We performed a systematic search of seven
   electronic databases: Embase, Medline All Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane
   Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Google
   Scholar. The study protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020200471).
   Results: The database search identified 8,526 articles, 47 were included
   in the review. Thirty-two studies reported strategies to promote the use
   of their online intervention, including online advertisements on social
   media (n = 17), a dating application (n = 10), and a website (n = 3).
   Social media were not only used for promotion of the intervention, but
   also as main intervention platform (n = 18). Seven studies reported
   traditional promotion methods such as printed advertisement and
   (offline) campaigns. Twenty-seven studies reported strategies to keep
   users engaged, including reminders (n = 12), sharing of posts on social
   media (n = 4), rewards (n = 3), weekly group discussions (n = 2),
   follow-up phone calls (n = 2), interactive games (n = 1), monthly
   quizzes (n = 1), links to provision of a test kit (n = 1), and a
   deposit-return system (n = 1).
   Conclusions: No study conducted a formal evaluation of the effectiveness
   of the engagement strategies. Examining the effectiveness of engagement
   strategies is an important area for further research.},

Title = {Exploring the Impact of a Mobile Health Solution for Postpartum Pelvic
   Floor Muscle Training: Pilot Randomized Controlled Feasibility Study},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {Background: The postpartum period is a vulnerable time for the pelvic
   floor. Early implementation of pelvic floor muscle exercises,
   appropriately termed as pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), in the
   postpartum period has been advocated because of its established
   effectiveness. The popularity of mobile health (mHealth) devices
   highlights their perceived utility. The effectiveness of various mHealth
   technologies with claims to support pelvic floor health and fitness is
   yet to be substantiated through systematic inquiry.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the acceptability,
   feasibility, and potential effect on outcomes of an mHealth device
   purposed to facilitate pelvic floor muscle training among postpartum
   women.
   Methods: A 16-week mixed methods pilot study was conducted to evaluate
   outcomes and determine aspects of acceptability and feasibility of an
   mHealth device. All participants received standardized examination of
   their pelvic floor muscles and associated instruction on the correct
   performance of PFMT. Those randomized to the iBall intervention received
   instructions on its use. Schedules for utilization of the iBall and PFMT
   were not prescribed, but all participants were informed of the standard
   established recommendation of PFMT, which includes 3 sets of 10
   exercises, 3 to 4 times a week, for the duration of the intervention
   period. Quantitative data included the measurement of pelvic floor
   muscle parameters (strength, endurance, and coordination) following the
   PERFECT assessment scheme: Incontinence Impact Questionnaire scores and
   the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) scores. Aspects of
   acceptability and feasibility were collected through one-to-one
   interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using Thorne's
   interpretive description approach.
   Results: A total of 23 women with a mean age of 32.2 years were
   randomized to an intervention group (n=13) or a control group (n=10).
   Both groups improved on all measures. The only statistically significant
   change was the UDI-6 score within both groups at 16 weeks compared with
   baseline. There was no statistically significant difference between the
   intervention group and control group on any outcomes. Most participants
   using the iBall (n=10, 77\%) indicated value in the concept of the
   mHealth solution. Technical difficulties (n=10, 77\%), a cumbersome
   initiation process (n=8, 61\%), and discomfort from the device (n=8,
   61\%) were reasons impeding intervention acceptability. Most
   participants (n=17, 74\%) indicated that the initial assessment and
   training was more useful than the mHealth solution, a tenet that was
   echoed by all control group participants.
   Conclusions: Our pilot study demonstrated the potential for mHealth
   solution-enhanced PFMT in the early postpartum period. Usability issues
   in hardware and software hindered feasibility and acceptance by the
   participants. Our findings can inform the redesign of mHealth solutions
   that may be of value if acceptability and feasibility issues can be
   overcome.},

Title = {Computer games to teach hygiene: an evaluation of the e-Bug junior game},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {66},
Number = {5},
Pages = {V39-V44},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Handwashing, respiratory hygiene and antibiotic resistance remain major
   public health concerns. In order to facilitate an effective outcome when
   teaching the basic principles of hand and respiratory hygiene,
   educational interventions should first target school children. As
   computer games are ubiquitous in most children's lives, e-Bug developed
   computer games targeted at teaching children handwashing, respiratory
   hygiene and antibiotic resistance. The games were designed for two
   target audiences: junior school children (9-12 year olds); and senior
   school children (13-15 year olds). Between May and August 2009, the
   finalized junior game underwent an evaluation in three UK schools (in
   Glasgow, Gloucester and London), involving 62 children in the schools
   and similar to 1700 players accessing the junior game online. The e-Bug
   junior game consists of a number of levels of play, each of which
   promotes a set of learning outcomes (LOs). These LOs, complementary to
   those in the e-Bug packs, are expressed through the game mechanics (the
   rules of the game) rather than through story or dialogue. Although the
   junior game's evaluation demonstrated a statistically significant change
   in the knowledge for only a small number of given LOs, because many
   children had the required knowledge already before playing the game,
   this is e-Bug's first statistical study on the junior game and the first
   comprehensive evaluation of its kind. Future work includes a
   re-examination of the quiz-style questionnaires utilized in this study
   and an exploration of the potential knowledge change acquired strictly
   through engagement.},

Title = {Design and Development of the ``<i>POD Adventures</i>{''} Smartphone
   Game: A Blended Problem-Solving Intervention for Adolescent Mental
   Health in India},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Introduction: Digital technology platforms offer unparalleled
   opportunities to reach vulnerable adolescents at scale and overcome many
   barriers that exist around conventional service provision. This paper
   describes the design and development of POD Adventures, a blended
   problem-solving game-based intervention for adolescents with or at risk
   of anxiety, depression and conduct difficulties in India. This
   intervention was developed as part of the PRemlum for ADolEscents
   (PRIDE) research programme, which aims to establish a suite of
   transdiagnostic psychological interventions organized around a stepped
   care system in Indian secondary schools.
   Methods and Materials: Intervention development followed a
   person-centered approach consisting of four iterative activities: (i)
   review of recent context-specific evidence on mental health needs and
   preferences for the target population of school-going Indian
   adolescents, including a multiple stakeholder analysis of school
   counseling priorities and pilot studies of a brief problem-solving
   intervention; (ii) new focus group discussions with N = 46 student
   participants and N = 8 service providers; (iii) co-design workshops with
   N = 22 student participants and N = 8 service providers; and (iv)
   user-testing with N = 50 student participants. Participants were aged
   12-17 years and recruited from local schools in New Delhi and Goa,
   including a subgroup with self-identified mental health needs (N = 6).
   Results: Formative data from existing primary sources, new focus groups
   and co-design workshops supported a blended format for delivering a
   brief problem-solving intervention, with counselors supporting use of a
   game-based app on ``offline{''} smartphones. User-testing with
   prototypes identified a need for simplification of language, use of
   concrete examples of concepts and practice elements to enhance
   engagement. There were also indications that participants most valued
   relatability and interactivity within real-world stories with judicious
   support from an in-app guide. The final prototype comprised a set of
   interactive and gamified vignettes and a structured set of
   problem-solving questions to consolidate and generalize learning while
   encouraging real-world application.
   Discussion: Findings shaped the design of POD Adventures and its
   delivery as an open-access blended intervention for secondary school
   students with a felt need for psychological support, consistent with an
   early intervention paradigm. A randomized controlled trial is planned to
   evaluate processes and impacts of POD Adventures when delivered for
   help-seeking students in low-resource school settings.},

Title = {mHealth to reduce HIV-related stigma among youth in the United States: a
   scoping review},
Journal = {MHEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Multiple intersecting stigmas and discrimination related to sex, gender,
   HIV, and race/ethnicity may challenge HIV prevention and treatment
   service utilization, particularly among youth. This scoping review
   describes recent and ongoing innovative mobile health (mHealth)
   interventions among youth in the United States that aim to reduce stigma
   as an outcome or as part of the intervention model. To identify examples
   of stigma-mitigation via mHealth, we searched peer-reviewed published
   literature using keyword strategies related to mHealth, HIV, stigma, and
   youth (ages 10 to 29). We identified eleven articles that met our
   inclusion criteria, including three describing data from two randomized
   controlled trials (RCTs), five describing pilot studies, one describing
   the process evaluation of an ongoing intervention, one describing
   formative work for intervention development, and one published study
   protocol for an ongoing intervention. We review these articles, grouped
   by HIV prevention and care continuum stages, and describe the mHealth
   approach used, including telehealth, simulation video games, motion
   comics, smartphone applications (apps), social media forums, online
   video campaigns, video vignettes, and a computerized behavioral learning
   module. Four studies focused on preventing primary acquisition through

Title = {Validity and reliability of an accelerometer-based assessgame to
   quantify upper limb selective voluntary motor control},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Introduction Current clinical assessments measure selective voluntary
   motor control (SVMC) on an ordinal scale. We introduce a playful,
   interval-scaled method to assess SVMC in children with brain lesions and
   evaluate its validity and reliability. Methods Thirty-one neurologically
   intact children (median {[}1st-3rd quartile]: 11.6 years {[}8.5-13.9])
   and 33 patients (12.2 years {[}8.8-14.9]) affected by upper motor neuron
   lesions with mild to moderate impairments participated. Using
   accelerometers, they played a movement tracking game (assessgame) with
   isolated joint movements (shoulder, elbow, lower arm
   {[}pro-/supination], wrist, and fingers), yielding an accuracy score.
   Involuntary movements were recorded simultaneously and resulted in an
   involuntary movement score. Both scores were normalized to the
   performance of 33 neurologically intact adults (32.5 years {[}27.9;
   38.3]), which represented physiological movement patterns. We correlated
   the assessgame outcomes with the Manual Ability Classification System,
   Selective Control of the Upper Extremity Scale, and a therapist rating
   of involuntary movements. Furthermore, a robust ANCOVA was performed
   with age as covariate, comparing patients to their healthy peers at the
   age levels of 7.5, 9, 10.5, 12, and 15 years. Intraclass correlation
   coefficients and smallest real differences indicated relative and
   absolute reliability. Results Correlations (Kendall/Spearman) for the
   accuracy score were tau = 0.29 (p = 0.035; Manual Ability Classification
   System), rho = - 0.37 (p = 0.035; Selective Control of the Upper
   Extremity Scale), and rho = 0.64 (p < 0.001; therapist rating).
   Correlations for the involuntary movement metric were tau = 0.37 (p =
   0.008), rho = - 0.55 (p = 0.001), and rho = 0.79 (p < 0.001),
   respectively. The robust ANCOVAs revealed that patients performed
   significantly poorer than their healthy peers in both outcomes and at
   all age levels except for the dominant/less affected arm, where the
   youngest age group did not differ significantly. Robust intraclass
   correlation coefficients and smallest real differences were 0.80 and
   1.02 (46\% of median patient score) for the accuracy and 0.92 and 2.55
   (58\%) for involuntary movements, respectively. Conclusion While this
   novel assessgame is valid, the reliability might need to be improved.
   Further studies are needed to determine whether the assessgame is
   sensitive enough to detect changes in SVMC after a surgical or
   therapeutic intervention.},

Title = {Waking up in the morning (WUIM): A transmedia project for daily living
   skills training},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY AND DISABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {137-161},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the most serious concerns of parents, caregivers,
   teachers and therapists is children's independent living, particularly
   of those with special educational needs (SEN). Purpose-built programs
   for the acquisition of independent living skills are considered a
   priority in special education settings. The main problem is the
   inefficacy of detached interventions to meet the needs of as many
   students as possible.
   OBJECTIVE: Our response is to create transmedia applications for
   inclusive learning environments. To this end, we have taken a
   participatory design approach to develop a project for Daily Living
   Skills Training by combining special education pedagogies, filmic
   methods, game design and innovative technologies. In this paper, we
   present the design and development ofWaking up In the Morning (WUIM),
   and its improvement through user-based and expert-based evaluations by
   students, therapists and developers. The main research purpose is to
   confirm if: (1) the final products of the WUIM project could be
   educational resources for students with SEN and (2) the common gaming
   experience could promote collaborative learning, regardless of students'
   cognitive profile.
   METHODS: During the alpha phase, we developed and improved WUIM. In July
   2020, we implemented and evaluated WUIM in special education settings
   (beta-phase). More specifically, a quantitative and qualitative
   formative evaluation was conducted with children who have developmental
   disabilities (N = 11), their therapists (N = 7) and developers (N = 2).
   Methods of data collection included questionnaires filled in by
   therapists and developers, participant observation by researchers and
   interviews with children.
   RESULTS: The results of the formative evaluation were generally positive
   regarding four-factor groups that shape the learning experience:
   Content, Technical characteristics, User state of mind, Characteristics
   that allow learning. After the design team reviewed the potential users
   and experts' comments that were mainly related to the user interface,
   the application was improved.
   CONCLUSIONS: The two hypotheses have been largely confirmed. Overall, we
   propose a simplified development process that showcases the importance
   of arts-based methods and aesthetics which deliver representational
   fidelity. The study reveals the necessity of developing transmedia
   learning materials to meet each individual's needs.},

Title = {The Notijoves Project: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial About
   New Communication Technologies and Gamification to Promote Partner
   Notification of Sexually Transmitted Infections Among Young People},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: An increase in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as
   well as an increase in the use of new information and communication
   technologies among young people in Catalonia is the inspiration behind
   the idea of designing a smartphone app to promote partner notification
   of STIs.
   Objective: The main objective of this study is to design a Web-based
   tool adapted to smartphones for partner notification of STIs among youth
   who are 16 to 24 years old. Additionally, the objective is to evaluate
   the Web-based tool's role in increasing the patient referral partner
   notification.
   Methods: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with a
   proportional stratification of the sample by center and random
   allocation of participants to the 3 arms of the study (simple Web-based
   intervention, game Web-based intervention, and control). This study is
   being conducted by midwives, gynecologists, and physicians in the sexual
   and reproductive areas of the primary health care centers.
   Results: The primary outcome measure is the number and proportion of
   partner notifications. Additional outcome measures are the yield of
   early diagnosis and treatment of those exposed and infected,
   acceptability, barriers, and preferences for partner notification.
   Expected results include an increase in the yield of partner
   notification, early diagnosis and treatment among youth using Web-based
   interventions compared with those receiving the traditional advice to
   notify, and a description of sexual networks among those participating
   in the study.
   Conclusions: The Notijoves is expected to have a sustainable positive
   impact in the partner notification practice among youth and contribute
   to increasing the awareness of STI prevention.},

Title = {The REThink Online Therapeutic Game: A Usability Study},
Journal = {CHILDREN-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Children and adolescents' help-seeking behaviors are often
   limited by fear, uncertainty, and stigma, as well as challenges with
   finding the right intervention, help, and a lack of familiarity with the
   process. A promising direction for the development of therapeutic
   interventions targeted at children is embedding them into gamified
   interventions, known as therapeutic or serious games. The aim of this
   paper is to describe the protocol of the beta REThink therapeutic game
   and to evaluate the usability of the game in a sample of children and
   adolescents. Methods: The study was delivered in schools, where 137
   children and adolescents aged between 9 and 16 years old played the
   levels of the REThink game, followed by filling in the usability
   questionnaire. Findings: The results show above average evaluations for
   all levels of the game, for every dimension evaluated, namely
   presence/immersion, enjoyment, learning effectiveness, narratives, goal
   clarity, adequacy of learning material, and motivation. This study
   contributes to the literature on the usability of cognitive behavioral
   therapy-based therapeutic games for improvements in the emotion
   regulation abilities of children and adolescents, which can guide
   researchers interested in testing the REThink game in different
   protocols, as well to encourage its use by mental health specialists and

Title = {Profiles and psychological indicators related to dyspareunia and
   vaginismus: Qualitative study. Part two},
Journal = {SALUD MENTAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {437-449},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {One target of psychology of health is the quest for specificity when
   detecting factors related to psychological disorders, among which there
   are female sexual dysfunctions showing associated pain: dyspareunia and
   vaginismus (not caused by medical disease).
   Dyspareunia is the presence of genital pain during sexual intercourse
   and is related to psychological or relational factors. Vaginismus is
   characterized by spasms in the muscles of the vaginal entrance, making
   it difficult or impossible to perform coitus; the woman can be sexually
   aroused, responsive and enjoying sexual games, she can even reach her
   orgasm, as long as there is no penetration. Of all the causes mentioned,
   the following are recognized: incapacity to let go to the erotic
   experience, fear to failure, cultural influence predisposing sexual
   conflict, anxiety and shame, as well as couple problems.
   However, specificity is lacking in the factors related to each one of
   these sexual dysfunctions in order to provide elements generating
   intervention strategies.
   Objective
   The objective is to detect new indicators with the purpose of having a
   better understanding of why an individual exercises sexuality in such a
   way that it makes her have a proper sexual response and why, in other
   situations, the sexual response shows alterations leading to dyspareunia
   or vaginismus.
   Four are the specific objectives:
   1. Identification of current indicators that have an influence in sexual
   dysfunctions of the participants.
   2. Identification of indicators that have had an influence in the
   unsatisfactory development of sexuality of the participants.
   3. Identification of elements of perception of the participants in the
   couple life of their parents that may have had an impact on their
   sexuality.
   4. Identification of indicators that, within the sexual management
   provided by the family, had an impact in the sexual life of the
   participants.
   Material and methods
   The qualitative-interpretative method was used, in the form of an
   exploratory case-study. The institution where the study took place was
   the Department of Psychology of the National Institute of Perinatology
   (INPerlER).
   The sample was constituted by three participants, all of them patients
   from the institution; they had to comply with certain inclusion criteria
   of the study. Any physical problem that could have caused the sexual
   dysfunction was discarded. The first participant did not show any sexual
   dysfunction (NSD), the second one showed dyspareunia (D) and the third
   one showed vaginismus M. We used a semi-structured, focalized, in-depth
   interview. Interviews took place after having signed a letter of
   informed consent, accordingly to the ethical institutional requirements,
   and we also got an approval of recording the interview.
   We used the analysis of content with an empiric, exploratory
   orientation. Categories were organized accordingly with the specific
   objectives.
   Results
   The three participants were: NSD: 32 years old, five years of marriage.
   No sexual dysfunction. V: 36 years old, six years of marriage.
   Diagnosis: vaginismus. D: 33 years old, one year in free union.
   Diagnosis: dyspareunia.
   Data systematization was performed dividing the units of analysis by
   every participant and the parts of the most significative stories of
   every specific objective within its respective categories.
   In the analysis of categories we detected two conditions: internal and
   relational, as well as two types of indicators: risk indicators and
   protective indicators. What marked the difference was the dominium of
   the protective indicators over the risk indicators in the NSD
   participant.
   Among the more important risk indicators, we found feelings of
   disadvantage, uselessness and devaluating feelings, linked to a tendency
   to submissive behavior, as a consequence of remote causes such as having
   faced a double moral in the family: on the one hand erotized family
   bonds during infancy and, on the other hand, prohibitions and stiffness
   towards any sexual curiosity or manifestation, apart from a poor
   socialization.
   The conflict between desire and sexual prohibition generates confusion
   in the identification of sensations, setting a painful, fearful
   association to sexuality, even more so if this landscape is complicated
   with other elements such as violence and carelessness.
   Other elements found as a consequence of the aforementioned include
   self-inflicted violence, annulment of desire, lack of self-care and
   interacting problems with the opposite sex in everyday life. All of this
   leads to an incapacity of exerting a satisfactory sexual life, drifting
   towards secondary fears when feeling disadvantageous while interacting
   with the couple; this, in great extent, determines the conflicts, which
   may be either a cause or a consequence of the sexual problem.
   Confusion also arises when trying to identify whether problems are
   internal or external, thence conductual responses tend to complicate the
   relationship. In both sexual dysfunctions we find a specific type of
   frustration, since desire, excitement and orgasm are present, but coitus
   cannot be performed in a satisfactory way.
   The following are the more important protective indicators: conductual
   assertive responses, clarity in the affections, situation of the
   problems, search for sexual information, openness to family
   communication and with the couple, a couple's differential place, plus
   the search of satisfaction of sexuality and self care. Among the
   indicators shared we found: limited or null sexual education, poor
   communication in the family nucleus, and gender stereotypes highly
   polarized between parents, among others.
   Conclusions
   We corroborate in this study that it is the combination of specific
   elements which contributes to the presence of these two sexual
   dysfunctions, since the psychological world has many intertwined
   streams, intervention models cannot be centered only in sexual
   techniques, but they should also consider the indicators related to such
   alterations.
   Finally, it must be pointed out that the results of this phase are the
   product of an exploratory study, opening the gates to new lines of
   research.},

Title = {Mobile Phone Intervention to Reduce Youth Suicide in Rural Communities:
   Field Test},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death among 10- to
   19-year-olds in the United States, with 5\% to 8\% attempting suicide
   each year. Suicide risk rises significantly during early adolescence and
   is higher in rural and underserved communities. School-based universal
   prevention programs offer a promising way of reducing suicide by
   providing strategies for emotion regulation and encouraging help-seeking
   behaviors and youth-adult connectedness. However, such programs
   frequently run into difficulties in trying to engage a broad range of
   students. Text messaging is a dominant medium of communication among
   youths, and studies show both efficacy and uptake in text messaging
   interventions aimed at adolescents. Text-based interventions may, thus,
   offer a means for school-based universal prevention programs to engage
   adolescents who would otherwise be difficult to reach.
   Objective: We field tested Text4Strength, an automated, interactive text
   messaging intervention that seeks to reach a broad range of early
   adolescents in rural communities. Text4Strength extends Sources of
   Strength, a peer-led school suicide prevention program, by encouraging
   emotion regulation, help-seeking behaviors, and youth-adult
   connectedness in adolescents. The study tested the appeal and
   feasibility of Text4Strength and its potential to extend universal
   school-based suicide prevention.
   Methods: We field tested Text4Strength with 42 ninth-grade students.
   Over 9 weeks, students received 28 interactive message sequences across
   9 categories (Sources of Strength introduction, positive friend,
   mentors, family support, healthy activities, generosity, spirituality,
   medical access, and emotion regulation strategies). The message
   sequences included games, requests for advice, questions about students'
   own experiences, and peer testimonial videos. We measured baseline
   mental health characteristics, frequency of replies, completion of
   sequences and video viewing, appeal to students, and their perception of
   having benefited from the program.
   Results: Of the 42 participating students, 38 (91\%) responded to at
   least one sequence and 22 (52\%) responded to more than a third of the
   sequences. The proportion of students who completed multistep sequences
   they had started ranged from 35\% (6/17) to 100\% (3/3 to 28/28), with
   responses dropping off when more than 4 replies were needed. With the
   exception of spirituality and generosity, each of the content areas
   generated at least a moderate number of student replies from both boys
   and girls. Students with higher and lower levels of risk and distress
   interacted with the sequences at similar rates. Contrary to
   expectations, few students watched videos. Students viewed the
   intervention as useful-even those who rarely responded to messages. More
   than 70\% found the texts useful (3 items, n range 29-34) and 90\% (36)
   agreed the program should be repeated.
   Conclusions: Text4Strength offers a potentially engaging way to extend
   school-based interventions that promote protective factors for suicide.
   Text4Strength is ready to be revised, based on findings and student
   feedback from this field test, and rigorously tested for efficacy.},

Abstract = {HIV education programs are needed to address risk-taking behavior for
   adolescents. The purpose of our study was to use the World Health
   Organization's Rapid Assessment and Response (RAR) method to design a
   community-based, cultural- and age-appropriate HIV prevention program
   for adolescents in Bangkok, Thailand. Adolescent single-gender-specific
   focus groups (n = 3; 28 participants) were used to gather
   reactions/ideas about program topics/approaches. An adult, mixed-gender
   group was held to review information identified by adolescents. Sessions
   were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Themes regarding HIV content
   and the process of implementation emerged from a qualitative content
   analysis of the data. Community representatives recommended
   incorporation of HIV information and risk-prevention skills. Information
   delivery suggestions included small group discussions, interactive
   games/role-playing, program materials/terminology, and HIV-infected
   program facilitators. Community members provided critical input toward
   an HIV prevention program tailored to meet adolescents' unique

Abstract = {Background: Video games are interactive technologies able to support
   children in health promotion, behavior changes, and chronic disease
   self-management. The use of health behavior change determinants in video
   game design can increase its effectiveness. This study describes the
   process of designing a video game for Brazilian children with T1D
   clarifying the use of health behavior change determinants that may
   influence self-management behaviors.
   Methods: This was a methodological study based on health behavior change
   theories and the user-centered design approach. The results of a
   qualitative study conducted with children aged 7 to 12years identified
   learning needs about knowledge on diabetes and self-care tasks which
   contribute to inappropriate behaviors. A Behavioral Diagnosis presented
   health behavior change determinants, capable of influencing children's
   learning needs and behaviors, that were considered to design The Heroes
   of Diabetes-the power of knowledge.
   Results: The results presented the process of designing 4 mini games
   with its description and theory foundation to reach children's lack of
   understanding about T1D, insulin's role, SMBG requirements, food groups
   and physical activity's role in glycemic control. Knowledge, goal
   settings, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation determinants were related
   with video games design features.
   Conclusions: The findings support the use of health behavior change
   determinants into video game design as a guide to achieve children
   learning needs and that might influence self-management behaviors.},

   evaluated on a fundamental topic such as set theory and its operations
   through Venn diagrams. This, by means of the incorporation of a playful
   technological tool called Kahoot, which allows to create presentations /
   interactive games in which a diverse number of people can participate at
   the same time, from two people to a large number, through electronic
   devices. The objective was to awaken in the student interest in
   mastering mathematical subjects and in speeding up the speed of mental
   thinking through the competitive stimulus of comparing their knowledge
   with their peers. As a methodology, a field study was carried out based
   on the bibliographic review of the theoretical elements of interest, in
   which students who study the subject of Discrete Mathematics related to
   Systems and Computing Engineering careers were used as a sample, in the
   period 2018-2019, in a particular Latin American university. The
   preliminary results showed a total acceptance of Kahoot as an evaluative
   tool and a good percentage of correct answers related to the subject
   evaluated with that tool.},

Title = {FightHPV: Design and Evaluation of a Mobile Game to Raise Awareness
   About Human Papillomavirus and Nudge People to Take Action Against
   Cervical Cancer},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually
   transmitted infection globally. High-risk HPV types can cause cervical
   cancer, other anogenital cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer; low-risk HPV
   types can cause genital warts. Cervical cancer is highly preventable
   through HPV vaccination and screening; however, a lack of awareness and
   knowledge of HPV and these preventive strategies represents an important
   barrier to reducing the burden of the disease. The rapid development and
   widespread use of mobile technologies in the last few years present an
   opportunity to overcome this lack of knowledge and create new,
   effective, and modern health communication strategies.
   Objective: This study aimed to describe the development of a mobile app
   called FightHPV, a game-based learning tool that educates mobile
   technology users about HPV, the disease risks associated with HPV
   infection, and existing preventive methods.
   Methods: The first version of FightHPV was improved in a
   design-development-evaluation loop, which incorporated feedback from a
   beta testing study of 40 participants, a first focus group of 6
   participants aged between 40 and 50 years and a second focus group of 23
   participants aged between 16 and 18 years. Gameplay data from the beta
   testing study were collected using Google Analytics (Google), whereas
   feedback from focus groups was evaluated qualitatively. Of the 29 focus
   group participants, 26 returned self-administered questionnaires HPV
   knowledge before and after playing the game was evaluated in the 22
   participants from the second focus group who returned a questionnaire.
   Results: FightHPV communicates concepts about HPV, associated diseases
   and their prevention by representing relationships among 14 characters
   in 6 episodes of 10 levels each, with each level being represented by a
   puzzle. Main concepts were reinforced with text explanations. Beta
   testing revealed that many players either failed or had to retry several
   times before succeeding at the more difficult levels in the game. It
   also revealed that players gave up at around level 47 of 60, which
   prompted the redesign of FightHPV to increase accessibility to all
   episodes. Focus group discussions led to several improvements in the
   user experience and dissemination of health information in the game,
   such as making all episodes available from the beginning of the game and
   rewriting the information in a more appealing way. Among the 26 focus
   group participants who returned a questionnaire, all stated that
   FightHPV is an appealing educational tool, 69\% (18/26) reported that
   they liked the game, and 81\% (21/26) stated that the game was
   challenging. We observed an increase in HPV knowledge after playing the
   game (P=.001).
   Conclusions: FightHPV was easy to access, use, and it increased
   awareness about HPV infection, its consequences, and preventive
   measures. FightHPV can be used to educate people to take action against
   HPV and cervical cancer.},

Title = {Desirable Components for a Customized, Home-Based, Digital
   Care-Management App for Children and Young People With Long-Term,
   Chronic Conditions: A Qualitative Exploration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Mobile apps for mobile phones and tablet devices are widely
   used by children and young people aged 0-18 years with long-term health
   conditions, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), and their healthy
   peers for social networking or gaming. They are also poised to become a
   major source of health guidance. However, app development processes that
   are coproduced, rigorously developed, and evaluated to provide tailored,
   condition-specific, practical advice on day-to-day care management are
   seldom systematic or sufficiently described to enable replication.
   Furthermore, attempts to extrapolate to the real world are hampered by a
   poor understanding of the effects of key elements of app components.
   Therefore, effective and cost-effective novel, digital apps that will
   effectively and safely support care management are critical and timely.
   To inform development of such an app for children with CKD, a user
   requirements-gathering exercise was first needed.
   Objective: To explore the views of children with CKD, their parents, and
   health care professionals to inform future development of a
   child-focused, care-management app.
   Methods: Using age-and developmentally appropriate methods, we
   interviewed 36 participants: 5-10-year-olds (n=6), 11-14-year-olds
   (n=6), 15-18-year-olds (n=5), mothers (n=10), fathers (n=2), and health
   care professionals (n=7). Data were analyzed using Framework Analysis
   and behavior change theories.
   Results: Of the 27 interviews, 19 (70\%) interviews were individual and
   8 (30\%) were joint-5 out of 8 (63\%) joint interviews were with a child
   or young person and their parent, 1 out of 8 (13\%) were with a child
   and both parents, and 2 out of 8 (25\%) were with 2 professionals. Three
   key themes emerged to inform development of a software requirement
   specification for a future home-based, digital care-management app
   intervention: (1) Gaps in current online information and support, (2)
   Difficulties experienced by children with a long-term condition, and (3)
   Suggestions for a digital care-management app. Reported gaps included
   the fact that current online information is not usually appropriate for
   children as it is ``dry{''} and ``boring,{''}could be ``scary,{''} and
   was either hard to understand or not relevant to individuals'
   circumstances. For children, searching online was much less accessible
   than using a professional-endorsed mobile app. Children also reported
   difficulty explaining their condition to others, maintaining treatment
   adherence, coping with feeling isolated, and with trying to live a
   ``normal{''} life. There was recognition that a developmentally
   appropriate, CKD-specific app could support the process of explaining
   the condition to healthy peers, reducing isolation, adhering to
   care-management plans, and living a ``normal{''} life. Participants
   recommended a range of media and content to include in a tailored,
   interactive, age-and developmentally appropriate app. For example, the
   user would be able to enter their age and diagnosis so that only
   age-appropriate and condition-specific content is displayed.
   Conclusions: Future development of a digital app that meets the
   identified information and support needs and preferences of children
   with CKD will maximize its utility, thereby augmenting CKD caregiving
   and optimizing outcomes.},

Title = {A Design-Led Theory of Change for a Mobile Game App (Go Nisha Go) for
   Adolescent Girls in India: Multimix Methodology Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {Background: India has one of the largest adolescent populations in the
   world. Yet adolescents, particularly adolescent girls, have limited
   access to correct sexual and reproductive health information and
   services. The context in which adolescent girls live is one of gender
   inequity where they contend with early marriage and early pregnancy and
   have few opportunities for quality education and labor force
   participation. The digital revolution has expanded the penetration of
   mobile phones across India, increasingly being used by adolescent girls.
   Health interventions are also moving onto digital platforms. Evidence
   has shown that applications of game elements and game-based learning can
   be powerful tools in behavior change and health interventions. This
   provides a unique opportunity, particularly for the private sector, to
   reach and empower adolescent girls directly with information, products,
   and services in a private and fun manner. Objective: The objective of
   this paper is to describe how a design-led Theory of Change (ToC) was
   formulated for a mobile game app that is not only underpinned by
   theories of various behavior change models but also identifies variables
   and triggers for in-game behavioral intentions that can be tracked and
   measured within the game and validated through a rigorous post-gameplay
   outcome evaluation. Methods: We describe the use of a multimix
   methodology to formulate a ToC informing behavioral frameworks and
   co-design approaches in our proof-of-concept product development
   journey. This process created a statement of hypothesis and ``pathways
   to impact{''} with a continuous, cumulative, and iterative design
   process that included key stakeholders in the production of a smartphone
   app. With theoretical underpinnings of social behavior and modeling
   frameworks, systematic research, and other creative methods, we
   developed a design-led ToC pathway that can delineate complex and
   multidisciplinary outputs for measuring impact. Results: The statement
   of hypothesis that emerged posits that ``If girls virtually experience
   the outcomes of choices that they make for their avatar in the mobile
   game, then they can make informed decisions that direct the course of
   their own life.{''} Four learning pathways (DISCOVER, PLAY, DECIDE, and
   ACT) are scaffolded on 3 pillars of evidence, engagement, and evaluation
   to support the ToC-led framework. It informs decision-making and life
   outcomes through game-based objectives and in-game triggers that offer
   direct access to information, products, and services. Conclusions: This
   approach of using a multimix methodology for identifying varied and
   multidisciplinary pathways to change is of particular interest to
   measuring the impact of innovations, especially digital products, that
   do not necessarily conform with traditional behavioral change models or
   standard co-design approaches. We also explain the benefits of using
   iterative and cumulative inputs to integrate ongoing user feedback,
   while identifying pathways to various impacts, and not limiting it to
   only the design and development phase.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Pathology learning for medical undergraduate students is a
   challenging task. Kahoot! is a mobile game-based online digital
   formative assessment tool that can engage students in its learning. This
   study is the first to assess the effect of Kahoot! use on Pathology
   learning outside classroom using a comparative group with assessment
   done at the end of the course. Methods: The study was carried out on the
   first-year Pathology students at Helwan University, Faculty of Medicine,
   after ending a basic Pathology course. The study is a retrospective
   quasi-experimental quantitative study. Academic performance of students
   in Pathology was compared between Kahoot! and non-Kahoot! users (55
   students each). In addition, an online survey was introduced to the 55
   Kahoot! user students to investigate their perceptions on it. Survey and
   test score data were analyzed by appropriate tests using IBM-SPSS
   (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). The level of significance was
   P Results: Kahoot! enhanced Pathology understanding (83.6\%), retaining
   knowledge (87.3\%), made learning fun and motivating (89.1\%). Other
   mentioned advantages of Kahoot! were practicing for exam (40\%), simple
   and easy to use (36.4\%), competitive (18.2\%), self confidence booster
   (10.9\%), forming a comprehensive image of the lecture (9\%), quick
   (9\%), and imagining skills booster (5.5\%). Mentioned disadvantages
   included no explanation for the answers to questions (20\%). A quarter
   of the students stated that the time limit for the questions was short
   (27.3\%). Kahoot! use was significantly associated with better Pathology
   academic performance (P = 0.001), and it was not related to the general
   academic performance of the students (P = 0.06). Most users (85.4\%)
   recommended its continuous future use. Conclusions: The study offers an
   endorsement to the use of Kahoot! for gamifying formative assessment of
   Pathology and can provide a basis for the design of an online Kahoot!
   -based continuous formative assessment plans implemented
   outside-classroom in the Pathology curricula.},

   Culture-Related Preferences Toward Educational Games Promoting Safer Sex},
Journal = {GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Pages = {357-365},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective: Comprehensive sex education programs specifically designed
   for adolescents and young adults that take into account gender norms and
   cultural background have shown promise as a means of countering the high
   sexually transmitted infection rate in young people. Recently, digital
   gaming interventions delivered on computers or mobile devices have
   emerged as another way to promote safer sex behavior in a young
   population. Tailoring these computer-based interventions to their target
   population has been recognized to increase positive behavior outcomes.
   In this qualitative study, we investigated whether young female and male
   adults from two different cultural backgrounds (all living in Germany)
   would have different preferences and needs in relation to an educational
   game promoting safer sex. Materials and Methods: We conducted four
   semistructured focus group interviews comprising open-ended questions
   with male and female participants who had either a German or a Turkish
   background. In total, 20 individuals, aged between 18 and 22 years, from
   two socially diverse and ethnically mixed vocational schools in Germany
   participated. Results: Independent of cultural background and gender,
   participants preferred a real-world design with a first-person visual
   perspective over a fantasy-like third-person perspective. Furthermore,
   they preferred highly customizable avatars. All participants mentioned
   the importance of including an alcohol-intoxicated avatar and most
   participants wanted there to be additional information available about
   various safer sex approaches and about the use of different barrier
   protection methods. Males and females reported similar preferences for
   the design of an educational game promoting safer sex, with the only
   difference being exactly how the topic of having sexual intercourse
   should be addressed in the game. Males preferred a direct approach,
   whereas females had a preference for treating this subject more
   sympathetically. Conclusion: Educational games offer anonymity and can
   provide young people across different cultural backgrounds with
   gender-tailored opportunities to experiment with specific safer sex
   precautions in a nonthreatening virtual environment, free from unwanted
   parental control and peer monitoring.},

Abstract = {This paper, describes the design, development, and evaluation of The

   from traditional ``educational game{''} design strategies by mixing
   on-message content with nonfocal content, in an attempt to make the
   overall experience more approachable and engaging. One challenge of
   embedded design is that it targets attitudes and actions that are not
   always proximate to a particular behavior. Games with embedded content
   forgo explicit takeaways, and their possible distal effects present a
   challenge to traditional tests of efficacy. The benefit of embedded
   design, however, is that its holistic or ecological design approach
   (which considers feelings, emotions, affects, social relations, and
   connections to broader communities) stands in close alignment with the
   social-ecological model.},

Title = {Translating group programmes into online formats: establishing the
   acceptability of a parents' sex and relationships communication serious
   game},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {Background: With ongoing concerns about the sexual health and wellbeing
   of young people, there is increasing need to innovate intervention
   approaches. Engaging parents as agents to support their children,
   alongside capitalising on increasingly sophisticated technological
   options could jointly enhance support. Converting existing programmes
   into interactive game based options has the potential to broaden
   learning access whilst preserving behaviour change technique fidelity.
   However the acceptability of this approach and viability of adapting
   resources in this way is yet to be established. This paper reports on
   the process of converting an existing group programme ({''}What Should
   We Tell the Children?{''}) and tests the acceptability within a
   community setting.
   Methods: Translation of the original programme included selecting
   exercises and gathering user feedback on character and message framing
   preferences. For acceptability testing, parents were randomised to
   either the game (n = 106) or a control (non-interactive webpage)
   condition (n = 76). At time 1 all participants completed a survey on
   demographics, computer literacy and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)
   items. Post intervention (time 2) users repeated the TPB questions in
   addition to acceptability items. Interviews (n = 17) were conducted 3
   months post intervention to gather qualitative feedback on transfer of
   learning into real life.
   Results: The process of conversion identified clear preferences for
   first person role play, home setting and realistic characters alongside
   positively phrased feedback. Evaluation results show that the game was
   acceptable to parents on cognitive and emotional dimensions,
   particularly for parents of younger children. Acceptability was not
   influenced by baseline demographics, computer skills or baseline TPB
   variables. MANOVA analysis and qualitative feedback suggest potential
   for effective translation of learning into real life. However attrition
   was more likely in the game condition, potentially due to feedback text
   volume.
   Conclusions: A manualised group programme can be viably converted into a
   serious game format which is both cognitively and emotionally
   acceptable. The intervention may be more effectively targeted at parents
   with younger children, and further game developments must particularly
   address information dosing. Establishing the viability of digitally
   converting a group programme is a significant step forward for
   implementation focused research.},

Title = {Acceptance of a Smartphone-Based Visual Field Screening Platform for
   Glaucoma: Pre-Post Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Glaucoma, the silent thief of sight, is a major cause of
   blindness worldwide. It is a burden for people in low-income countries,
   specifically countries where glaucoma-induced blindness accounts for
   15\% of the total incidence of blindness. More than half the people
   living with glaucoma in low-income countries are unaware of the disease
   until it progresses to an advanced stage, resulting in permanent visual
   impairment.
   Objective: This study aims to evaluate the acceptability of the Glaucoma
   Easy Screener (GES), a low-cost and portable visual field screening
   platform comprising a smartphone, a stereoscopic virtual reality
   headset, and a gaming joystick.
   Methods: A mixed methods study that included 24 eye care professionals
   from 4 hospitals in Southwest Ethiopia was conducted to evaluate the
   acceptability of GES. A pre-post design was used to collect perspectives
   before and after using the GES by using questionnaires and
   semistructured interviews. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to
   determine the significance of any change in the scores of the
   questionnaire items (two-tailed, 95\% CI; a=.05). The questionnaire and
   interview questions were guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and
   Use of Technology.
   Results: Positive results were obtained both before and after use,
   suggesting the acceptance of mobile health solutions for conducting
   glaucoma screening by using a low-cost headset with a smartphone and a
   game controller. There was a significant increase (two-tailed, 95\% CI;
   a=.05) in the average scores of 86\% (19/22) of postuse questionnaire
   items compared with those of preuse questionnaire items. Ophthalmic
   professionals perceived GES as easy to use and as a tool that enabled
   the conduct of glaucoma screening tests, especially during outreach to
   rural areas. However, positive evaluations are contingent on the
   accuracy of the tool. Moreover, ophthalmologists voiced the need to
   limit the tool to screening only (ie, not for making diagnoses).
   Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility of using a mobile
   device in combination with a low-cost virtual reality headset and
   classic controller for glaucoma screening in rural areas. GES has the
   potential to reduce the burden of irreversible blindness caused by
   glaucoma. However, further assessment of its sensitivity and specificity
   is required.},

Title = {Using Distance Communication for the User-Centered Development of a
   Smartphone-Based Serious Game for Children With Type 1 Diabetes:
   Participatory Design Approach},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Background: The complications of type 1 diabetes (T1D) can be delayed or
   prevented in children with T1D who receive proper self-management
   education. Smartphone-based serious games are increasingly being used as
   an effective tool for teaching self-management. When developing a
   serious game, it is important that the development process be
   user-centered. Traditionally, different face-to-face methods have been
   used when children participate in the development process. However,
   face-to-face data collection is not always feasible. In such situations,
   distance communication can be used when developing a serious game.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a user-centered
   smartphone-based serious game that teaches self-management focused on
   carbohydrate intake in children aged 8-14 years with T1D using distance
   communication in both the development and evaluation of the game.
   Methods: The development and evaluation of a smartphone-based serious
   game prototype was inspired by the Lean principles, and a user-centered
   approach was applied. The development process included 1 expert
   interview and design workshops with children with T1D. On the basis of
   the interview and design workshop results, a serious game prototype was
   developed using Microsoft PowerPoint. The evaluation of the serious game
   prototype included an interview with a dietitian and a playtest with
   children with T1D. All data were collected using distance communication.
   Results: A user-centered smartphone-based serious game prototype was
   developed and evaluated. The expert interview with the dietitian formed
   the basis for the learning outcomes in the game. Four children and their
   parents contributed to the preferences, needs, requirements, and ideas
   for selected parts of the game design. The dietitian evaluated the
   prototype positively and validated its content and accuracy. The serious
   game prototype was well-received by the children and their parents
   during the playtest. The serious game prototype was perceived as a
   useful and engaging way to learn. However, the difficulty level was not
   appropriate, and the information was too basic for participants who had
   been diagnosed over a year ago. The use of digital communication
   platforms did not cause any problems.
   Conclusions: The smartphone-based serious game prototype has the
   potential to be a useful and attractive tool for teaching disease
   self-management. The use of distance communication proved to be a useful
   approach in the development of a serious game.},

Abstract = {Objective: As the most common chronic condition of childhood, asthma is
   a frequent target for family education. However, current educational
   strategies rarely tailor to learning style or literacy level. Thus, we
   developed and implemented a smartphone application (app) leveraging
   gamified features entitled CHANGE Asthma ({''}Clinic, Home, And on the
   Go Education for Asthma{''}). We subsequently assessed its impact on
   asthma control. Methods: Patients aged 4-11 years with a previously
   documented childhood asthma control test (C-ACT) score of <20,
   indicating poor control, were recruited to participate in this
   randomized control pilot study. The intervention group downloaded CHANGE
   Asthma; asthma control was assessed at enrollment and at follow-up. The
   changes in C-ACT score in both groups were compared using analysis of
   covariance (primary outcome). App usage was monitored for 4 months
   following download, and the relationship between usage time, and the
   change in C-ACT score was assessed via linear regression. Results: The
   control and intervention groups both included 20 caregivers with 75\% of
   participants completing follow-up. Although C-ACT scores among
   intervention participants significantly improved at follow-up, compared
   to their own baseline (P = 0.04), the change of C-ACT score did not
   significantly differ from that of the control group (P = 0.78). Among
   the intervention participants, there was a positive, dose-dependent
   relationship between app usage time and positive change in C-ACT score
   (P = 0.03). Conclusion: Usage of a gamified app was associated with a
   dose-dependent improvement in asthma control over time, suggesting that
   further evaluation of apps for asthma education, and perhaps for other
   chronic conditions, is warranted.},

Abstract = {Early behavioral markers for autism include differences in social
   attention and orienting in response to one's name when called, and
   differences in body movements and motor abilities. More efficient,
   scalable, objective, and reliable measures of these behaviors could
   improve early screening for autism. This study evaluated whether
   objective and quantitative measures of autism-related behaviors elicited
   from an app (SenseToKnow) administered on a smartphone or tablet and
   measured via computer vision analysis (CVA) are correlated with
   standardized caregiver-report and clinician administered measures of
   autism-related behaviors and cognitive, language, and motor abilities.
   This is an essential step in establishing the concurrent validity of a
   digital phenotyping approach. In a sample of 485 toddlers, 43 of whom
   were diagnosed with autism, we found that CVA-based gaze variables
   related to social attention were associated with the level of
   autism-related behaviors. Two language-related behaviors measured via
   the app, attention to people during a conversation and responding to
   one's name being called, were associated with children's language
   skills. Finally, performance during a bubble popping game was associated
   with fine motor skills. These findings provide initial support for the
   concurrent validity of the SenseToKnow app and its potential utility in
   identifying clinical profiles associated with autism. Future research is
   needed to determine whether the app can be used as an autism screening
   tool, can reliably stratify autism-related behaviors, and measure
   changes in autism-related behaviors over time.},

Title = {An Interactive Computer Game for Improving Selective Voluntary Motor
   Control in Children With Upper Motor Neuron Lesions: Development and
   Preliminary Feasibility Study},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Computer game-based interventions are emerging in pediatric
   neurorehabilitation, as they can provide two key elements for motor
   learning-motivating environments that enable long-term compliance, which
   is particularly relevant for children, and augmented feedback for
   improving movement performance. Objective: The overall aim of this study
   is to develop an interactive computer play for children with upper motor
   neuron lesions to train selective voluntary motor control and give
   particular attention to motivation and feedback. We also aim to
   determine features that make games engaging, investigate which sensory
   feedback modality is noticed the fastest during play, develop an
   interactive game, and evaluate its feasibility. Methods: We identified
   engaging game features by interviewing 19 children and adolescents
   undergoing rehabilitation. By using a test version of the game, we
   determined the response times of 10 patients who had to react to visual,
   auditory, or combined feedback signals. On the basis of the results of
   these two subprojects, we developed and designed a game environment.
   Feasibility was studied in terms of the practicability and acceptability
   of the intervention among 5 children with upper motor neuron lesions.
   Results: The game features deemed the most important by pediatric
   patients were strategic gameplay (13/29, 45\% of answers) and choice
   (6/29, 21\%). While playing the game, an acoustic alarm signal (reaction
   time: median 2.8 seconds) was detected significantly faster (P=.01) than
   conditions with other feedback modalities (avatar velocity reduction:
   median 7.8 seconds; color desaturation: median 5.7 seconds). Most
   children enjoyed playing the game, despite some technical issues.
   Conclusions: The careful identification of game features that increase
   motivation and feedback modalities that inform children quickly led to
   the development of an interactive computer play for training selective
   voluntary motor control in children and adolescents with upper motor
   neuron lesions.},

   violence},
Journal = {SEX EDUCATION-SEXUALITY SOCIETY AND LEARNING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {391-404},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper describes the development and evaluation of an interactive,
   narrative-based, multimedia game to promote learning and communication
   about sexual violence and health topics. High school-aged participants
   created the game concept in a three-week workshop, after which assets
   were assembled and refined by a university-based game design lab. The
   outcome, Lucidity, was a multimedia game with a nonlinear narrative that
   led to two different outcomes based on player decisions. The narrative
   followed the life of one character, an African American woman named
   Zaria who remembers and grapples with a sexual assault from her past.
   The player discovers parts of the story by reading comics, watching
   videos, navigating interactive websites and playing short videogames.
   The final evaluation consisted of gameplay, a post-game focus group and
   follow-up interviews. Twenty-four young people participated in three
   focus group discussions (n=9, n=5, n=10); 23 participated in the
   follow-up interviews. Salient themes identified in the focus group
   discussions included: overall approval of the game, the acquisition of
   new knowledge and minimal past exposure to conversations or education
   about sexual violence. At follow-up, almost all (n=22) had initiated a
   conversation about sexual violence with a parent, peer and/or teacher.
   Lucidity succeeded in engaging young people and facilitating
   communication with adults and peers regarding sexual violence and other
   sexual health topics. Ultimately, a game-based intervention such as this
   represents a feasible approach for introducing issues of sexual
   violence, with potential for future implementation in educational
   settings.},

Title = {Archetypes of Gamification: Analysis of mHealth Apps},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Background: Nowadays, numerous health-related mobile apps implement
   gamification in an attempt to draw on the motivational potential of
   video games and thereby increase user engagement or foster certain
   health behaviors. However, research on effective gamification is still
   in its infancy and researchers increasingly recognize methodological
   shortcomings of existing studies. What we actually know about the
   phenomenon today stems from fragmented pieces of knowledge, and a
   variety of different perspectives. Existing research primarily draws on
   conceptual knowledge that is gained from research prototypes, and
   isolated from industry best practices. We still lack knowledge on how
   gamification has been successfully designed and implemented within the
   industry and whether certain gamification approaches have shown to be
   particularly suitable for certain health behaviors.
   Objective: We address this lack of knowledge concerning best practices
   in the design and implementation of gamification for health-related
   mobile apps by identifying archetypes of gamification approaches that
   have emerged in pertinent health-related mobile apps and analyzing to
   what extent those gamification approaches are influenced by the
   underlying desired health-related outcomes.
   Methods: A 3-step research approach is employed. As a first step, a
   database of 143 pertinent gamified health-related mobile apps from the
   Apple App Store and Google Play Store is set up. Second, the
   gamification approach of each app within the database is classified
   based on an established taxonomy for gamification in health-related
   apps. Finally, a 2-step cluster analysis is conducted in order to
   identify archetypes of the most dominant gamification approaches in
   pertinent gamified health-related mobile apps.
   Results: Eight archetypes of gamification emerged from the analysis of
   health-related mobile apps: (1) competition and collaboration, (2)
   pursuing self-set goals without rewards, (3) episodical compliance
   tracking, (4) inherent gamification for external goals, (5) internal
   rewards for self-set goals, (6) continuous assistance through positive
   reinforcement, (7) positive and negative reinforcement without rewards,
   and (8) progressive gamification for health professionals. The results
   indicate a close relationship between the identified archetypes and the
   actual health behavior that is being targeted.
   Conclusions: By unveiling salient best practices and discussing their
   relationship to targeted health behaviors, this study contributes to a
   more profound understanding of gamification in mobile health. The
   results can serve as a foundation for future research that advances the
   knowledge on how gamification may positively influence health behavior
   change and guide practitioners in the design and development of highly
   motivating and effective health-related mobile health apps.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Air pollution had become a vital concern for the 2014 Youth Olympic
   Games in Nanjing. In order to control air pollutant emissions and ensure
   better air quality during the Games, the Nanjing municipal government
   took a series of aggressive control measures to reduce pollutant
   emissions in Nanjing and its surrounding cities during the Youth Olympic
   Games. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is an index of air quality which is
   used to inform the public about levels of air pollution and associated
   health risks. In this study, we use the AQI and air pollutant
   concentrations data to evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation
   of control measures. The results suggest that the emission reduction
   measures significantly improved air quality in Nanjing. In August 2014,
   the mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O-3 were 42.44
   mu g.m(-3), 59.01 mu g.m(-3), 11.12 mu g.m(-3), 31.09 mu g.m(-3), 0.76
   mg.m(-3) and 38.39 mu g.m(-3), respectively, and fell by 35.92\%,
   36.75\%, 20.40\%, 15.05\%, 8.54\% and 47.15\%, respectively, compared to
   the prophase mean before the emission reduction. After the emission
   reduction, the mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and O-3
   increased by 20.81\%, 41.84\%, 22.84\%, 21.16\% and 60.93\%,
   respectively, which is due to the cancellation of temporary atmospheric
   pollution control measures. The air pollutants diurnal variation curve
   during the emission reduction was lower than the other two periods,
   except for CO. In addition, the AQI of Nanjing and its surrounding
   cities showed a downward trend, compared with July 2014. The most of
   effective method to control air pollution is to implement the measures
   of regional cooperation and joint defense and control, and reduce local
   emissions during the polluted period, such as airborne dust,
   coal-burning, vehicle emissions, mobile sources and industrial
   production.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Exergaming, or technology-driven physical exercise, has gained
   popularity in recent years. Its applications include physical education,
   health promotion, and rehabilitation. Although studies have obtained
   promising results regarding the positive effects of exergaming, the
   outcomes of exergaming for different populations remain undetermined.
   Inconsistencies in the literature on this topic have multiple potential
   explanations, including the content and demand of the exergames and the
   capability of the exergamer. A model with a sound theoretical framework
   is required to facilitate matching between games and gamers. This
   article proposes a relational model based on a matrix of Bloom's
   taxonomy of learning domains and the performance components of
   exergames. Appropriate matching of the physical demands of an exergame
   and the ability of the exergamer would enhance the effective usage of
   exergaming for individuals with various needs. This theory-based
   exergame model is developed to promote the general development, physical
   status, and psychosocial well-being of students, older adults, and
   individuals with rehabilitation needs. This model may provide a resource
   for future research on the application, effectiveness, and design of
   exergaming.},

Title = {A Brief Mobile Evaluative Conditioning App to Reduce Body
   Dissatisfaction? A Pilot Study in University Women},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {Objective: Body dissatisfaction is a major risk factor underlying
   vulnerability to eating disorders. Experimental studies conducted in
   controlled environments suggest that body dissatisfaction could be
   improved by using evaluative conditioning (EC). The present study
   evaluates the feasibility of using an EC app in everyday life and the
   effects of its use on body dissatisfaction.Method: We designed a
   game-like app inspired by the Therapeutic EC app. 60 participants were
   randomly assigned to two conditions. Participants in the EC condition
   had to pair photographs of their own body with positive photographs,
   while participants in the neutral condition had to pair photographs of
   their own body with neutral photographs. We tested the effect of use of
   the app on body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, self-esteem,
   depressive symptoms and eating behaviors.Results: Analysis revealed that
   participants in all conditions presented a significant decrease in body
   dissatisfaction, drive for thinness and an increase in self-esteem.
   However, contrary to our hypothesis, these effects were no greater in
   the EC condition than in the neutral condition.Conclusion: This is the
   first study to evaluate the effects of an app-based EC intervention
   targeting body image. Results appear to be promising and the app could
   easily be implemented in an ecological setting as it is a low effort,
   attractive and accessible intervention. However, the findings question
   the idea that EC was responsible for the observed effects which could be
   explained by the exposure effect. Results are discussed.},

Title = {The Effectiveness of New Digital Technologies in Increasing Physical
   Activity Levels and Promoting Active and Healthy Ageing: A Narrative
   Review},
Journal = {HEALTH \& SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {Active healthy ageing (AHA) is a goal that several world organisations
   promote and is essential for modern societies where the average age is
   increasing. Physical activity (PA), including exercise, is a central
   aspect of achieving this goal, even though a high percentage of the
   population has high levels of sedentariness and low levels of PA.
   Therefore, this narrative review aimed to summarise and critically
   evaluate the existing literature that investigates technology-induced
   changes in PA levels and the possibility that these may produce active
   lifestyles, promoting AHA; this is unclear in the apparently healthy
   older adult population. Training protocols delivered via a website,
   similar to mobile applications, seem capable of increasing not only
   physical fitness but also PA levels, at least in the short term.
   Wearable active tracker devices (WATs), alone or together with websites,
   can lead to an increase in step count and average daily moderate PA in
   outdoor environments, as well as in specifically designed applications.
   Technology that can offer virtual physical games is an effective
   strategy to promote PA by overcoming certain barriers that may limit its
   practice in apparently healthy older adults. Currently, information and
   communication technologies (ICTs), and more generally new digital
   technologies, show great potential in increasing PA levels and reducing
   sedentary levels, at least in the short term. The heterogeneity of the
   proposed interventions and the frequent lack of follow-ups do not allow
   us to evaluate the effectiveness in the long term, which is crucial for
   the AHA process.},

Title = {Interactive Digital e-Health Game for Heart Failure Self-Management: A
   Feasibility Study},
Journal = {GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Pages = {366-374},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective: To develop and test the prototype of a serious digital game
   for improving community-dwelling older adults' heart failure (HF)
   knowledge and self-management behaviors. The serious game innovatively
   incorporates evidence-based HF guidelines with contemporary game
   technology. Materials and Methods: The study included three phases:
   development of the game prototype, its usability assessment, and
   evaluation of the game's functionality. Usability testing included
   researchers' usability assessment, followed by research personnel's
   observations of participants playing the game, and participants'
   completion of a usability survey. Next, in a pretest-post-test design,
   validated instrumentsthe Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test and the
   Self Care for Heart Failure Indexwere used to measure improvement in HF
   self-management knowledge and behaviors related to HF self-maintenance,
   self-management, and self-efficacy, respectively. A postgame survey
   assessed participants' perceptions of the game. Results: During
   usability testing, with seven participants, 100\%, 100\%, and 86\% found
   the game easy to play, enjoyable, and helpful for learning about HF,
   respectively. In the subsequent functionality testing, with 19
   participants, 89\% found the game interesting, enjoyable, and easy to
   play. Playing the game resulted in a significant improvement in HF
   self-management knowledge, a nonsignificant improvement in self-reported
   behaviors related to HF self-maintenance, and no difference in HF
   self-efficacy scores. Participants with lower education level and age
   preferred games to any other medium for receiving information.
   Conclusion: It is feasible to develop a serious digital game that
   community-dwelling older adults with HF find both satisfying and
   acceptable and that can improve their self-management knowledge.},

Title = {Exploring an Artificial Intelligence-Based, Gamified Phone App Prototype
   to Track and Improve Food Choices of Adolescent Girls in Vietnam:
   Acceptability, Usability, and Likeability Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Adolescents' consumption of healthy foods is suboptimal in
   low- and middle-income countries. Adolescents' fondness for games and
   social media and the increasing access to smartphones make apps suitable
   for collecting dietary data and influencing their food choices. Little
   is known about how adolescents use phones to track and shape their food
   choices.
   Objective: This study aimed to examine the acceptability, usability, and
   likability of a mobile phone app prototype developed to collect dietary
   data using artificial intelligence-based image recognition of foods,
   provide feedback, and motivate users to make healthier food choices. The
   findings were used to improve the design of the app.
   Methods: A total of 4 focus group discussions (n=32 girls, aged 15-17
   years) were conducted in Vietnam. Qualitative data were collected and
   analyzed by grouping ideas into common themes based on content analysis
   and ground theory.
   Results: Adolescents accepted most of the individual- and team-based
   dietary goals presented in the app prototype to help them make healthier
   food choices. They deemed the overall app wireframes, interface, and
   graphic design as acceptable, likable, and usable but suggested the
   following modifications: tailored feedback based on users'medical
   history, anthropometric characteristics, and fitness goals; new language
   on dietary goals; provision of information about each of the food group
   dietary goals; wider camera frame to fit the whole family food tray, as
   meals are shared in Vietnam; possibility of digitally separating food
   consumption on shared meals; and more appealing graphic design,
   including unique badge designs for each food group. Participants also
   liked the app's feedback on food choices in the form of badges,
   notifications, and statistics. A new version of the app was designed
   incorporating adolescent's feedback to improve its acceptability,
   usability, and likability.
   Conclusions: A phone app prototype designed to track food choice and
   help adolescent girls from low- and middle-income countries make
   healthier food choices was found to be acceptable, likable, and usable.
   Further research is needed to examine the feasibility of using this
   technology at scale.},

Title = {Serious games for smoking prevention and cessation: A systematic review
   of game elements and game effects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {818-833},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective: Serious health games might have the potential to prevent
   tobacco smoking and its health consequences, depending on the inclusion
   of specific game elements. This review aimed to assess the composition
   of serious games and their effects on smoking initiation prevention and
   cessation and behavioral determinants.
   Materials and Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase,
   PsycINFO, and Web of Science for publications that evaluated serious
   games aimed at changing smoking behavior or behavioral determinants. A
   taxonomy by King et al was used to classify game elements.
   Results: We identified 15 studies, evaluating 14 unique serious games.
   All games combined multiple game elements (mean 5.5; range, 3-10). Most
   frequently used were general and intermittent rewards, theme and genre
   features, and punishments. Six studies on smoking prevention together
   assessed 20 determinants and found statistically significant positive
   effects for 8 determinants (eg, attitude, knowledge, intention). Of 7
   studies on smoking cessation, 5 found positive, statistically
   significant effects on smoking cessation or status. These studies found
   statistically significant positive effects for 6 of 12 determinants (eg,
   self-efficacy, attitude, intention). The majority of included studies
   had poor or fair methodological quality, lacked follow-up measures, and
   had fixed (as opposed to free, on-demand) play sessions.
   Conclusions: Serious games included multiple types of game elements. The
   evidence from a number of studies suggests that games may have positive
   effects on smoking-related outcomes, particularly smoking cessation.
   However, as most studies had important methodological limitations,
   stronger designs are needed to demonstrate, quantify, and understand the
   effects of serious games.},

Title = {The Effectiveness of the Foodbot Factory Mobile Serious Game on
   Increasing Nutrition Knowledge in Children},
Journal = {NUTRIENTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The interactive and engaging nature of serious games (i.e., video games
   designed for educational purposes) enables deeper learning and
   facilitates behavior change; however, most do not specifically support
   the dissemination of national dietary guidelines, and there are limited
   data on their impact on child nutrition knowledge. The Foodbot Factory
   serious game mobile application was developed to support school children
   in learning about Canada's Food Guide; however, its impacts on nutrition
   knowledge have not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to
   determine if Foodbot Factory effectively improves children's knowledge
   of Canada's Food Guide, compared to a control group (control app). This
   study was a single-blinded, parallel, randomized controlled pilot study
   conducted among children ages 8-10 years attending Ontario Tech
   University day camps. Compared to the control group (n = 34), children
   who used Foodbot Factory (n = 39) had significant increases in overall
   nutrition knowledge (10.3 +/- 2.9 to 13.5 +/- 3.8 versus 10.2 +/- 3.1 to
   10.4 +/- 3.2, p < 0.001), and in Vegetables and Fruits (p < 0.001),
   Protein Foods (p < 0.001), and Whole Grain Foods (p = 0.040) sub-scores.
   No significant difference in knowledge was observed in the Drinks
   sub-score. Foodbot Factory has the potential to be an effective
   educational tool to support children in learning about nutrition.},

Abstract = {Background. Asthma continues to be a substantial cause of morbidity in
   pediatric populations. New strategies are needed to provide
   cost-effective educational interventions for children with asthma,
   particularly those in the inner city.
   Objective. To assess the effectiveness of a multimedia educational
   software program about asthma.
   Setting. A hospital-based primary care clinic and an affiliated
   neighborhood health center.
   Design. Randomized, controlled trial.
   Population. Children 3 to 12 years old with physician-diagnosed asthma.
   Intervention. An interactive educational computer program, Asthma
   Control, designed to teach children about asthma and its management.
   Using a graphic display of a child going through simulated daily events,
   the game emphasizes: 1) monitoring; 2) allergen identification; 3) use
   of medications; 4) use of health services; and 5) maintenance of normal
   activity. Control group participants reviewed printed educational
   materials with a research assistant.
   Outcomes. Acute health care use (emergency department and outpatient)
   was the primary outcome. Secondary outcome measures included maternal
   report of asthma symptom severity, child functional status and school
   absences, satisfaction with care, and parental and child knowledge of
   asthma.
   Results. A total of 137 families were enrolled in the study (76
   intervention, 61 control). Both intervention and control groups showed
   substantial improvement in all outcomes during the 12-month follow-up
   period. Aside from improvement in knowledge after use of the computer
   program, no differences were demonstrated between the 2 groups in
   primary or secondary outcome measures. Children reported enjoyment of
   program use.
   Conclusions. This trial of an educational software program found that it
   did not produce greater improvement than occurred with review of
   traditional written materials. Because both groups showed substantial
   improvement over baseline, computer-based education may be more
   cost-effective. Alternatively, improvements in illness severity over
   time may overshadow the effects of such interventions.
   Rigorous comprehensive evaluations such as this are necessary to assess
   new interventions intended to improve management and outcomes of asthma.},

Title = {The Role of Engagement in Teleneurorehabilitation: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {The growing understanding of the importance of involving patients with
   neurological diseases in their healthcare routine either for at-home
   management of their chronic conditions or after the hospitalization
   period has opened the research for new rehabilitation strategies to
   enhance patient engagement in neurorehabilitation. In addition, the use
   of new digital technologies in the neurorehabilitation field enables the
   implementation of telerehabilitation systems such as virtual reality
   interventions, video games, web-based interventions, mobile
   applications, web-based or telephonic telecoach programs, in order to
   facilitate the relationship between clinicians and patients, and to
   motivate and activate patients to continue with the rehabilitation
   process at home. Here we present a systematic review that aims at
   reviewing the effectiveness of different engagement strategies and the
   different engagement assessments while using telerehabilitation systems
   in patients with neurological disorders. We used PICO's format to define
   the question of the review, and the systematic review protocol was
   designed following the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews
   and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Bibliographical data was
   collected by using the following bibliographic databases: PubMed,
   EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eighteen studies were included in
   this systematic review for full-text analyses. Overall, the reviewed
   studies using engagement strategies through telerehabilitation systems
   in patients with neurological disorders were mainly focused on patient
   self-management and self-awareness, patient motivation, and patient
   adherence subcomponents of engagement, that are involved in by the
   behavioral, cognitive, and emotional dimensions of engagement.
   Conclusion: The studies commented throughout this systematic review pave
   the way for the design of new telerehabilitation protocols, not only
   focusing on measuring quantitative or qualitative measures but measuring
   both of them through a mixed model intervention design (1). The future
   clinical studies with a mixed model design will provide more abundant
   data regarding the role of engagement in telerehabilitation, leading to
   a possibly greater understanding of its underlying components.},

Journal = {GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Pages = {312-320},

Abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually
   transmitted disease, with the highest infection rates among those
   sexually active under 25. Although vaccination can reduce HPV cancers
   among men, public health interventions have primarily targeted females.
   Increased gaming rates among men provide innovative opportunities to
   motivate behavior change. This study sought to explore which game
   development and design strategies are most effective in a game for
   sexual health, specifically focused on HPV. We also sought to capture
   information relevant to preferred gaming platforms and game mechanics
   (health messages, avatars, and visual imagery).Materials and Methods:
   Twenty-two (n = 22) qualitative interviews were conducted with experts.
   Using grounded theory, interview data was coded, and emergent themes
   were identified.Results: Game mechanics most mentioned included
   simulation/role-playing, social interaction, narrative, and rewards.
   Experts felt it was important to keep the game in the context of the
   target audience and integrate the game into an existing game/game
   scenario or application. Experts also felt the game should link to
   external resources and enlist partnerships or collaborations with
   external health agencies. Moreover, while there are benefits to each
   gaming platform, games on mobile phones and tablets are most
   appropriate.Conclusion: Digital games are a nonconfrontational approach
   to discussing HPV and can increase knowledge/awareness and positively
   influence behavior change toward vaccine uptake. Digital games present a
   safe environment for role-playing through simulated activities without
   real-world consequences.},

Abstract = {Smartphone use by young Spanish students has been broadly explored,
   specifically among university, high school, and primary school students.
   The goal of this article is to analyze smartphone use, its gender
   differences, and its relationship with Internet gaming disorder and
   Internet gambling disorder in vocational education and training (VET)
   students. A retrospective ex post facto study was carried out in which
   habitual uses of the mobile phone, experiences related to it, Internet
   gaming disorder, and online pathological gambling were evaluated. The
   sample consisted of 1,107 VET students (55.1\% male) with a mean age of
   18.8 years. Problematic smartphone use was observed in 7.9\% of the
   sample and 28.6\% used it with occasional problems. Gender differences
   were obtained, with a higher presence of problematic use among females.
   According to the regression analysis, the variables that best
   differentiated participants who presented problematic smartphone use
   were using it in class, being female, and being a user of movies and
   videogames. Between videogames and gambling users, the variable that
   best differentiated participants who presented problematic smartphone
   use was videogame use. Although the prevalence of frequent problems with
   smartphone use is relatively low, the percentage of students at risk
   must not be disregarded by the educational community. It is recommended
   to promote the appropriate use of technologies in VET students. The
   gender differences found in this study should be addressed with special
   consideration.},

Journal = {TRIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Background: Syphilis has recently resurfaced as a significant public
   health problem. Since the 2000s, isolated syphilis outbreaks have
   increasingly occurred in North America, Europe, and Australia; in
   Brazil, there have been progressive increases in both congenital and
   acquired syphilis. There are several possible explanations, such as
   misdiagnosis of acquired syphilis, which could increase the number of
   untreated transmitters in the population; failure to initiate or
   complete treatment; and nontreatment of sexual partners (leading to
   reinfection). Mobile technologies have been successfully used to promote
   behavior changes and can positively impact treatment and follow-up
   adherence in patients with infectious diseases. The purpose of this
   clinical trial is to evaluate treatment and monitoring methods in
   patients with syphilis, including follow-up by telephone, via a game in
   a smartphone app, and at public health centers.
   Methods: The SIM study is a single-center, randomized controlled trial
   with a 12-month follow-up period. The aim is to identify the most
   effective method of follow-up regarding patient compliance with
   treatment. The tests will be performed in a mobile unit in easily
   accessible locations. The goal is to perform 10,000 rapid tests for
   syphilis. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis according to VDRL tests
   will be randomized to one of three arms: telephone, smartphone game, or
   conventional in-person follow-up. All analyses will follow the
   intention-to-treat principle.
   Conclusion: If we find differences in effectiveness, a major change in
   the conventional approach for this patient population may be needed,
   potentially affecting current Brazilian health policy strategies.},

Abstract = {Serious games are video games that are intended to support learning
   while entertaining. They are considered valuable tools to improve
   user-specific skills or facilitate educational or therapeutic processes,
   especially in children. One of the disadvantages of computer games, in
   general, is their promotion of sedentary habits, considered as a
   significant risk factor for developing diseases such as obesity and
   hypertension. Exergames are serious games created to overcome the
   disadvantages of traditional computer games by promoting physical
   activity while playing. This study describes the development and
   evaluation of an adaptive component to monitor physical activity in
   children while using an exergame. The system is based on wearable
   technology to measure heart rate and perform real-time customizations in
   the exergame. To evaluate the adaptive component, an experiment was
   conducted with 30 children between 5 and 7 years of age, where the
   adaptive system was contrasted with a conventional interactive system
   (an exergame without adaptive component). It was demonstrated that the
   computer game, using the adaptive component, was able to change in
   real-time some of its functionalities based on the user characteristics.
   Increased levels of heart rate and caloric expenditure were significant
   in some of the game scenarios using the adaptive component. Although a
   formal user experience evaluation was not performed, excellent game
   playability and adherence by users were observed.},

Abstract = {Background Interprofessional practice (IPP) has been shown to contribute
   to quality service provision and improved health outcomes. This
   knowledge has led to the integration of interprofessional education into
   course curricula for many health-care disciplines. Offering
   interprofessional education in rural areas to students undertaking work
   integrated learning placements is challenging particularly because of
   the diversity of students and placement dates combined with the student
   focus on the assessable placement curriculum. This research investigated
   and evaluated the utility of an escape room as an educational modality
   that facilitates learning whilst providing a supportive and motivating
   learning environment. Our project focused on the acquisition of
   interprofessional practice knowledge and experience by a health
   professional student cohort. Methods This study used the novel
   intervention of an escape room combined with an interactive teaching
   session to test student engagement and learning about interprofessional
   practice and teamwork. The research used a mixed methods single group
   pre-post design. Results Fifty students (78\% female) from seventeen
   universities and seven professions participated in teams of three to six
   members. Most participants (66\%) had not previously completed an escape
   room. The results showed that the intervention provided effective and
   engaging learning and was intrinsically appealing to students despite
   its non-assessable nature. Individual student reflection on their
   participation showed developing insight into the critical importance of
   clear communication and intentional team member collaboration in the
   provision of effective interprofessional practice. Conclusions The
   escape room intervention added value to the placement curriculum and
   proved flexible for a heterogeneous student cohort.},

Title = {Perceived effectiveness of an innovative mobile-based serious game on
   the improvement of soft skills in minimally invasive surgical training},

Abstract = {Introduction: Soft skills have a pertinent role for the quality and
   efficient outcomes in minimally invasive surgical procedures that are
   difficult to practice due to time constraints, limited resources, and
   other logistical reasons. The literature says that serious games serve
   as better resources for learning soft skills but needs evaluation from
   stakeholders. This study explores the perceived effectiveness of serious
   gaming intervention as a learning tool to improve communication,
   collaborative skills among the residents in surgery, house officers and
   junior doctors.
   Method: A total of nine participants volunteered to take part in the
   exploratory study. During the study, the participants responded to a
   pretest quiz, followed by exploration of the game and a post-test quiz.
   The perceived perceptions on the effectiveness of the gaming
   intervention were collected on a five-point Likert scale questionnaire
   with open-ended questions.
   Results: There was no significant difference in pre-test and post-test
   scores on communication and collaborative skills. Among the three
   themes, there was significant effect of usefulness of the application of
   improvement of soft skills (90\% response); however, technicalities
   should be addressed (50\% of responses). The qualitative feedback
   renders that, better graphics, tutorial run, user-friendly interface and
   controls, and enhanced 3D environment would enhance the efficacy of the
   prototype.
   Conclusion: An innovative mobile-based serious gaming intervention was
   developed and tested for its effectiveness as a resource to develop soft
   skills among surgeons in training. The results indicate that gamified
   interventions can serve as educational resources and supplement the
   self-directed learning in surgical education.},

Title = {Physical Exercise Program on Fall Prevention Using Technological
   Interface: Pretest Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Prevention of falls among older adults has boosted the
   development of technological solutions, requiring testing in clinical
   contexts and robust studies that need prior validation of procedures and
   data collection tools.
   Objective: The objectives of our study were to test the data collection
   procedure, train the team, and test the usability of the FallSensing
   Games app by older adults in a community setting.
   Methods: This study was conducted as a pretest of a future pilot study.
   Older adults were recruited in a day care center, and several tests were
   applied. Physical exercise sessions were held using the interactive
   FallSensing Games app. Nurse training strategies was completed.
   Results: A total of 11 older adults participated. The mean age was 75.08
   (SD 3.80) years, mostly female (10/11, 91\%) and with low (3-6 years)
   schooling (10/11, 91\%). Clinically, the results show a group of older
   adults with comorbidities. Cognitive evaluation of the participants
   through the Mini Mental State Examination showed results with an average
   score of 25.64 (SD 3.5). Functional capacity assessed using the Lawton
   Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (overall score from 0-23,
   with lower scores reflecting worse capacity to perform activities)
   showed impairment in different instrumental activities of daily living
   (average score 14.27). The data collection tool proved to enable easy
   interpretation; however, its structure needed small adjustments to
   facilitate the data collection process. Despite the length of the
   questionnaire, its implementation took an average of 21 minutes. For the
   assessment of the prevalence of fear of falling, the need to add a
   question was identified. The performance of functional tests under the
   guidance and presence of rehabilitation nurses ensured the safety of the
   participants. The interactive games were well accepted by the
   participants, and the physical exercises allowed data collection on the
   functionality of the older adults, such as the number of repetitions in
   the tests, range of movement (angle), duration of the movements, and
   execution of each cycle. Concerning the training of the nurses, it was
   crucial that they had experience with the platform, specifically the
   position of the chair facing the platform, the position of the feet, the
   posture of participants, and the use of sensors.
   Conclusions: In the future pilot study, the researchers point out the
   need to design a study with mixed methods (quantitative and
   qualitative), thus enriching the study results.},

Abstract = {The interactive education tool ``DM Wonder Trip{''} is a combination of
   the board games, Monopoly and Snakes and Ladders. It is designed for
   type 1 diabetes patients (T1D) and their families to enhance their
   knowledge and self-management skills toward improving self-care and
   preventing acute complications. We developed DM Wonder Trip, and
   evaluated its entertainment value, usability, and clinical usefulness.
   The 107 study participants comprised 53 T1D patients (aged 8.2-25 years;
   the game players), 44 caregivers (the observers), and 10 physicians (the
   game leaders). DM Wonder Trip is a board game that uses cards to educate
   participants about diabetes, especially the self-care-skills,
   problem-solving, and daily-decision making aspects. After playing the
   game for 30 minutes, all participants completed questionnaires. Among
   the 3 groups of participants (patients, observers and physicians), the
   evaluation scores recorded for entertainment were 60\%, 74\% and 70\%,
   respectively; for usability, 84\%, 91 \% and 60\%; and for clinical
   usefulness, 83\%, 93\% and 100\%. All 3 groups of participants awarded
   the highest scores to the clinical-usefulness category. There were no
   statistically significant differences among the variables and groups. We
   modified the game based on the participants' evaluations and comments.
   In conclusion, the DM Wonder Trip educational tool can be used as part
   of diabetes self-management education; to confirm diabetes knowledge and
   self-management skills before hospital discharge; or to promote better
   relationships between health-care providers, patients, and families.},

Title = {Freemium Mobile Gaming: Exploring the Missing Link between Playing a
   ``Free{''} Mobile Game and Paying for its Premium Version},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 11},
Abstract = {Design/methodology/approach: A primary quantitative study was conducted
   using a structured questionnaire. To test our hypotheses across
   different cultures and increase the generalizability of our findings, we
   surveyed potential users of freemium mobile games in the UK and
   Singapore. Our final sample consisted of 295 users. Purpose: While a lot
   of research focus has been placed on mobile games, studies on the
   factors influencing the adoption of this form of entertainment do not
   distinguish between pay-to-play and freemium games. We argue that the
   freemium model, where the user downloads a stripped-down version of a
   game for free and pays for updates, requires distinct focus. Our
   research aims are to: a) explore the factors determining the adoption of
   freemium mobile gaming as a form of entertainment and b) identify the
   conditions under which the gap between intending to play freemium mobile
   games and making in-game purchases is created. Findings: Our study's
   contribution to current research is twofold. Firstly, its findings
   reveal the factors determining the adoption of freemium mobile games
   using TAM. Secondly, our findings indicate the additional factors that
   bridge the gap between intention to play and intention to pay, namely
   loyalty with playing mobile games and perceived economic value.
   Originality/value: To our knowledge this is the first study exploring
   the factors determining the adoption of freemium mobile gaming as a form
   of entertainment and identify the conditions under which the gap between
   intending to play freemium mobile games and making in-game purchases is
   created.},

Abstract = {In India, gender inequalities have deleterious effects on reproductive
   health outcomes among women and girls. This study used an interactive
   storytelling game as a qualitative data collection approach to learn
   about adolescents' experiences and societal norms regarding gender.
   Eight sessions were conducted with a total of 30 girls and 10 boys (ages
   15-17). Participants created characters, themes, and locations for the
   stories and shared experiences about gender through their characters.
   Sessions were recorded, transcribed, translated, and analysed for
   emergent themes. Themes included: interest in and prevalence of romantic
   relationships among adolescents, stigma associated with adolescent
   relationships and its influence on individual norms, and girls'
   experiences of harassment. Findings suggest that the use of a
   qualitative storytelling game is one way to understand the experiences
   of adolescents around sensitive issues such as gender. They also suggest
   a need for interventions focused on improving gender attitudes among
   adolescents, fostering parent-child communication, and strengthening the
   policy response to girls' harassment.},

Title = {Epic Allies, a Gamified Mobile Phone App to Improve Engagement in Care,
   Antiretroviral Uptake, and Adherence Among Young Men Who Have Sex With
   Men and Young Transgender Women Who Have Sex With Men: Protocol for a
   Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: In the United States, young men who have sex with men (YMSM)
   and transgender women who have sex with men (YTWSM) bear a
   disproportionate burden of prevalent and incident HIV infections. Once
   diagnosed, many YMSM and YTWSM struggle to engage in HIV care, adhere to
   antiretroviral therapy (ART), and achieve viral suppression.
   Computer-based interventions, including those focused on behavior
   change, are recognized as effective tools for engaging youth.
   Objective: The purpose of the study described in this protocol is to
   evaluate the efficacy of Epic Allies, a theory-based mobile phone app
   that utilizes game mechanics and social networking features to improve
   engagement in HIV care, ART uptake, ART adherence, and viral suppression
   among HIV-positive YMSM and YTWSM. The study also qualitatively assesses
   intervention acceptability, perceived impact, and sustainability.
   Methods: This is a two-group, active-control randomized controlled trial
   of the Epic Allies app. YMSM and YTWSM aged 16 to 24 inclusive, with
   detectable HIV viral load are randomized 1:1 within strata of new to
   care (newly entered HIV medical care <12 months of baseline visit) or
   ART-nonadherent (first entered HIV medical care >12 months before
   baseline visit) to intervention or control conditions. The intervention
   condition addresses ART adherence barriers through medication reminders
   and adherence monitoring, tracking of select adherence-related behaviors
   (eg, alcohol and marijuana use), an interactive dashboard that displays
   the participant's adherence-related behaviors and provides tailored
   feedback, encouragement messages from other users, daily HIV/ART
   educational articles, and gamification features (eg, mini-games, points,
   badges) to increase motivation for behavior change and app engagement.
   The control condition features weekly phone-based notifications to
   encourage participants to view educational information in the control
   app. Follow-up assessments are administered at 13, 26, and 39 weeks for
   each arm. The primary outcome measure is viral suppression. Secondary
   outcome measures include engagement in care, ART uptake, ART adherence,
   and psychosocial barriers to engagement in care and ART adherence,
   including psychological distress, stigma, and social support.
   Results: Baseline enrollment began in September 2015 and was completed
   in September 2016 (n=146), and assessment of intervention outcomes
   continued through August 2017. Results for primary and secondary outcome
   measures are expected to be reported in ClinicalTrials.gov by April 30,
   2018.
   Conclusions: If successful, Epic Allies will represent a novel adherence
   intervention for a group disproportionately impacted by HIV in the
   United States. Adherent patients would require less frequent clinic
   visits and experience fewer HIV-related secondary infections, thereby
   reducing health care costs and HIV transmission. Epic Allies could
   easily be expanded and adopted for use among larger populations of YMSM
   and YTWSM, other HIV-positive populations, and for those diagnosed with
   other chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.},

Abstract = {The design and development research, first proposed by Brown and Collins
   in the 1990s, is currently among the well-known methods in educational
   research to test theory and validate its practicality. The method is
   also known as developmental research, design research, design-based
   research, formative research and design-cased and possesses conceptual
   underpinning and practical aspects of the `what' and `how' of `doing'.
   This paper describes the design and development of a web-based Arabic
   vocabulary learning games prototype incorporating the methods and
   approaches of DDR for elementary learners in Centre for Foundation
   Studies (CFS), International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). The
   effort in generating this learning prototype attempts to design, develop
   and integrate a game-based learning application in an online platform.
   It is meant to provide an interactive learning experience for learners
   who have been through traditional non-computer based Arabic teaching and
   learning methods. Their feedbacks and responses are then gathered and
   analysed as the formative evaluation for the design and development
   principles. The exploration of the potential of use for the game-based
   learning prototype in teaching and learning in real setting by various
   experts, learners and teachers was also among the steps taken to
   evaluate the usability and practicality of the prototype during the

Abstract = {Background: Cognitive training can improve cognition in healthy older
   adults.
   Objective: The objectives are to evaluate the implementation of
   community-based computerized cognitive training (CCT) and its
   effectiveness on cognition, gait, and balance in healthy older adults.
   Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial with baseline and
   follow-up assessments was conducted at two community centers in
   Singapore. Healthy community-dwelling adults aged 55 years and older
   participated in a 10-week CCT program with 2-hour instructor-led group
   classes twice a week. Participants used a mobile app to play games
   targeting attention, memory, decision making, visuospatial abilities,
   and cognitive flexibility. Implementation was assessed at the
   participant, provider, and community level (eg, reach, implementation,
   and facilitators and barriers). Effectiveness measures were the
   Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status
   (RBANS), Color Trails Test 2 (CTT-2), Berg Balance Scale, and GAITRite
   walkway measures (single and dual task gait speed, dual task cost, and
   single and dual task gait variability index {[}GVI]).
   Results: A total of 94 healthy community-dwelling adults participated in
   the CCT program (mean age 68.8 {[}SD 6.3] years). Implementation
   measures revealed high reach (125/155, 80.6\%) and moderate adherence
   but poor penetration of sedentary older adults (43/125, 34.4\%). The
   effectiveness data were based on intention-to-treat (ITT) and
   per-protocol (PP) analysis. In the ITT analysis, single task GVI
   increased (b=2.32, P=.02, 95\% CI {[}0.30 to 4.35]) and RBANS list
   recognition subtest deteriorated (b =-0.57, P=.01, 95\% CI {[}-1.00 to
   -0.141) in both groups. In the PP analysis, time taken to complete CTT-2
   (b =-13.5, P=.01, 95\% CI {[}-23.95 to -3.14]; Cohen d effect size =
   0.285) was faster in the intervention group. Single task gait speed was
   not statistically significantly maintained in the intervention group
   (b=5.38, P=.06, 95\% CI {[}-0.30 to 11.36]) and declined in the control
   group (Cohen d effect size = 0.414). PP analyses also showed interaction
   terms for RBANS list recall subtest (b=-0.36, P=.08, 95\% CI {[}-0.75 to
   0.041) and visuospatial domain (b=0.46, P=.08, 95\% CI {[}-0.05 to
   0.961) that were not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: CCT can be implemented in community settings to improve
   attention and executive function among healthy older adults. Findings
   help to identify suitable healthy aging programs that can be implemented
   on a larger scale within communities.},

Title = {Validation of a Portable Game Controller to Assess Peak Expiratory Flow
   Against Conventional Spirometry in Children: Cross-sectional Study},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Background: International asthma guidelines recommend the monitoring of
   peak expiratory flow (PEF) as part of asthma self-management in children
   and adolescents who poorly perceive airflow obstruction, those with a
   history of severe exacerbations, or those who have difficulty
   controlling asthma Measured with a peak flow meter, PEF represents a
   person's maximum speed of expiration and helps individuals to follow
   their disease evolution and, ultimately, to prevent asthma
   exacerbations. However, patient adherence to regular peak flow meter use
   is poor, particularly in pediatric populations. To address this, we
   developed an interactive tablet-based game with a portable game
   controller that can transduce a signal from the user's breath to
   generate a PEF value.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the concordance
   between PEF values obtained with the game controller and various
   measures derived from conventional pulmonary function tests (ie,
   spirometry) and to synthesize the participants' feedback.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional multicenter study, 158 children (aged
   8-15 years old) with a diagnosis or suspicion of asthma performed
   spirometry and played the game in one of two hospital university
   centers. We evaluated the correlation between PEF measured by both the
   game controller and spirometry, forced expiratory volume at 1 second
   (FEV1), and forced expiratory flow at 25\%-75\% of pulmonary volume
   (FEF25-75), using Spearman correlation. A Bland-Altman plot was
   generated for comparison of PEF measured by the game controller against
   PEF measured by spirometry. A post-game user feedback questionnaire was
   administered and analyzed.
   Results: The participants had a mean age of 10.9 (SD 2.5) years, 44\%
   (71/158) were female, and 88\% (139/158) were White. On average, the
   pulmonary function of the participants was normal, including FEV1, PEF,
   and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC). The PEF measured by the game
   controller was reproducible in 96.2\% (152/158) of participants
   according to standardized criteria. The PEF measured by the game
   controller presented a good correlation with PEF measured by spirometry
   (r=0.83, P <.001), with FEV1 (r=0.74, P<.001), and with FEF25-75
   (r=0.65, P<.001). The PEF measured by the game controller presented an
   expected mean bias of -36.4 L/min as compared to PEF measured by
   spirometry. The participants' feedback was strongly positive, with
   78.3\% (123/157) reporting they would use the game if they had it at
   home.
   Conclusions: The game controller we developed is an interactive tool
   appreciated by children with asthma, and the PEF values measured by the
   game controller are reproducible, with a good correlation to values
   measured by conventional spirometry. Future studies are necessary to
   evaluate the clinical impact this novel tool might have on asthma
   management and its potential use in an out-of-hospital setting.},

Title = {Development of the Interactive Rehabilitation Game System for Children
   with Autism Based on Game Psychology},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {Autism is a widespread neurodevelopmental disorder. The cause of autism
   is still unclear. Once it occurs, it will be accompanied for life.
   Intervention treatment is currently recognized as an effective method.
   With the rise of somatosensory technology, Kinect has gradually been
   applied to the field of autism rehabilitation with its natural
   human-computer interaction and game rehabilitation psychology. Because
   there is a great demand for autism rehabilitation training resources in
   China and the existing somatosensory rehabilitation equipment has some
   shortcomings, this study designed a set of somatosensory rehabilitation
   system for autistic children based on Kinect and carried out its
   rehabilitation effect with experimental demonstration. The specific
   research work mainly includes the following contents: first, aiming at
   the rehabilitation needs of children with autism, this article combines
   mainstream intervention treatment methods, using C\# programming
   language and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) development
   technology to develop Kinect-based somatosensory game modules. The
   somatosensory rehabilitation game involves the training of the language
   communication, behavioral movement, daily life, sensory integration, and
   other comprehensive abilities of children with autism, which improves
   the shortcomings of the previous rehabilitation training in the scope of
   intervention. A variety of game types and diversified game modes are
   designed to meet the individual needs of rehabilitation training for
   children with autism. Second, experiments were carried out to verify the
   rehabilitation effect of the system. Using the Childhood Autism Rating
   Scale (CARS) and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI)
   scale as the rehabilitation effect evaluation tools of this system, the
   experimental subjects were divided into the experimental group and
   control group, and different comparative experiments were conducted,
   respectively. Through the analysis of the scoring data of the CARS, it
   is found that the comprehensive ability of the experimental group of
   children receiving somatosensory rehabilitation training is
   significantly improved. Through the analysis of the scoring data of the
   PEDI scale, it is found that the children's language communication,
   behavioral activities, and daily life abilities of the experimental
   group have been significantly enhanced. This article focuses on the
   design of the somatosensory game module of the autistic somatosensory
   rehabilitation system and the analysis of the system's rehabilitation
   effect. It satisfies the training and rehabilitation needs of children
   with autism and has strong practical significance.},

Title = {Virtual Reality for Screening of Cognitive Function in Older Persons:
   Comparative Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Background: The prevalence of dementia, which presents as cognitive
   decline in one or more cognitive domains affecting function, is
   increasing worldwide. Traditional cognitive screening tools for dementia
   have their limitations, with emphasis on memory and, to a lesser extent,
   on the cognitive domain of executive function. The use of virtual
   reality (VR) in screening for cognitive function in older persons is
   promising, but evidence for its use is sparse.
   Objective: The primary aim was to examine the feasibility and
   acceptability of using VR to screen for cognitive impairment in older
   persons in a primary care setting. The secondary aim was to assess the
   module's ability to discriminate between cognitively intact and
   cognitively impaired participants.
   Methods: A comparative study was conducted at a public primary care
   clinic in Singapore, where persons aged 65-85 years were recruited based
   on a cut-off score of 26 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
   scale. They participated in a VR module for assessment of their learning
   and memory, perceptual-motor function, and executive function. Each
   participant was evaluated by the total performance score (range: 0-700)
   upon completion of the study. A questionnaire was also administered to
   assess their perception of and attitude toward VR.
   Results: A total of 37 participants in Group 1 (cognitively intact; MoCA
   score >= 26) and 23 participants in Group 2 (cognitively impaired; MoCA
   score<26) were assessed. The mean time to completion of the study was
   19.1 (SD 3.6) minutes in Group 1 and 20.4 (3.4) minutes in Group 2. Mean
   feedback scores ranged from 3.80 to 4.48 (max=5) in favor of VR. The
   total performance score in Group 1 (552.0, SD 57.2) was higher than that
   in Group 2 (476.1, SD 61.9; P<.001) and exhibited a moderate positive
   correlation with scores from other cognitive screening tools:
   Abbreviated Mental Test (0.312), Mini-Mental State Examination (0.373),
   and MoCA (0.427). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for
   the relationship between the total performance score and the presence of
   cognitive impairment showed an area under curve of 0.821 (95\% CI
   0.714-0.928).
   Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of using a VR-based
   screening tool for cognitive function in older persons in primary care,
   who were largely in favor of this tool.},

Title = {Evaluation of Adaptive Feedback in a Smartphone-Based Game on Health
   Care Providers' Learning Gain: Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Background: Although smartphone-based emergency care training is more
   affordable than traditional avenues of training, it is still in its
   infancy, remains poorly implemented, and its current implementation
   modes tend to be invariant to the evolving learning needs of the
   intended users. In resource-limited settings, the use of such platforms
   coupled with gamified approaches remains largely unexplored, despite the
   lack of traditional training opportunities, and high mortality rates in
   these settings.
   Objective: The primary aim of this randomized experiment is to determine
   the effectiveness of offering adaptive versus standard feedback, on the
   learning gains of clinicians, through the use of a smartphone-based game
   that assessed their management of a simulated medical emergency. A
   secondary aim is to examine the effects of learner characteristics and
   learning spacing with repeated use of the game on the secondary outcome
   of individualized normalized learning gain.
   Methods: The experiment is aimed at clinicians who provide bedside
   neonatal care in low-income settings. Data were captured through an
   Android app installed on the study participants' personal phones. The
   intervention, which was based on successful attempts at a learning task,
   included adaptive feedback provided within the app to the experimental
   arm, whereas the control arm received standardized feedback. The primary
   end point was completion of the second learning session. Of the 572
   participants enrolled between February 2019 and July 2019, 247 (43.2\%)
   reached the primary endpoint. The primary outcome was standardized
   relative change in learning gains between the study arms as measured by
   the Morris G effect size. The secondary outcomes were the participants
   individualized normalized learning gains.
   Results: The effect of adaptive feedback on care providers' learning
   gain was found to be g=0.09 (95\% CI -0.31 to 0.46; P=.47). In
   exploratory analysis, using normalized learning gains, when
   subject-treatment interaction and differential time effect was
   controlled for, this effect increased significantly to 0.644 (95\% CI
   0.35 to 0.94; P<.001) with immediate repetition, which is a moderate
   learning effect, but reduced significantly by 0.28 after a week. The
   overall learning change from the app use in both arms was large and may
   have obscured a direct effect of feedback.
   Conclusions: There is a considerable learning gain between the first two
   rounds of learning with both forms of feedback and a small added benefit
   of adaptive feedback after controlling for learner differences. We
   suggest that linking the adaptive feedback provided to care providers to
   how they space their repeat learning session(s) may yield higher
   learning gains. Future work might explore in more depth the feedback
   content, in particular whether or not explanatory feedback (why answers
   were wrong) enhances learning more than reflective feedback (information
   about what the right answers are).},

Title = {A Study Protocol for Applying User Participation and Co-Learning-Lessons
   Learned from the eBalance Project},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The eBalance project is based on the idea that serious exergames-i.e.,
   computer gaming systems with an interface that requires physical
   exertion to play-that are well adapted to users, can become a
   substantial part of a solution to recognized problems of insufficient
   engagement in fall-prevention exercise and the high levels of
   fall-related injuries among older people. This project is carried out as
   a collaboration between eight older people who have an interest in
   balance training and met the inclusion criteria of independence in
   personal activities of daily living, access to and basic knowledge of a
   computer, four staff working with the rehabilitation of older adults,
   and an interdisciplinary group of six research coordinators covering the
   areas of geriatric care and rehabilitation, as well as information
   technology and computer science. This paper describes the study protocol
   of the project's initial phase which aims to develop a working
   partnership with potential users of fall-prevention exergames, including
   its conceptual underpinnings. The qualitative methodology was inspired
   by an ethnographical approach implying combining methods that allowed
   the design to evolve through the study based on the participants'
   reflections. A participatory and appreciative action and reflection
   (PAAR) approach, accompanied by inquiries inspired by the Normalization
   Process Theory (NPT) was used in interactive workshops, including
   exergame testing, and between workshop activities. Data were collected
   through audio recordings, photos, and different types of written
   documentation. The findings provide a description of the methodology
   thus developed and applied. They display a methodology that can be
   useful for the design and development of care service and innovations
   for older persons where user participation is in focus.},

Title = {Use of a Smartphone App to Increase Physical Activity Levels in
   Insufficiently Active Adults: Feasibility Sequential Multiple Assignment
   Randomized Trial (SMART)},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: The sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART)
   design allows for changes in the intervention during the trial period.
   Despite its potential and feasibility for defining the best sequence of
   interventions, so far, it has not been utilized in a smartphone/gamified
   intervention for physical activity.
   Objective: We aimed to investigate the feasibility of the SMART design
   for assessing the effects of a smartphone app intervention to improve
   physical activity in adults. We also aimed to describe the participants'
   perception regarding the protocol and the use of the app for physical
   activity qualitatively.
   Methods: We conducted a feasibility 24-week/two-stage SMART in which 18
   insufficiently active participants (<10,000 steps/day) were first
   randomized to group 1 (smartphone app only), group 2 (smartphone app +
   tailored messages), and a control group (usual routine during the
   protocol). Participants were motivated to increase their step count by
   at least 2000 steps/day each week. Based on the 12-week intermediate
   outcome, responders continued the intervention and nonresponders were
   rerandomized to subsequent treatment, including a new group 3
   (smartphone app + tailored messages + gamification) in which they were
   instructed to form groups to use several game elements available in the
   chosen app (Pacer). We considered responders as those with any positive
   slope in the linear relationship between weeks and steps per day at the
   end of the first stage of the intervention. We compared the
   accelerometer-based steps per day before and after the intervention, as
   well as the slopes of the app-based steps per day between the first and
   second stages of the intervention.
   Results: Twelve participants, including five controls, finished the
   intervention. We identified two responders in group 1. We did not
   observe relevant changes in the steps per day either throughout the
   intervention or compared with the control group. However, the
   rerandomization of five nonresponders led to a change in the slope of
   the steps per day (median -198 steps/day {[}IQR -279 to -103] to 20
   steps/day {[}IQR -204 to 145]; P=.08). Finally, in three participants
   from group 2, we observed an increase in the number of steps per day up
   to the sixth week, followed by an inflection to baseline values or even
   lower (ie, a quadratic relationship). The qualitative analysis showed
   that participants' reports could be classified into the following: (1)
   difficulty in managing the app and technology or problems with the
   device, (2) suitable response to the app, and (3) difficulties to
   achieve the goals.
   Conclusions: The SMART design was feasible and changed the behavior of
   steps per day after rerandomization. Rerandomization should be
   implemented earlier to take advantage of tailored messages.
   Additionally, difficulties with technology and realistic and
   individualized goals should be considered in interventions for physical
   activity using smartphones.},

Title = {Use of gamification strategies and tactics in mobile applications for
   smoking cessation: a review of the UK mobile app market},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective Mobile phone-based interventions have been proven to be
   effective tools for smoking cessation, at least in the short term.
   Gamification, that is, the use of game-design elements in a non-game
   context, has been associated with increased engagement and motivation,
   critical success factors for long-term success of mobile Health
   solutions. However, to date, no app review has examined the use of
   gamification in smoking cessation mobile apps. Our review aims to
   examine and quantify the use of gamification strategies (broad
   principles) and tactics (on-screen features) among existing mobile apps
   for smoking cessation in the UK.
   Methods The UK Android and iOS markets were searched in February 2018 to
   identify smoking cessation apps. 125 Android and 15 iOS apps were tested
   independently by two reviewers for primary functionalities, adherence to
   Five A smoking cessation guidelines, and adoption of gamification
   strategies and tactics. We examined differences between platforms with
   chi(2) tests. Correlation coefficients were calculated to explore the
   relationship between adherence to guidelines and gamification.
   Results The most common functionality of the 140 mobile apps we reviewed
   allowed users to track the days since/until the quit date (86.4\%). The
   most popular gamification strategy across both platforms was performance
   feedback (91.4\%). The majority of apps adopted a medium level of
   gamification strategies (55.0\%) and tactics (64.3\%). Few adopted high
   levels of gamification strategies (6.4\%) or tactics (5.0\%). No
   statistically significant differences between the two platforms were
   found regarding level of gamification (p>0.05) and weak correlations
   were found between adherence to Five A's and gamification strategies
   (r=0.38) and tactics (r=0.26).
   Conclusion The findings of this review show that a high level of
   gamification is adopted by a small minority of smoking cessation apps in
   the UK. Further exploration of the use of gamification in smoking
   cessation apps may provide insights into its role in smoking cessation.},

Title = {Assessment of cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis using
   smartphone-based training games: a feasibility study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 23},
Abstract = {Background Cognitive impairment occurs in up to 70\% of people with MS
   (pwMS) and has a large impact on quality of life and working capacity.
   As part of the development of a smartphone-app (dreaMS) for monitoring
   MS disease activity and progression, we assessed the feasibility and
   acceptance of using cognitive games as assessment tools for cognitive
   domains.
   Methods We integrated ten cognitive games in the dreaMS app.
   Participants were asked to play these games twice a week for 5 weeks.
   All subjects underwent a battery of established neuropsychological
   tests. User feedback on acceptance was obtained via a five-point
   Likert-scale questionnaire. We correlated game performance measures with
   predetermined reference tests (Spearman's rho) and analyzed differences
   between pwMS and Healthy Controls (rank biserial correlation).
   Results We included 31 pwMS (mean age 43.4 +/- 12.0 years; 68\% females;
   median Expanded Disability Status Scale score 3.0, range 1.0-6.0) and 31
   age- and sex-matched HC. All but one game showed moderate-strong
   correlations with their reference tests, (|r(s)|= 0.34-0.77).
   Performance improved in both groups over the 5 weeks. Average ratings
   for overall impression and meaningfulness were 4.6 (range 4.2-4.9) and
   4.7 (range 4.5-4.8), respectively.
   Conclusion Moderate-strong correlations with reference tests suggest
   that adaptive cognitive games may be used as measures of cognitive
   domains. The practice effects observed suggest that game-derived
   measures may capture change over time. All games were perceived as
   enjoyable and meaningful, features crucial for long-term adherence. Our
   results encourage further validation of adaptive cognitive games as
   monitoring tools for cognition in larger studies of longer duration.},

Title = {Video game disorder and mental wellbeing among university students: a
   cross-sectional study},
Journal = {PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Introduction: video games are a popular adult pastime but have a
   potentially pervasive negative influence on garners. The aim: was to
   determine the prevalence of video game disorder (VGD), its associated
   predictors, and its impact on the mental health of university students.
   Methods: a crosssectional study was performed with a convenience sample
   of 2,364 undergraduate students. Sociodemographic criteria, the Internet
   Gaming Disorder-20 (IGD-20) questionnaire, and the Mental Health-5
   (MH-5) questionnaire were used to collect data. The weights and heights
   of the students were self-reported. The average number of hours spent
   playing video games per week, the average number of hours of sleep per
   day, the favorite type of game played, and the main causes for playing
   were also included. Results: the prevalence of VGD among participants
   was 18.9\%. The main predictors of VGD were being male, residing in an
   urban area, playing more hours per week, sleeping fewer hours per day,
   and having a higher body mass index, while having a low socioeconomic
   status was a protective factor. Mental health had a strong negative
   correlation with VGD. The types of games most frequently played by video
   game addicts were violent and action games. However, the most frequent
   reasons cited for playing were to improve one's avatar, relaxation, and
   amusement. Conclusion: playing video games in moderation, adequate
   sleeping, and engaging in outdoor physical activities enhances mental
   well-being and physical functioning. Thus, it is critical to promote and
   encourage balanced, effective, stable approaches to video gaming among
   university students to maintain their mental well-being.},

Title = {Evaluation of user satisfaction and usability of a mobile app for
   smoking cessation},

Abstract = {Background: Mobile apps have a great potential to support patients in
   healthcare, and to encourage healthy behavioral changes such as smoking
   cessation. Nevertheless, the user rejection levels are still high. A set
   of factors that has impact on the app effectiveness is related to the
   quality of those features that lead to positive user experiences when
   using the app. This work aims to evaluate the user experience, and more
   specifically the usability and the user satisfaction with a mobile
   application for smoking cessation. This will also provide a basis for
   future improvements.
   Methods: We provided a smoking cessation mobile Android app to two
   different user cohorts, the smokers as valid users and the experts, for
   three weeks. The app featured usual functionalities to help quit
   smoking, including an achieved benefits section, mini-games to distract
   during cravings, and supportive motivational messages. We collected
   information about user experience, through game playability and message
   satisfaction questionnaires, and the experts' opinions. We also
   considered usage of app sections, the duration of the mini-game
   sessions, and the user ratings for motivational messages.
   Results: We included 45 valid users and 25 experts in this study. The
   questionnaire indicated 80\% satisfaction rate for the motivational
   messages. According to game questionnaires, over 69\% of the
   participants agreed that the games have good usability features,
   however, for questions related to mobility and gameplay heuristics,
   agreements were below 67\%. The most accessed app sections were achieved
   benefits and the one with motivational messages. The experts described
   issues that could help to improve the application.
   Conclusions: The combination of questionnaires with expert reports
   allowed to identify several problems and possible corrections. Our study
   showed that motivational messages have a good satisfaction rate,
   although it is necessary to consider technical features of some mobile
   devices that may hinder message reception. Games have good usability and
   it's expected that the addition of difficulty levels and a better
   accessibility to the game menu could make them more attractive and
   increase its usage. Future development of mHealth apps based on
   gamification and motivational messages need to consider these factors
   for better user satisfaction and usability. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Title = {A task-specific interactive game-based virtual reality rehabilitation
   system for patients with stroke: a usability test and two clinical
   experiments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 6},
Abstract = {Background: Virtual reality (VR) is not commonly used in clinical
   rehabilitation, and commercial VR gaming systems may have mixed effects
   in patients with stroke. Therefore, we developed RehabMaster (TM), a
   task-specific interactive game-based VR system for post-stroke
   rehabilitation of the upper extremities, and assessed its usability and
   clinical efficacy.
   Methods: A participatory design and usability tests were carried out for
   development of RehabMaster with representative user groups. Two clinical
   trials were then performed. The first was an observational study in
   which seven patients with chronic stroke received 30 minutes of
   RehabMaster intervention per day for two weeks. The second was a
   randomised controlled trial of 16 patients with acute or subacute stroke
   who received 10 sessions of conventional occupational therapy only
   (OT-only group) or conventional occupational therapy plus 20 minutes of
   RehabMaster intervention (RehabMaster + OT group). The Fugl-Meyer
   Assessment score (FMA), modified Barthel Index (MBI), adverse effects,
   and drop-out rate were recorded.
   Results: The requirements of a VR system for stroke rehabilitation were
   established and incorporated into RehabMaster. The reported advantages
   from the usability tests were improved attention, the immersive flow
   experience, and individualised intervention. The first clinical trial
   showed that the RehabMaster intervention improved the FMA (P =.03) and
   MBI (P =.04) across evaluation times. The second trial revealed that the
   addition of RehabMaster intervention tended to enhance the improvement
   in the FMA (P =.07) but did not affect the improvement in the MBI. One
   patient with chronic stroke left the trial, and no adverse effects were
   reported.
   Conclusions: The RehabMaster is a feasible and safe VR system for
   enhancing upper extremity function in patients with stroke.},

Title = {Building blocks for creating enjoyable games-A systematic literature
   review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {159},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Designing serious games that engage lots of players is still a
   challenge, especially for domains that introduce complex, specialised,
   and tedious tasks that are difficult to represent in a game in terms of
   entertainment. Therefore, researchers have investigated ways to motivate
   players, including enjoyment. Enjoyment is tied to emotional experience
   and is associated with positive player reactions throughout a gameplay
   session. However, an inventory with concrete elements (including
   descriptions and empirical proofs) producing that experience is missing.
   While researchers have investigated enjoyment and its relationship with
   game design elements (GDE), the efforts remain dispersed and isolated
   across different areas. Besides, there is no guideline describing this
   relationship that assists designers in their creation process.
   Therefore, this paper presents a systematic literature review to provide
   a detailed understanding of GDE, player enjoyment, and instruments for
   evaluation. Additionally, an analysis of two successful cases of Games
   With a Purpose (GWAP, a subset of serious games) for linguistics is
   presented to highlight the impact of the GDE and providing relationships
   with the GDE mentioned in this literature review. We found 33 GDE, from
   which 28 positively affect player enjoyment, and they can be used as
   building blocks to design enjoyable GWAP (or other serious games).
   Further, we create a list of instruments that provide an ample
   understanding of the constructs of player enjoyment, namely enjoyment,
   immersion, flow, positive affect, and presence. The listed instruments
   can give researchers higher confidence as they will allow replication
   and comparison of studies. These two components are critical in the
   process of design and evaluation of games. Furthermore, the GWAP
   analysis shows that effectively the GDE are used in GWAP to enhance
   interaction and player enjoyment. Finally, conclusions and practical
   suggestions for future work are given.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background. Serious games are gaining increasing prominence in
   environmental communication research, but their potential to form an
   integrated part of participatory research approaches is still strikingly
   understudied. This is particularly the case for applications of
   interactive digital formats in research on environmental challenges of
   high complexity, such as climate adaptation, which is a specifically
   suitable case as it involves complex interaction between climate systems
   and society, but where the response also involves trade-offs with
   potentially negative - maladaptive - outcomes. Intervention. This
   article presents the Maladaptation Game, which was designed to
   facilitate dialogue about potential negative outcomes of agricultural
   climate adaptation.
   Methods. We conducted test sessions with agricultural stakeholders in
   Finland and Sweden, and analysed quantitative and qualitative,
   audio-recorded and transcribed, material for opportunities and
   challenges related to dialogues, engagement, interactivity and
   experienced relevance.
   Results. The qualitative analysis of recorded dialogues shows that the
   Maladaptation Game has potential to support dialogue by challenging
   players to negotiate between options with negative outcomes. The
   gameplay itself presents opportunities in terms of creating engagement
   with options that provoke disagreement and debates between players, as
   well as interactivity, that players reflected upon as quick and easy,
   while challenges were related to the experienced relevance, in
   particular the options provided in the game, and its general framing.
   Conclusions. The results indicate a need for complementary approaches to
   this type of game but also suggest the importance of moderation when the
   game design is aimed at creating dialogue around a complex environmental
   challenge such as agricultural climate adaptation.},

Title = {Smoking prevention programs for girls},
Journal = {SALUD MENTAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {419-427},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {In recent years, the number of women who use tobacco has increased
   rapidly. Among youngsters, gender gap is closing, and the proportion of
   girls who smoke is already very similar to that of boys, with the added
   complication that the girls are more vulnerable to addiction, and
   tobacco use has severe consequences for their health and the well-being
   of their future children.
   The key to facing tobacco epidemic is prevention by strengthening
   protective factors and reducing risk factors that lead to smoking onset.
   School environment is the most valuable resource for anti-smoking
   programs. These efforts are commonly focused on elementary and secondary
   students because experimentation with tobacco and adoption of smoking
   behavior occur at this stage. There are three intervention models in
   schools: 1. Information model (or rational), 2. Social skills model (or
   affective), and 3. Social influence model, which emphasizes social
   environment as a critical factor in tobacco use. In this model the
   children are informed about the immediate negative effects of smoking
   (unfavorable effects on appearance, economic costs and social
   consequences such as rejection by others). The model also conveys a
   positive image of non-smokers as rational people, and a negative one of
   a smoker as someone vulnerable to advertising tricks. It uses the peer
   group for showing resistance to pressure and how to adopt and to
   maintain the decision not to smoke, and it teaches how to identify
   influences from tobacco advertising, peers and family. The social
   influence programs tend to be the most effective strategy for achieving
   at least some delay in onset of tobacco use.
   It is necessary to develop appropriate programs for each age and for a
   specific gender. Recently, researchers have begun using programs based
   on computer systems and Internet to prevent teen smoking.
   The aim of this study was to design, implement and evaluate two
   different types of tobacco prevention programs, tailored specifically
   for teenage girls. The programs were computer games and an interactive
   workshop, as well as the combination of both of them (games plus
   workshop). It was suggested that in treatment groups versus control
   group, smoking susceptibility scores (i.e., lack of a firm commitment to
   not smoke) would be lower in post test. It was also hypothesized that
   the games plus workshop group would affect the scores of the associated
   variables with susceptibility, and that changes would remain in the
   follow-up.
   Material and methods
   537 student girls in the three grades of secondary school were asked to
   answer the Smoking Susceptibility Scale. Out of this group, 160 girls
   that obtained the highest scores were selected, because they were
   considered at risk of becoming regular smokers.
   Six variables related with smoking susceptibility were also measured:
   Belief in the addictive property of tobacco, beliefs in smoking
   benefits, empathy with smoking victims, negative attitudes toward
   tobacco industry, skills rejecting social pressure to smoke, and
   identification of diseases associated with smoking in women.
   The Smoking Susceptibility Scale was applied at three moments of the
   measurement: A pre test (one week before programs starting), a post test
   (the last day of the program or programs), and a follow-up (four months
   after implementing the post test). In the last two occasions, the
   instruments of variables related with susceptibility were also applied.
   The two types of prevention programs (computer games and interactive
   workshop) were based on the social influence model. The purpose of the
   games was that the girls acquire skills to recognize and resist social
   pressures to smoke exerted by both the tobacco industry through
   advertising strategies, and their peers. The interactive workshop was
   designed according to the strategies of anti-smoking messages that have
   proved to be effective in order to prevent smoking; the immediate
   negative consequences suffered by smokers and the physical and
   psychological vulnerability of women produced by smoking were also
   highlighted.
   A mixed 4 inter-groups X 3 intra-groups design was applied (4
   treatments: Computer games, interactive workshop, games plus workshop,
   control, X 3 measurement times: Pre test, post test, follow-up). The 160
   participants were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups.
   The study consisted of four phases: pre test, treatment (one week
   later), post test (on completion of program implementation) and
   follow-up (four months after the post test).
   Results
   There was an immediate effect of the three treatments on the smoking
   susceptibility by contrasting pre test versus post test, but games plus
   workshop group had more effect than games or workshop ones. When
   comparing post test and follow-up measurements in the games plus
   workshop group versus the control group, it was found that smoking
   susceptibility scores of the treatment group stayed unchanged.
   For related variables, the girls who participated in the games plus
   workshop group had higher scores than the control group in the belief of
   tobacco addictive property, in empathy with smoking victims, in the
   negative attitude toward the tobacco industry, in the refusal skills
   towards social pressure to smoke, and in the identification of diseases
   associated with smoking in women, and lower scores on beliefs in the
   benefits of smoking (attractive appearance, emotional well-being,
   popularity and social acceptance). At the follow-up, it was observed
   that attitudes toward tobacco companies became even more negative and
   that participants identified more diseases caused by smoking in women
   than in the post test, i.e., the treatment effect was strengthened.
   Discussion
   The main guideline in the construction of smoking behavior prevention
   programs evaluated in this study was its focus on adolescent girls.
   Furthermore, they were only addressed to those adolescents with high
   scores on smoking susceptibility, due to the intention of using the
   available resources more efficiently. Another criterion taken into a
   count in order to build these programs was the shortness of the
   intervention.
   The results showed that smoking susceptibility on the participants of
   each one of the three treatment groups decreased from the pre test to
   the post test, but the decline was even greater in the games plus
   workshop group. The smoking susceptibility of the games plus workshop
   group remained low in the follow-up after four months of its
   implementation, which did not occur with the workshop or games groups
   alone. It appears that the more elements used in the prevention programs
   the greater their impact will be.
   Compared with the control group, the majority of variables related with
   smoking susceptibility were affected by the games plus workshop
   treatment.
   In conclusion, the combination of preventive programs for smoking
   addiction constructed in this study specifically for girls with the
   implementation of psychosocial principles and the use of computer
   technology decreased the smoking susceptibility on participants, as well
   as most of the related variables. Moreover, their effects persisted at
   least for a period of four months. Computer games, which were of
   interest to participants, could be easily installed on computer rooms of
   secondary schools, and even uploaded in the Internet, and its effects
   could be enhanced by an interactive workshop, which promotes
   interpersonal contact and discussion of false beliefs regarding tobacco
   use that girls support.
   The girls at risk who change their smoking susceptibility as a result of
   their participation in these smoking prevention programs will avoid the
   severe consequences of using tobacco and will gain years of healthy life
   for themselves and their descendants.},

Abstract = {We extend here the game-theoretic investigation made by d'Onofrio et al
   (2012) on the interplay between private vaccination choices and actions
   of the public health system (PHS) to favor vaccine propensity in
   SIR-type diseases. We focus here on three important features. First, we
   consider a SEIR type disease. Second, we focus on the role of seasonal
   fluctuations of the transmission rate. Third, by a simple population
   biology approach we derive - with a didactic aim- the game theoretic
   equation ruling the dynamics of vaccine propensity, without employing
   `economy related' concepts such as the payoff. By means of analytical
   and analytical approximate methods, we investigate the global stability
   of the of disease free equilibria. We show that in the general case the
   stability critically depends on the `shape' of the periodically varying
   transmission rate. In other words, the knowledge of the average
   transmission rate (ATR) is not enough to make inferences on the
   stability of the elimination equilibria, due to the presence of the
   class of latent subjects. In particular, we obtain that the amplitude of
   the oscillations favors the possible elimination of the disease by the
   action of the PHS, through a threshold condition. Indeed, for a given
   average value of the transmission rate, in absence of oscillations as
   well as for moderate oscillations, there is no disease elimination. On
   the contrary, if the amplitude exceeds a threshold value, the
   elimination of the disease is induced. We heuristically explain this
   apparently paradoxical phenomenon as a beneficial effect of the phase
   when the transmission rate is under its average value: the reduction of
   transmission rate (for example during holidays) under its annual average
   over compensates its increase during periods of intense contacts. We
   also investigate the conditions for the persistence of the disease.
   Numerical simulations support the theoretical predictions. Finally, we
   briefly investigate the qualitative behavior of the non autonomous
   system for SIR type disease, by showing that the stability of the
   elimination equilibria are, in such a case, determined by the ATR.},

Journal = {ACTA PAULISTA DE ENFERMAGEM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Abstract = {Objective: To assess a serious game as an educational strategy for
   children in a program to tackle overweight and obesity.
   Methods: This is methodological, quantitative and cross-sectional
   research. Children from a physical conditioning program with interactive
   games for obese and/or overweight children participated in the study
   (n=13). Participants' profile was made through anthropometric data,
   questionnaires about their eating habits and physical activity.
   Subsequently, the serious game DigesTower was presented as an additional
   strategy to the program and the game was assessed by the target
   audience.
   Results: Children aged seven to 11 years with overweight and obesity
   participated. DigesTower was well received by the participants, who
   claimed to have immersion, motivation and encouragement to improve their
   knowledge. The final version of the game was developed and made
   available online for free and publicly
   Conclusion: The study sought to encourage the use of innovative tools to
   assist as educational interventions in the field of childhood obesity
   and the serious game was assessed as a potential educational strategy
   for children. It is hoped that this study will inspire future research

Title = {Do Women in Nepal Like Playing a Mobile Game? MANTRA: A Mobile Gamified
   App for Improving Healthcare Seeking Behavior in Rural Nepal},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {In Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC), one of the causes of maternal
   and child mortality is a lack of medical knowledge and consequently the
   inability to seek timely healthcare. Mobile health (mHealth) technology
   is gradually becoming a universal intervention platform across the globe
   due to ubiquity of mobile phones and network coverage. MANTRA is a novel
   mHealth intervention developed to tackle maternal and child health
   issues through a serious mobile game app in rural Nepal, which
   demonstrated a statistically significant knowledge improvement in rural
   women. This paper explores the perceptions and usability of the MANTRA
   app amongst rural women and Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs)
   in Nepal. Despite the challenges of a target user group with limited
   educational levels and low smartphone experience, all participants
   viewed the MANTRA app with approval and enthusiasm. They were willing to
   engage further with the mHealth intervention and to share their
   experience and knowledge with fellow community members. Participants
   also showed an increase in awareness of danger signs enabling them to
   make better informed health decisions in the future. FCHVs viewed the
   app as a validation tool providing and support for greater impact of
   their efforts in rural Nepal. Growing mobile ownership, network coverage
   and availability of smartphones along with acceptance of the prototype
   MANTRA app in rural communities suggest encouraging prospects for
   mHealth interventions to be incorporated in the national health
   infrastructure in Nepal and other LMICs.},

   largest childhood obesity programme, MEND (Mind, Exercise,
   Nutrition...Do it!) (See ).
   DesignSemi-structured interviews were conducted with children who had
   completed the MEND obesity programme. Interviews were transcribed
   verbatim and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis
   (IPA).
   MethodFourteen children spanning diverse areas of London comprised this
   study (eight male, six female), aged between 11 and 14years and in
   secondary school. Participants were interviewed a year after completing
   one of the London-based MEND obesity programmes.
   ResultsThis article focuses on the most common and striking theme to
   emerge from the original dataset (The complete analysis may be found in
   L. Watson, Unpublished doctoral thesis): Fun. Subthemes were: going with
   the flow'; active participation in activities that led to new
   experiences (actually doing it' - seeing the fun side); the importance
   of others in the experience of fun (you do games in unity' - it's not as
   fun on your own').
   ConclusionChildren have fun when engaged in interactive and varied
   activities with opportunity for individual feedback and improvement.
   When designing childhood obesity programmes, conditions that optimise
   children's experience of fun should be emphasised over didactic and
   risk-heavy information pertaining to childhood obesity.
   What is already known on this subject?
   Continued growth in childhood obesity and its associated health
   problems, psychological effects, and economic burden make tackling
   childhood obesity a public health priority. Multicomponent lifestyle
   interventions to treat childhood obesity within the community have been
   shown to reduce overweight and obesity from pre- to post-treatment,
   increase self-esteem, and are found to be acceptable by parents. MEND is
   the most widely disseminated evidence-based programme of this kind in
   the United Kingdom.
   What does this study add?
   This study is the first qualitative study to explore the child's
   experience of attending MEND. The post-treatment maintenance period,
   where most behaviour change is consolidated (or not), is also captured
   in this study, with children interviewed at least 1year post-treatment.
   Findings unearthed an unexpected and strong theme - that of fun' -
   integral to their experience during their time at MEND. Optimizing
   conditions for fun is imperative to children's (and adults'?) engagement
   with, and maintenance of, healthy lifestyle activities.},

Abstract = {Demographic changes associated with an expanding and aging population
   will lead to an increasing number of orthopedic surgeries, such as joint
   replacements. To support patients' home exercise programs after total
   hip replacement and completing subsequent inpatient rehabilitation, a
   low-cost, smartphone-based augmented reality training game (TG) was
   developed. To evaluate its motion detection accuracy, data from 30
   healthy participants were recorded while using the TG. A 3D motion
   analysis system served as reference. The TG showed differences of 18.03
   mm to 24.98 mm along the anatomical axes. Surveying the main movement
   direction of the implemented exercises (squats, step-ups, side-steps),
   differences between 10.13 mm to 24.59 mm were measured. In summary, the
   accuracy of the TG's motion detection is sufficient for use in exergames
   and to quantify progress in patients' performance. Considering the
   findings of this study, the presented exer-game approach has potential
   as a low-cost, easily accessible support for patients in their home
   exercise program.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {215-226},
Abstract = {The article presents an analysis of innovative teaching technologies as
   a way to increase students' competitiveness. The author found that
   innovative technologies in education are information and communication
   technologies relying on computer-based learning. The structure, content
   of educational software, organization of Web-space are important when
   using innovative teaching technologies in English classes. We conducted
   the study in several stages: comparative analysis, synthesis,
   classification and systematization of the results of psychological and
   pedagogical, educational and methodological research; study of
   legislative acts, periodicals in order to identify the state of the
   research issue, and determining the directions of its solution, as well
   as subject, goal and objectives of the study. We used modelling to
   create situations of foreign language professional communication of
   future IT specialists. Empirical methods involved questionnaires used
   for identifying the motives of professional development and determining
   the features of the educational activities of future IT specialists in
   the process of training. The methods of mathematical statistics allowed
   to scientifically describe and systematize the obtained data, to
   identify the quantitative relationship between the studied phenomena, to
   analyse and summarize the results. We conducted a socio-psychological
   study during 2016 - 2019. It involved 255 first- and fourth-year
   students of National Technical University of Ukraine ``Igor Sikorsky
   Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.{''} Innovative information and communication
   technologies that improve the educational and cognitive activity of
   students, as well as increase the level of their knowledge have become
   important in teaching a foreign language in higher educational
   institutions. These technologies include MOODLE - Modular
   Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment, business game, integrated
   pedagogical technology, case study technology. Thus, the
   information-rich learning process in combination with the use of
   innovative technologies, well-organized e-learning, interactive training
   courses, multimedia tools improves the program of teaching and learning
   foreign languages in general, and English in particular, improves the
   level of knowledge of future IT specialists and motivation to study and
   learn foreign languages, allows students to use a variety of authentic
   materials. We state that all these factors influence the process of
   individualization of learning and contribute to the successful mastery
   of a foreign language.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the first results of the CONECT-ID project, which
   addresses young people's digital identities from the perspective of
   hyperconnectivity based on their perception of time in digital leisure.
   Its main objective is to analyse young people's time management and
   their hyper-connected perception of time. To do so, a qualitative study
   was performed using discussion groups with 130 participants organised in
   groups of respondents aged 12 to 16 and 16 to 18. Analysis was then
   performed using the NVivo software program. The results showed a
   difference in use and tools between the age groups. Both sets of groups
   claim to lose the concept of time, in particular the older ones. Younger
   respondents report having less availability of screens and more parental
   controls, while in contrast older ones state that they use the time
   management strategy less as self-regulation. School controls refer to
   students not being allowed to take mobile phones to school or use them
   there. It is apparent that the construction of young persons' identity
   is a continuum between different virtual spaces and times and face to
   face situations. Young people with less parental control over time
   management require more self-management and self-regulation mechanisms.
   The results found warrant focussing pedagogical discourse on designing
   and promoting quality educational actions that make it possible to go
   beyond setting limits. This can be achieved by working on establishing
   healthy interpersonal relationships, social and communication skills,
   and time management in a range of settings that provide lasting benefits
   beyond mere entertainment.},

Abstract = {Since a large variety of digital games have been used in many fields for
   educational purposes, their real functions in learning have caught much
   attention as well. This study first defines learning characteristics of
   problem-solving digital games and their corresponding cognitive levels,
   then designs and develops a problem-solving game in accordance to the
   criteria. Tasks in the game context are inter-related to each other so
   that players need to critically and creatively think about problem
   solutions. Learners' task analyses are performed to observe four
   elementary learners' gaming paths, behaviors and cognitive activities,
   individually and collaboratively. System documentation, video recording,
   researcher observation, and interviews are conducted to analyze
   learners' learning strategies and their cognitive performance during the
   gaming process.
   The research results show that different collaboration models,
   strategies, as well as atmospheres can greatly influence the
   performances of its members. In collaboration, each individual can have
   better learning effectiveness. Participants in positive and favorable
   collaborative relationships, regardless of the members' individual
   temperaments, can have much better cognitive performances. While group
   members are inter-dependent and have positive interactions, even
   slow-achievers have the possibility and opportunity to take the lead.

Journal = {SCIENTIA IRANICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2985-3004},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Originally, control mechanisms were proposed to replace the need for
   human intervention in operational environments and, thus, enhance the
   precision and reaction time. Nowadays, new requirements in computer
   systems such as adaptation have made the design of control mechanisms
   more challenging. The observer/controller pattern is one of the control
   mechanisms proposed to control many interacting independent elements
   with intelligent decisions. An important challenge of designing these
   mechanisms is that the knowledge needed for decision-making is provided
   by experts; therefore, the process becomes time consuming and costly,
   depending on the availability of experts and their costs. This study
   hypothesizes that employing a game With A Purpose can help improve the
   process of providing knowledge in such control mechanisms by using
   crowd-sourcing and involving non-expert humans in an enjoyable manner.
   This hypothesis was investigated by Macrophage+, a game with a purpose
   implemented for this goal. A number of experiments were conducted to
   evaluate Macrophage+, focusing on both its applicability and
   effectiveness in the context of the observer/controller pattern as well
   as its enjoyability for the players. The results show that Macrophage+
   is a successful game with a purpose that involves non-expert humans in
   the application of the observer/controller pattern. (C) 2020 Sharif

Abstract = {Objective: To design a smartphone app and evaluate its effect on
   promoting mental well-being and awareness of anxious symptoms in
   adolescents.Materials and Methods: A pilot cluster randomized controlled
   trial was conducted with two secondary schools (390 students, mean age
   13.1 years) randomized to the intervention and control groups. An app
   was designed to encourage ``Sharing, Mind, and Enjoyment (SME){''}
   between students and their parents (e.g., express gratitude), including
   interaction and game elements. The app was used daily over 1 month. The
   waitlist control group was offered the app after completing all
   assessments. The primary outcomes were changes in SME behaviors measured
   at 1 month and 3 months. Secondary outcomes included subjective
   happiness, well-being, personal health and happiness, family health,
   happiness and harmony, self-perceived knowledge, and understanding of
   anxious symptoms. Two focus groups of students and three individual
   in-depth interviews of community partners were conducted.Results:
   Seventeen of 152 students (11.2\%) in the intervention group used the
   app together with parents (adherent subgroup) and 69 (45.4\%) used it
   without involving parents. The intervention group did not show
   significant difference in the change of SME behaviors at 1- or 3-month
   follow-up compared with the control group. However, the intervention
   group reported greater increase in the awareness of anxious symptoms at
   follow-ups than the control group (d = 0.52 at 1 month and d = 0.43 at 3
   month, both P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis showed a significantly greater
   increase in SME-related behaviors in the adherent subgroup than the
   control group at 3 months (d = 0.46, P = 0.04). The interviews found
   favorable changes in app users, but motivation to use the app was low in
   general. Both students and community partners suggested primary school
   students would be more receptive users.Conclusions: The app did not show
   effectiveness in increasing SME behaviors of students, but increased
   awareness of anxious symptoms. Further improvements and tests are
   warranted.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03361475},

Abstract = {Background: The research on e-sports mainly concerns the relationship
   between game playing behavior and Internet addiction, especially among
   college students. It remained a question of how college students'
   e-sports playing was associated with their lifestyle behaviors and
   psychological well-being in China.Objectives: Our study aimed to explore
   whether collegiate e-sports players' e-sports participation behaviors
   differ across demographic backgrounds and how their e-sports playing
   relates to their lifestyle behaviors and psy-chological
   well-being.Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1441
   collegiate e-sports players in China. The demographic characteristics of
   collegiate e-sports players were explored. The Bivariate Person
   correlation, linear and Tobit regression analyses were used to examine
   how students' e-sports playing was related to their lifestyle behaviors
   (i.e., sleep quality and physical activity) and psychological well-being
   (mobile phone addiction, online game addiction, satisfaction with life,
   and perceived stress).Results: The results of independent t-test and
   ANOVA analyses revealed that students from different grades, majors,
   family residences, and family structures differed in their e-sports
   participation behaviors. The results of linear regression and Tobit
   regression analyses also revealed that students' e-sports participation
   behaviors were related to their lifestyle behaviors and psychological
   well-being, except for sleep quality and mobile phone addiction. It is
   noteworthy that the length of time in playing e-sports and e-sports
   consumption was related to different lifestyle behaviors and
   psychological well-being.Conclusion: The findings demonstrated that
   e-sports playing had penetrated college students' daily life.
   Appro-priate time arrangement and rational e-sports consumption are
   crucial in promoting a healthy lifestyle and psychological well-being

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aims: In light of the rise in research on technological addictions and
   smartphone addiction in particular, the aim of this paper was to review
   the relevant literature on the topic of smartphone addiction and
   determine whether this disorder exists or if it does not adequately
   satisfy the criteria for addiction. Methods: We reviewed quantitative
   and qualitative studies on smartphone addiction and analyzed their
   methods and conclusions to make a determination on the suitability of
   the diagnosis ``addiction{''} to excessive and problematic smartphone
   use. Results: Although the majority of research in the field declares
   that smartphones are addictive or takes the existence of smartphone
   addiction as granted, we did not find sufficient support from the
   addiction perspective to confirm the existence of smartphone addiction
   at this time. The behaviors observed in the research could be better
   labeled as problematic or maladaptive smartphone use and their
   consequences do not meet the severity levels of those caused by
   addiction. Discussion and conclusions: Addiction is a disorder with
   severe effects on physical and psychological health. A behavior may have
   a similar presentation as addiction in terms of excessive use, impulse
   control problems, and negative consequences, but that does not mean that
   it should be considered an addiction. We propose moving away from the
   addiction framework when studying technological behaviors and using
   other terms such as ``problematic use{''} to describe them. We recommend
   that problematic technology use is to be studied in its sociocultural
   context with an increased focus on its compensatory functions,
   motivations, and gratifications.},

Abstract = {Objective: Increased prevalence and penetration of cellphone and mobile
   Internet use have raised significant concerns about children's health
   and safety by offering new spaces for cyberbullying, harassment, and
   sexual misconduct. ``Cyberhero Mobile Safety'' is a videogame-based
   education program designed using tenets of the capacity model with the
   goal of instilling the knowledge and skills necessary to safely and
   productively navigate the mobile online environment. This study
   evaluates its usability, appeal, and perceived impact and usefulness.
   Materials and Methods: Six educational videogames were part of a program
   delivered to 3rd-6th grade students (n = 108) across six public schools
   in Upstate New York. Videogame play was electronically captured to
   evaluate usability. Likeability, acceptability, and perceived usefulness
   of videogame content were evaluated through postgame questionnaires.
   Results: Videogame usability criteria were achieved on 82.7 percent of
   the students' gameplays. On a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high), mean
   ratings were 4.09 (standard deviation {[}SD] = 1.28) for likeability,
   3.54 (SD = 1.61) for acceptability, and 4.16 (SD = 1.33) for perceived
   message usefulness.
   Conclusions: The ``Cyberhero Mobile Safety'' program is a feasible and
   potentially effective platform for delivering information about safe and
   healthy cellphone and Internet use to children. Results support the use
   of the capacity model to design educational videogames because games
   that aligned with theory principles were reported as having the most
   impact and being the most useful at shifting children's online
   behaviors. Future research should directly test the individual
   components of the capacity model to inform educational game design.},

Abstract = {Background and aim Serious games are interactive games with a purpose
   for education, developed generally under software technology, serious
   games also include tabletop games (board games and card games), and many
   of them are used in medical settings like hospital training. Previous
   work indicates that serious games can enhance students' motivation,
   interaction, and engagement. This study aimed to evaluate the
   effectiveness of a serious game on medical students' learning outcomes
   and determine its effect on students' flow and motivation and examine
   the relationship between the flow and motivation. Methods This was a
   prospective study performed for two years (2018-2019 and 2019-2020
   academic years). A total of 108 third-year medical students participated
   in this study. Students were asked to play a serious game on a computer
   for twenty minutes. A set of questionnaires containing evaluation grids
   to measure the flow and the motivation were given to students. The
   effectiveness of the game was assessed using pre-and post-tests. Results
   Complete datasets were available for 97 students. Flow and motivation
   dimensions experienced by the students were generally high (mean =
   54,5). Significant and positive relationships between the sub-scale of
   flow experience and intrinsic motivation to know, intrinsic motivation
   to experience simulation, and the three types of extrinsic motivation
   were found. There was a negative correlation between the flow dimension
   and intrinsic motivation toward accomplishments and amotivation. There
   was a significant difference between the mean scores of pre-tests and
   post-tests (p < .01). Conclusion The serious game is regarded as a
   particularly active and problem-solving form of learning that promote
   medical students' motivation, flow and learning achievements.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the effects of a technology-based engagement
   platform, referred to as IMPRES (Interactive Mobile Platform for
   Retaining and Engaging Students). IMPRES is a mobile application, backed
   by a set of data analysis services, which seeks to engage and retain its
   users to enhance their professional development. The primary goal of the
   application is to enhance students' engagement in their college and
   improve student retention. The method is influenced by and evaluated
   from the standpoints of four theoretical models previously used in
   research on the effect of a computer interface on user behavior. First,
   the self-determination theory perspective on digital games explains
   users' motivation. Second, social identity theory explains users'
   psychological connections to their college. Third, continuance theory
   explains continuity of users' engagement. Finally, the persuasive system
   design perspective associates IMPRES's features with users' motivation.
   By integrating these theories, we develop and find much support for a
   model of IMPRES's effects on students' intent to continue their studies.
   This research makes a unique contribution to continuance theory by
   demonstrating how an application's persuasive design features not only
   foster continued use of the application but also continued engagement
   with an organization.},

Title = {Presence Promotes Performance on a Virtual Spatial Cognition Task:
   Impact of Human Factors on Virtual Reality Assessment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VIRTUAL REALITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {1},
Month = {OCT 29},
Abstract = {The use of virtual reality in spatial cognition evaluation has been
   growing rapidly, mainly because of its potential applications in the
   training and diagnosis of cognitive impairment and its ability to blend
   experimental control and ecological validity. However, there are still
   many gray areas on virtual reality, notably on the sense of presence and
   its complex relationship to task performance. Performance in VR is often
   suggested to be influenced by other human factors including, amongst
   others, cybersickness, gender, video game experience, and field
   dependence. Would an individual experiencing more presence
   systematically show better performance? This study aimed to be part of a
   framework of virtual reality as this question is fundamental for
   rigorous assessment and diagnostics, and particularly in the spatial
   cognition field. Forty-eight healthy young subjects were recruited to
   take part in a virtual spatial cognition evaluation. Spatial cognition
   performance, along with their level of presence, cybersickness, video
   game experience, gender and field dependence, were measured. Matrix
   correlations were used, along with linear regressions and mediation
   analysis. Results show that presence promoted performance on the spatial
   cognition evaluation, while cybersickness symptoms hindered it, notably
   among women. The presence-performance relationship was not mediated by
   other human factors. Video game experience significantly predicted both
   sense of presence and cybersickness, the latter two being negatively
   correlated. Even if women experienced more negative symptoms than men,
   gender appears less informative than cybersickness and video game
   experience. Field dependence was not associated with any other variable.
   Results are discussed by confronting two theories of cognition
   (representational vs. ecological), highlighting that virtual reality is
   not a simple transposition of reality but truly a new paradigm with its
   own biases favoring some individuals more than others, and that some
   human factors have to be controlled for rigorous uses of virtual
   environments, particularly for spatial cognition evaluation.},

Title = {Game-based learning apps in engineering education: requirements, design
   and reception among students},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 22},
Abstract = {There is a lack of research on how game-based learning apps should be
   designed for engineering education. This paper addresses two research
   questions: What do engineering students expect from a learning app?
   Which educational approach and learning app design can meet these
   requirements? A survey revealed the particular demands of engineering
   students when using learning apps. They prefer apps that promote
   transfer of learning. They value a diversified game environment that
   leaves room for self-determined decisions. They want to use learning
   apps during five-minute breaks or on-the-go. Social interaction is only
   of minor importance. Concrete design and content guidelines are derived.
   Perceptual learning is an appropriate educational approach to meet the
   requirements. Two universally applicable task types for engineering
   education are discussed. A case study was conducted to investigate their
   use in practice. Following the guidelines, an app for
   heat-and-mass-transfer was generated and its impact on teaching was
   evaluated. Students considered that their requirements were met. This is
   reflected in the usage statistics: During one semester, 545 different
   students played a total of 27,350 games. As a measure of learning
   progress, the average score per game almost tripled. Apps that follow
   the guidelines have the potential to become well-accepted learning
   tools.},

Title = {Cosmetic dentistry: A socioethical evaluation},
Journal = {BIOETHICS},

Volume = {32},

Pages = {602-610},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Biomedically, the mouth is often described as a ``window on the
   body{''}; many systemic health issues may manifest in the oral cavity.
   The metaphor of a ``window{''} also holds true for the sociological
   impact of the mouth; judgements and assumptions about social status and
   affluence may often be made based on dental appearance. The mouth may be
   used by society to determine the value a person is perceived to place on
   self-care. Those who are afflicted with dental disease, and therefore
   have poor dental appearance, are often assumed to be neglectful. Given
   the importance that is placed upon the appearance of the mouth, it is no
   surprise that cosmetic dentistry has developed as a service offered by
   the profession, with novel treatments becoming popular as a way of
   changing dental appearance. The development of cosmetic medicine has
   enjoyed wide discussion within the sociological literature. Whilst
   dentistry has undeniably evolved from medicine, and therefore shares
   many parallels concerning ethical and social considerations, dentistry
   differs fundamentally in its organisation, the nature of the conditions
   most commonly managed and the expectations of patients seeking care.
   This article investigates the socioethical issues specifically raised by
   cosmetic dentistry. The dental profession's scope as the protectors and
   restorers of the oral cavity from the effects of dental disease has now
   expanded to include the treatment of the flawed smile. Some within the
   dental profession advocate for commentary on dental appearance to be
   made to patients as routine practice, accompanied by associated
   recommendations for possible treatments to rectify perceived
   deficiencies. The place of cosmetic dentistry as a legitimate
   professional pursuit has not been explored widely. Comprehensive
   explorations come from Welie, who analyses both the professional and
   moral status of cosmetic intervention within the sphere of medicine and
   dentistry, and from Ozar and Sokol, who consider the place of aesthetic
   values in relation to other central values in the profession. This
   article examines closely how cosmetic dentistry is classified and the
   consequences of this upon the position of cosmetic dentistry as
   discipline. The inclusion of dentistry in the discussion of the position
   of cosmetic procedures within medicine is fraught. Whilst the origins of
   dentistry are from medicine, the nature of dentistry has become somewhat
   different from its progenitor; the consequences of this in relation to
   the classification of cosmetic dentistry cannot be overlooked. Within
   this study of cosmetic dentistry, the reader will note the use of both
   ``patient{''} and ``consumer{''} as terms to describe those who may seek
   the services of healthcare professionals. It is noticeable within modern
   society that many who would have once considered themselves to be
   patients, now place themselves in the role of consumers, and would
   describe themselves as such. To place an immediate value upon this as a
   negative sign of the increased influence of commercial pressures within
   healthcare would be unreasonable. To be described as a consumer, confers
   the assumption of a set of rights relating to how one must be treated.
   Consumers are powerful; emphasis is placed upon their ability to ``vote
   with their feet{''} and thusly control the quality of service that they
   receive. Increased choice and freedom to exercise this are also
   hallmarks of the modern consumer of health services.
   Whilst contemporary discourses upon the role and status of the patient
   state largely the same, the descriptor would seem only to be held dear
   to the health professions and those who study them. There is also a
   potential negative aspect to the introduction of the healthcare
   consumer; one where the overarching professional duties to do no harm
   and to engage in the exercise of informed consent seem less important.
   Here, respecting the ultimate authority of the health consumer to
   dictate the service that they would like to receive is viewed by many
   professionals to be equivalent to patient primacy. Where those who seek
   care are described in this study as being consumers, it is a reference
   to the status of those seeking treatment as being empowered, and equal
   to those who provide treatment. It is also an acknowledgement of the
   rights of care-seekers to be treated as ends in themselves, rather than
   as means to ends. Where the negative aspects of consumerism in
   healthcare are encountered, these will be explicitly addressed. This
   article will have three main areas of discussion. Firstly, the common
   assertion that cosmetic dentistry is separate from the rest of
   dentistry, as is often claimed of cosmetic surgery and medicine, will be
   explored and challenged. In doing this, Foucault's concept of ``care of
   the self{''} will be used to understand a possible framework where
   cosmetic dentistry may become a legitimate part of healthcare; the
   pursuit of self-improvement being an integral aspect of well-being.
   Secondly, the relationship between cosmetic dentistry and
   commercialisation of healthcare will be examined. How cosmetic dentistry
   may be portrayed and ``sold{''} to patients, and the tensions that this
   may lead to in relation to notions of professionalism. This is an
   important branch in the narrative surrounding cosmetic dentistry but
   raises questions that are relevant to professional ethics rather than
   definitions of cosmetic improvement in the oral cavity. Lastly, another
   concept described by Foucault will be applied to cosmetic dentistry. The
   idea of the ``dental gaze{''} suggests that the cosmetic enhancements
   offered by the dental profession offer a socially mediated control on
   the concept of the ideal smile. The way that this is often enforced
   through professional discipline will be explored and critiqued. This
   study will examine the extent to which criticisms of the professional
   status of cosmetic dentistry still apply to contempory practice.
   Foucault outlined his theory of care of the self in the second and third
   volumes of the History of Sexuality. This idea of ethics examined
   practices that an individual might engage in, so as to transform their
   own mode of being. An important aspect of this ethics is the challenge
   to the established pursuit of the ``hermeneutics of the subject,{''}
   with Foucault placing emphasis upon the care of the self, rather than
   self-knowledge. Foucault analysed Ancient Greek and Roman texts,
   developing ideas of how individuals might form themselves as ethical
   subjects, enabling transformation. The Ancient Greeks took this as how
   one might live well, whilst under the Romans, this evolved to be
   concerned with developing the ``good-self.{''} He stated the practices
   facilitating this development to be; ``the procedures, which no doubt
   exist in every civilisation, offered or prescribed to individuals in
   order to determine their identity, maintain it, transform it in terms of
   a certain number of ends.
   `` Care of the self is characterised by a continual process of
   self-improvement that may be achieved by many processes, including;
   self-reflection, self-examination, self-decipherment and
   self-transformation. Foucault does not pose care of the self to be an
   obligative duty; it is instead positioned as an ethics that encourages
   active freedom to engage in processes of cultivation of the self. The
   concept of care of the self would appear to have implications for
   cosmetic treatments as acts within the process of self-cultivation.
   Cosmetic enhancement could be positioned to be an act of
   self-improvement in line with care of the self; Foucault termed them to
   be, ``technologies of the self.{''} If through introspection, an
   individual becomes aware of a perceived deficit in their appearance that
   negatively impacts upon their confidence and self-esteem, having this
   addressed through cosmetic intervention would be a positive ethical act.
   Through the ethics of care of the self, we see the normalisation of
   cosmetic treatment and the removal of the stigma of vanity, and the
   concept of self-improvement being incorporated within the wider
   definition of health. Through this, cosmetic intervention may be seen
   as; ``a primary mode for articulating the authentic, healthy and happy
   self.{''} Cosmetic interventions provided by healthcare practitioners
   cause definitional difficulty. It is traditionally a point of dispute as
   to whether cosmetic surgery forms a legitimate aspect of healthcare
   practice. Proponents of medical professionalism have suggested that the
   social contract existent between the health professions and society
   places the purpose of medicine to be the treatment of disease and
   alleviation of suffering. Cosmetic interventions are specifically
   excluded from this concept of medical purpose, due to their nature as
   non-therapeutic procedures within strict definitions of health. Because
   of this lack of legitimacy in line with the given parameters of
   medicine, historically, cosmetic surgery has been considered by early
   physicians; ``to be minor, without healing purpose, and relegated to
   lay-practitioners.{''} Many surgeons would also refuse to perform
   cosmetic surgery, terming it ``beauty surgery.{''} More difficult than
   addressing whether cosmetic surgery is a legitimate part of medicine, is
   addressing the question of how cosmetic dentistry integrates with the
   rest of the pursuits of the dental profession. Oral Health is defined by
   the WHO to be; ``essential to general health and quality of life. It is
   a state of being free from mouth and facial pain, oral and throat
   cancer, oral infection and sores, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth
   decay, tooth loss, and other diseases and disorders that limit an
   individual's capacity in biting, chewing, smiling, speaking, and
   psychosocial wellbeing.{''} Whilst undoubtedly biomedical in focus, the
   definition does reference the capacity to smile and the effects of
   deficiencies in this ability upon psychosocial wellbeing to be firmly
   part of oral health. Concepts of this strong association between
   psycho-social and traditional biomedical factors, are made clearer by
   The World Dental Federation (FDI), who define oral health as;
   ``multi-faceted and includes the ability to speak, smile, smell, taste,
   touch, chew, swallow and convey a range of emotions through facial
   expressions with confidence and without pain, discomfort and disease of
   the craniofacial complex.
   `` This definition again references smiling and includes the concept
   that being able to do so with confidence to be an integral part of oral
   health. Ozar and Sokol recognise the importance of aesthetic values
   within dental practice. They acknowledge that dental professionals who
   paid no attention to aesthetic values would be failing professionally,
   both from the perspectives of their professional peers, and from the
   public utilising their services. Because of this, they place aesthetics
   as a core tenent of the profession's values. Despite this recognition,
   within their ranking of core values, aesthetics is separated from
   consideration as part of oral health, which is placed as a higher value
   than aesthetics. Some have advocated that, as with medicine, a strict
   demarcation exists in the professional status between dentistry carried
   out for therapeutic reasons and that which is carried out for cosmetic
   purposes. Welie states that; ``ugliness is not a medical indication; it
   does not necessitate medical treatment in the same way that a toothache,
   gingivitis or oral cancer does.{''} He also states that the professional
   status of dentistry is lost when dentists focus their practices upon the
   provision of purely aesthetic interventions. The issue of what
   constitutes a cosmetic or a medical issue is dealt with by Welie by
   distinguishing between conditions which are healing and those that are
   enhancing. He uses two examples of similar conditions which both affect
   dental appearance; firstly, that of cleft-lip and palate, and secondly,
   the crowding and misalignment of teeth in malocclusion. Welie suggests
   the term ``integrity{''} as a synonym for health. He questions whether
   the aesthetic considerations of repairing a cleft-lip and palate is any
   more medically justified than that orthodontic treatment. He states that
   integrity is not violated by having an ugly appearance and that whilst
   aesthetic considerations and side-effects are important; they are not
   within the realms of medical consideration. Therefore, aside from fixing
   any functional deformity, both procedures fail to count as being medical
   procedures if carried out solely on the basis of dental appearance.
   Welie places culture as the main determination as to why perceived
   defects in dental appearance are considered to violate integrity; it is
   social environment that determines attractiveness. He questions whether
   the improvement of a person's appearance restores integrity, thus making
   it a bona fide medical intervention, or whether it is an enhancement
   because ugliness is not a contraindication to integrity. It is of note
   that Welie does not recognise any differences between the fundamental
   purposes of medical and dental practice; classing both to have equal
   foundations within the tradition of treating pathology and pain only.
   The heavy burden of justification upon cosmetic dentistry is derived
   from its subjective nature. Orthodontics in not questioned in the same
   way, despite relying upon the same subjective reasoning for providing
   treatment. Certainly, by the categorisations of Welie, orthodontics is
   undoubtedly non-medical in nature, unless aesthetics is not the primary
   reason for treatment. The intrinsic difference that would seem to exist
   in other areas of cosmetics and general health is the idea that in
   cosmetic interventions, the objective is to make the patient more, or
   better than, well rather than to restore health. Again, in dentistry
   this point of differentiation struggles to find legitimacy, especially
   so if the ethics of self-care are considered.
   Rose stated; ``The old lines between treatment, correction, and
   enhancement can no longer be sustained.{''} The apparent lack of
   distinction between general dentists and ``cosmetic dentists{''} is also
   testament to the close alignment between cosmetic dentistry and
   professional activities that treat oral disease. The Health Care
   Complaints Commission in NSW, Australia stated that; ``A central
   characteristic of cosmetic surgery is that it is initiated by the
   consumer to improve their appearance and self-esteem.{''} Cosmetic
   dentistry (and the whole cosmetic discipline) is patient driven, which
   places cosmetic dentistry in line with ideals of bioethics and consumer
   culture, where those seeking treatment are empowered. If the traditional
   purpose of dentistry is expanded to accept the practice of cosmetic
   dentistry, this new goal of beauty as a good available to consumers,
   aligns with the reduction of power and authority held by clinicians and
   with the desire to enhance patient autonomy. Exley suggests that
   cosmetic dentistry may continue to develop as a normalised aspect of
   self-care, in the same manner as toothbrushing has become an integral
   part of most home-healthcare regimes. In this comparison, Exley quotes
   Davis, who suggests that the rise in the use of toothpastes was, ``a
   social trend greatly aided by the efforts of commercial interests.{''}
   The social demand to have an aesthetically pleasing smile has also
   driven the popularity of tooth-brushing. The introduction of active
   whitening ingredients into many toothpastes, reinforces Exley's
   comparison and suggests that the social acceptability of dental cosmetic
   enhancement is likely to sustain its growth in popularity, becoming
   accepted as part of everyday routine. The triptych of absence that
   determines the nature of a procedure to be cosmetic is; firstly, the
   absence of a patient, instead a consumer seeks and initiates treatment;
   secondly, the absence of pathology and; thirdly, the absence of a
   therapeutic purpose. Originally, cosmetic surgery was justified through
   being claimed to act as a psychiatric intervention. As improvements to
   confidence and self-esteem began to be seen by society as legitimate
   justifications to cosmetic intervention, much virtue is derived from the
   desire of the public to seek such treatment. The desire to create
   improvement of appearance and development of both self-esteem and
   confidence are ubiquitous within all dental treatments. Given this
   universality, as well as the empowerment of all patients as health
   consumers, it is difficult to really distinguish between many cosmetic
   and traditionally therapeutic treatments in dentistry. Further evidence
   towards the concept of there being little difference between cosmetic,
   and the rest of dentistry, is the existence of the idea of aesthetic
   failure which is a routine consideration in dental practice. Aesthetic
   failure occurs when a restoration remains structurally and functionally
   sound but loses its aesthetic properties. This, for many (including
   those who may think dimly of cosmetic treatments), is justification
   enough for removal and replacement. Aesthetics is a primary
   consideration for the majority of dental procedures, often being the
   only consideration for many patients. This in a stark contrast to
   medicine, where aesthetics often becomes a secondary consideration; for
   example, an unsightly scar is perhaps a small price to pay for a
   successful, life-sustaining surgery.
   References to the mental health of those seeking cosmetic treatments are
   made by the Medical Board of Australia and General Medical Council (UK)
   in their regulatory guidance. Medical practitioners providing cosmetic
   treatments are obliged to consider the need for independent
   psychological assessment. There is no equivalent guidance from the
   Dental Board of Australia or the General Dental Council (UK). This
   absence may indicate a more relaxed attitude within society towards
   dental enhancement, that to require practitioners to refer when
   concurrent psychological morbidity presents would be unrealistic and
   ultimately irrelevant in the majority of cases. However, a more relaxed
   position does not mean there is any less requirement for awareness of
   patients seeking cosmetic dentistry who may be suffering with body
   dysmorphic disorder. Treatment of these individuals with cosmetic
   dentistry, without addressing any underlying psychological pathology,
   would not contribute to the increasing of well-being and human
   flourishing. Therefore, the essential element that the ethics of care of
   the self would require to qualify an intervention as ethical is missing,
   rendering the treatment unjustifiable through this theoretical
   framework. In summary, cosmetic dentistry would seem to be included
   within the definition of professional dentistry. To exclude it on the
   belief that improvements in self-esteem and confidence are trivial and
   non-bona fide justifications deny the widened definition of oral health
   given by both the WHO and the FDI. It would also serve to excise a large
   portion of the dental profession, the main role of which is to provide
   treatments which primarily improve dental appearance. The dental
   professional goals of yesteryear may have been firmly fixed upon
   alleviation of suffering. However, in the 21st Century it seems somehow
   denialist to suggest that the improvement of confidence and self-esteem
   is not part of the professional purpose of the dental profession. Data
   pertaining to cosmetic dentistry is scant, the American Academy of
   Cosmetic Dentistry (AACD) reported that 86\% of patients seen by their
   surveyed members reported that their main reason for seeking cosmetic
   dental treatment was an improvement in self-esteem. It is of note that
   the next greatest reason (at 51\%) was the correction of previously
   failed cosmetic treatment. The Academy does not elaborate upon what is
   defined to be a failure; this could be structural failure or aesthetic
   failure, where the cosmetic expectations of patients are not met, either
   immediately or sometime after the procedure. It is difficult to
   reconcile ideas of cosmetic treatment as an ethical methodology of care
   of the self, with the image on the front cover of the AACD report. The
   picture is of a mouth being examined with a common dental mirror. In the
   mirror, it isn't the patient (or consumer) who is reflected; but the
   face of George Washington, taken from the US one-dollar bill. It is this
   overt reference to the financial reward of cosmetic dentistry, that
   leads to concerns about the relationship between cosmetic dentistry,
   ethics and professional culture. The semiotics of this image would
   suggest that it is not the needs of the patient that are reflected in
   the practice of cosmetic dentistry. Instead, the image suggests it is
   profit and personal reward that is the driving-force in providing these
   services. Cosmetic dentistry and surgery is often justified by reference
   to consumer culture and psychological well-being.
   The narrative of consumer rights and psychological imperatives within
   cosmetic disciplines is dominant, with procedures being justified purely
   on the basis that patients have demanded them. Whilst respect for the
   patient as an autonomous being is the key-stone of any patient-clinician
   relationship, the idea of the truly equal clinical interaction is a
   myth. There is commonly a disparity in knowledge between patient and
   clinician regarding dental treatment. There is a problem with valid
   consent if it is not used to promote the freedom of a patient through
   attempts to reduce this informational inequality. For example, we may
   fully accept a patient's right to seek a cosmetic dental treatment,
   however, many of these are highly destructive and are likely to carry
   with them serious repercussions for future oral health and treatment
   need. For a patient to make a truly free choice, they need to be made
   aware of this. This is where the ``new{''} paradigm of the patient as a
   consumer struggles; the professional nature of dentistry requires for
   the patient to be told of this risk and possible alternatives. The
   provision of treatment as a commercial good on the presumption that the
   patient pays their money and takes their choice (or chance), pushes
   dentistry away from its professional obligation of effacement of
   self-interest and patient primacy. This tension reveals the issues of
   viewing cosmetic dentistry to be a consumer-product rather than a bona
   fide therapeutic intervention, carried out as a full part of the
   professional purpose. When taken as a consumer product, the emphasis of
   treatment becomes one of an indulgence; a consumer luxury where the
   consumer expects their rights of autonomy to be absolute. Here we see
   the evolution of the dental surgery into the ``dental spa,{''} with the
   world of the beauty industry and clinician colliding. This paradigm
   leaves little room for the therapeutic alliance; where the skill of the
   clinician is utilised within a framework of professional (rather than
   consumer) duty and expectation. The view of the patient as an empowered
   consumer is to be encouraged, but only in so far as the professional
   status and associated obligations that accompany this are preserved. The
   spa-model of dental practice finds procedures to be marketed as ``pamper
   products.{''} Botox, lip-fillers and teeth whitening have seen a surge
   in popularity within the dental armamentarium. This is despite many
   regulators of the dental professions worldwide stating almost
   universally that cosmetic injectables have limited place in the practice
   of dentistry. The rise in the portrayal of cosmetic dentistry as being a
   luxurious and pleasurable experience links with the concept that
   self-improvement through enhancement is fun and exciting. Dental
   tourism, like its counterpart in the medical industry, is perhaps the
   ultimate demonstration of this combination between pleasure and cosmetic
   enhancement. Within medicine, clinicians often argue that ``medical
   spas{''} are in fact clinics, with preference for the use of medicalised
   terminology to describe the premises and procedures. This is in contrast
   to many dental surgeries that focus upon cosmetic treatments in
   preference to other forms of traditional dentistry, where practitioners
   seek to distance themselves from the perceived discomfort of
   conventional dental procedures. The initiation of many treatments within
   dental practice is patient-driven, but the treatments are not
   necessarily cosmetic in nature.
   The rise of insurance to cover the costs of oral health needs has
   contributed to dentistry be more consumer-focused. Patients may attend
   for a professional clean, with little therapeutic need, in part because
   they feel it is owed to them for having paid for insurance. This is a
   phenomenon that has no equivalent in medicine; those with private
   medical insurance would be unlikely to seek a medical consultation and
   treatment, simply because they felt that they had paid for it through
   insurance. The focus upon getting patients into the chair has led to
   many dentists offering free consultations. Bishop quotes Dr Harlan
   Pollock, a plastic surgeon, who is critical of such offers, stating;
   ``Free consultations are a gimmick that are used in obtaining patients
   and they're worth about what they cost horizontal ellipsis They are an
   opportunity to sell an operation and serve very little purpose.{''} Many
   cosmetic treatments, such as veneers, teeth whitening and facial
   injectables, are both the instruments for obtaining a desired effect,
   and the effect in themselves. The unnatural, bright, white and perfectly
   aligned smile or swollen and puckered lips are overt status symbols in
   their own rights and sought after by many for that reason. Franks gives
   three parameters to consumerism; 1) the pleasure of spending money and
   conspicuous consumerism; 2) relentlessness and transience, whereby
   enough is never enough and; 3) the individualisation of the bases and
   morality of action. In the context of cosmetic dentistry, this may lead
   to consumers seeking whiter, brighter and more accentuated dental
   appearances. Leiss articulates this as the practice where; ``(T)he needs
   of self-esteem and self-actualization are expressed and pursued through
   the purchase of commodities.{''} The push for ever brighter teeth can be
   seen within the instruments of the dentist. At one time, the ``A1{''}
   shade was the brightest that was achievable; composite filling
   materials, porcelain shades and artificial teeth for dentures were made
   to conform to this scale. This is no longer the case; the popularity of
   procedures such as tooth whitening have led to the development of
   brighter shades. Dentists report that for many, the old maximum of A1
   has become inadequate. The perceived neo-liberal entitlement to spend
   resources as an individual deems fit, is an element which society is
   oriented to defend and preserve. Where cosmetic dentistry is
   particularly challenging is where patients develop unrealistic
   expectations, through advertising or direct clinician salesmanship.
   Where this happens, the development of perceived needs which do not
   exist, or real needs that are addressed with irrelevant objects, may
   lead patients to have treatment that is inappropriate. This is where
   dental practitioners have a need to be robust in the way that they
   discuss treatments and expectations with patients. Advertising, whilst
   having the potential to be manipulative, cannot be said to always create
   false needs. It is easy in this circumstance to use this criticism of
   consumerism to negate the possibility of cosmetic dentistry being
   provided justifiably. Leiss states that needs and objects define one
   another, that ultimately, both real and manipulated needs are
   underpinned by individual values. The judgement of clinicians, who might
   feel that the perceived cosmetic defect does not warrant the
   intervention, asserts one aesthetic ideal over another.
   The act of refusing to provide treatment on this basis, rather than on a
   basis of judgement on clinical appropriateness, valorises the
   clinician's view of what is aesthetic. Patients are told that treatment
   is not possible on the basis that it does not strictly adhere to the
   normative view of what should be treated. This needs to be accepted as a
   socially mediated response, that imposes the beliefs of the clinician,
   onto the patient and judges them based on that schema. Commercialised
   models of dentistry encourage dental skill to be thought of as a
   commodity, owned by dental practitioners, available only to those who
   might be able to pay. As discussed, this contributes to the perception
   of dentistry to be a luxury good. This applies to all circumstances
   where dentistry is commodified, not only in consideration of cosmetic
   practice. In this circumstance, the cost, availability and quality of
   treatment are determined by open competition between providers, where
   the self-interest of practice owners and clinicians will bring price and
   quality into an acceptable balance. In this paradigm, the bioethical
   principle of justice is replaced by a market-driven model whereby
   patients may access only that for which they can pay. Welie uses the
   principle of justice to argue between the separation of medical care and
   non-medical care. He states that it would be unjust for a society not to
   offer equal access to dental hygiene, but that it would not be
   considered unjust for society to have unequal access to an intervention
   such as laser-eye surgery. This is a valid argument in so far as the
   wearing of eyeglasses is not a point of stigma within society;
   considering the popularity of non-prescription eyewear, this is
   reasonably obvious. However, Welie does not compare like with like. It
   can be reasonably well established that dental appearance has
   significant influence over how an individual is perceived in society.
   Moeller et al. noted a considerably higher public awareness of an
   association between social deprivation and poor oral health in
   comparison to other health conditions such as cancer, diabetes and
   depression. This is believed to lead to greater possibility of
   association between dental appearance and assumptions being made about
   socioeconomic status, with the potential for discrimination on this
   basis. Bedos et al. found that those receiving social assistance, who
   are disproportionately afflicted with poor oral health and associated
   poor dental aesthetics, place great value upon the appearance of their
   teeth. The participants complained about decline in dental appearance
   and the associated, negative impacts this had upon their self-esteem,
   social interactions and whether they could secure gainful employment.
   Reports of hopelessness relating to this situation lead to a preference
   in extractions and opting for complete dentures. This is supported by
   Khalid and Quinonez, who state that those without conformity to the
   expectation of dental appearance celebrated and enjoyed by the social
   elite, are assigned negative personality and character traits. Whilst
   Welie might be justified in describing a lack of outrage relating to
   unequal access to non-medical interventions, the concept of ``cosmetic
   justice{''} in relation to dentistry holds merit given the huge impacts
   that effect those who suffer a decline in dental aesthetics.
   Despite this, the NHS in the United Kingdom states that; ``NHS dental
   treatment does not include cosmetic treatments that are not clinically
   necessary horizontal ellipsis Cosmetic treatments horizontal ellipsis
   are used to improve the appearance of your teeth and make them look more
   attractive, and are only available privately.{''} Whilst the boundaries
   of a public health system need to be realistic, an artificial
   demarcation between cosmetic and therapeutic treatments assumes that the
   differentiation between these two categories within dentistry is
   obvious, if it exists at all. To remain with the example of the NHS,
   cosmetic operations such as the provision of breast implants have been
   carried out on the justification of improving mental wellbeing and human
   flourishing. In would seem incongruous for cosmetic dental treatment to
   be treated differently. The reality of the situation is that often the
   demarcation between cosmetic and traditional treatment becomes
   indistinguishable; providing a patient with a set of dentures to enable
   them to chew or provision of a crown to aid structural integrity may
   also have the simultaneous effect of enhancing appearance. One imagines
   that few dental professionals would argue that the cosmetic improvement
   was merely a by-product of restoring function. This again shows that the
   separation of oral health and aesthetics is indeed artificial and that
   the two concepts are frequently intertwined to the point of being
   inseparable. In this way, where public dental services are provided,
   whilst policy directions may state that cosmetic treatment is not
   available, this is not a position that is practically enforceable; only
   purely cosmetic procedures are able to be realistically excluded. Whilst
   cosmetic dentistry is not in itself damaging to professional ethics and
   professionalism, if undertaken in a manner that is consumer-driven,
   converted into a commodity, it has the potential, as well as the rest of
   dentistry and medicine, to radically change the dynamics of the social
   contract. Commercial strategies such as advertising typically walk a
   fine line between scaring patients, through directing attention towards
   possible deficits, and offering pleasure or satisfaction. Advertising
   has the potential to damage patient autonomy when used in a manner that
   is manipulative and this practice should be universally regulated and
   condemned. Dental appearance is a fundamental factor in how individuals
   are perceived and judged by society. The dismissal of cosmetic dentistry
   as part of the legitimate practice of dentistry is illogical; the
   separation should instead be between cosmetic dentistry and
   commercialism. The tradition of surveillance in dentistry is long
   established. Nettleton describes the dentist as a ``tooth-judge,{''}
   stating; ``The duty of the dentist was not just to invade the mouth but
   to monitor and regulate and thus to contribute to the policing of
   bodies.{''} The preventative focus of dentistry is testament to the
   profession's role in observing and measuring the mouth. Nettleton's
   description of the dentist-as-judge places the dental professional in a
   position to exercise disciplinary power. Foucaldian accounts of power
   allow description of three instruments through which a dental
   professional may exercise disciplinary power; firstly, through
   hierarchical observation; secondly by utilising normalising judgement;
   and thirdly, combining the first two instruments in the process of the
   clinical examination.
   Through the process of hierarchical observation, subjects are placed
   into a state of perceived continuous surveillance, regardless of whether
   this surveillance is continuously in operation. Normalising judgement
   involves the evaluation and comparison of individual patients to
   established norms. This allows the dentist to declare patients to be
   either ``normal{''} or ``abnormal{''} and conformity assured through
   correction. The examination is the result of the combination of
   hierarchical observation and normalising judgement. This instrument
   permits, ``the subjection of those who are perceived as objects and the
   objectification of those who are subjected horizontal ellipsis in this
   slender technique are to be found a whole domain of knowledge, a whole
   type of power.{''} Through the dental examination, each mouth could be
   scrutinised and if deviation from the norm detected, this can be
   corrected. The power of the dentist has traditionally been used to
   assert conformity to norms of absence of disease, for example, through
   the filling of carious teeth, or in the instruction of the proper manner
   to maintain a plaque free mouth. In the modern era, dentists have
   expanded their powers of disciplinary observation and the normalising
   gaze, through social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
   Advertising pages for dental practices on social media frequently use
   advertising to remind patients to maintain proper oral hygiene and
   attend regularly. This also extends to how teeth are depicted, and
   cosmetic procedures represented. The ideals and beliefs of the dental
   profession of the ideal mouth may be enforced through the normalising
   gaze, whereby patients may be subjected to the professionally-held norm
   of a well-aligned, white smile, in a mouth with lips of ideal
   proportion. The dental professional does not have to explicitly subject
   the patient to this norm; the patient is bombarded with messages within
   the practice environment, through promotional and educational materials.
   It would be wrong, as Khalid and Quinonez note well, to suggest that the
   dental profession is solely responsible for the setting of societal
   norms relating to what constitutes the ideal smile. It would be more
   appropriate to describe the dental profession as being an enabling
   factor to society's desire for a mouth that looks a certain way. The
   profession's disciplinary authority and expertise of what can be
   achieved, drives the notion of what a disciplined smile may be. It is
   through schools of professional theory that dentists are trained to
   exercise their powers of hierarchical observation. The establishment of
   the dental profession in the early 20th Century led to the
   legitimisation of the dentist as an authority in enforcing the norms of
   the ideal smile that are ultimately informed by society. The power of
   the profession comes from the stigma of poor oral health; ``They conform
   to norms not because they are afraid of the power itself, but because of
   the possibility of facing penalty, namely, negative stereotyping of
   individuals with `bad' teeth.{''} The practices of the dental profession
   in engaging in exploitative advertising, designed to induce perception
   of treatment need, and the complicity of professionals in
   consumption-focused practice (the relentlessness of consumerism) helps
   to enforced societal norms. Otto illustrates this well in telling the
   story of Mame Adjei, the winner of Miss Maryland in 2015.
   As part of her competition prize, she is awarded ten thousand dollars
   towards treatment at one of the award's sponsors; a cosmetic dentist.
   She tells of how Adjei sits in the dentist's waiting room, bombarded
   with images of other beauty pageant winners who have received treatment
   and professional messages such as; ``Like they say with the lottery, you
   gotta be in it to win it. You have to play the game. Life is hard enough
   and a bright, beautiful smile can help open doors and hearts.{''}
   Following her consultation, Adjei reports feeling more aware and
   critical of her teeth and decides to embark upon the treatment
   recommended to her. After this, Otto describes a person in conflict;
   Adjei has had the treatment she perceived she needed to progress in the
   pageant world but is also disturbed by the process; ``I'm like an art
   project horizontal ellipsis I don't think I needed it horizontal
   ellipsis I don't mind my little special things about me. Now my teeth
   look like everyone else's.{''} This is a stark example of the ``gaze{''}
   being applied to ideal norms of aesthetic beauty. The ``gaze{''} of the
   cosmetic dentist becomes manifest in the use of computerised or
   conventional technologies that show patients the predicted outcome of
   treatment. Programmes may alter patient's smiles digitally or through
   the ``diagnostic{''} wax-model of teeth produced by the dentist to show
   what might be realised through cosmetic intervention. Here the dentist
   specifies the parameters of how they will transform the smile. These
   processes can be likened to the whorls and lines of the cosmetic marker
   pen in surgical consultations. The specialised training and professional
   status of dentists, places them in a position of authority. This
   authority, combined with the culturally derived notions of ideal dental
   aesthetics, makes it difficult for dental professionals to be neutral
   participants in changing the appearance of the mouth. The dental
   profession could be seen to have a vested interest in not challenging
   prevailing social norms; after all, cosmetic dentistry will always offer
   dentists an alternative stream of income regardless of any decreasing
   prevalence of dental disease. It could be argued that the dental
   profession has a duty to contribute to the destigmatisation of
   alternative appearances, addressing the paradigm where individuals with
   facial and other deformity are disabled by the culture around them
   rather than any physical or functional impairment. Twine notes that
   there is a tendency to scoff at how foolish society was in the days of
   yesteryear to place any weight upon the pseudo-science of physiognomy,
   and yet how prevalent these ideas within society still remain. Through a
   collective addressing of this issue in dentistry, the profession may
   have the potential to alter prevailing cultural attitudes towards the
   ideal dental appearance, especially as teeth are an essential part of
   the physiognomic assessment that is often made of an individual's
   character and morality. Comment should be made on the fluidity of
   cultural preferences in dental appearance. Blackened teeth, that elicit
   stigma and assumptions of low socio-economic status and self-neglect in
   Western culture today, would have led to opposite conclusions of
   affluence in the 16th and 17th centuries. The cost of sugar in these
   periods meant that tooth decay was an affliction of the rich.
   Likewise, tooth blackening (as opposed to teeth whitening) was once
   considered to be an enhancement of beauty, partly favoured as it
   disguised the sharpness of canines which were associated with
   animalistic or evil tendencies. Within Japanese culture, there is a
   preference, in some, for ``yaeba{''}; a characteristic appearance where
   the canine teeth are prominent. It is believed that this prominence
   suggests a youthfulness and is considered to be attractive by many.
   Whilst many have their teeth aligned to conform to the Western
   preference of straight teeth, having orthodontics to pronounce canines
   is still relatively common. Across cultures, preferences in tooth
   appearance may contrast and the current preference for uniformity in
   alignment and enhanced brightness in Western culture may change in the
   future. In this discourse examining cosmetic dentistry, the problems of
   attempting to separate the practice of dental cosmetics, and treatments
   that may be categorised as treating dental disease and suffering, become
   evident. The insistence that cosmetic dentistry somehow sits outside of
   the professional purview of dentistry is untenable based upon both how
   oral health is defined, and the great value that society places on
   dental appearance. Instead, the distinction must be made between
   cosmetic dentistry and commercially-focused dentistry, where the
   practice and role of the dental professional changes to being one more
   similar to a facilitator of consumerist culture. Often, this is where
   tensions between cosmetic dentistry and notions of professionalism have
   arisen, the established and commonly-held belief being that
   commercialism and that aspect of dentistry are inextricably linked.
   Cosmetic dentistry has no moral value attached to it that makes it
   immediately objectionable to professional purpose. Where this becomes
   compromised is through the introduction of action of behalf of the
   profession that conflict with the effacement of self-interest, such as
   exploitative advertising, overtreatment or defacement of the
   dentist-patient relationship into one of commercial exchange. It can be
   concluded that cosmetic dentistry can deliver benefits to oral health
   and join the pantheon of professional dentistry, but only when the
   requirements of informed consent that preserve patient autonomy and
   resistance to commercial factors are observed. The ethics of care of the
   self and the concept of the dental gaze may be thought to be opposites
   of the same coin; patients should have the freedom to consume cosmetic
   dentistry in a manner which will develop personal growth and
   self-improvement. To refuse cosmetic dentistry as an ethical tool for
   this purpose would be to deny a bona fide instrument of
   self-cultivation. The converse in this relationship is the dominance and
   authority of the dental profession, with the dentist placed as the
   arbiter of the norms of dental appearance. Professional judgement is
   then developed into a sales-pitch to sell this normalised view of what
   dental appearance should be. In this, the dentist acts to validate and
   impose the socially determined parameters of what might be considered an
   ideal dental appearance. The findings of this study into the nature of
   cosmetic dentistry have implications for how treatment that is primarily
   aesthetic in nature may be judged by the profession, and by those that
   fund public dental services.
   The widening of the definition of dentistry to include cosmetic
   treatments may have unwelcome implications for the funding of dental
   treatments, but the consequences of poor dental appearance upon social
   status, employability and relationships cannot be forgotten. Alexander

   Definitions and Legitimacy: Self-Care Ethics and Concepts of Cosmesis in
   Dentistry Cosmetic Dentistry and Consumerism The Dental Gaze and
   Cosmetic Dentistry Conclusion Footnotes Cosmetic dentistry is a divisive
   discipline. Within discourses that raise questions of the purpose of the
   dental profession, cosmetic dentistry is frequently criticised on the
   basis of it being classified as a non-therapeutic intervention. This
   article re-evaluates this assertion through examination of ethics of
   care of the self, healthcare definitions and the social purpose of
   dentistry, finding the traditional position to be wanting in its
   conclusions. The slide of dentistry from a healthcare vocation towards
   being a predominantly business-focused interaction between clinician and
   consumer conflicts with traditional notions of dentistry as a
   profession. Whilst it is undeniable that cosmetic dental treatment
   particularly lends itself to the commercial paradigm, this is not
   exclusive to this area of professional practice. The cultural basis of
   dental appearance and the potential of the dental profession to exert
   coercive pressure upon the public to undergo treatment that is based
   upon social norms is discussed.
   This essay concludes that cosmetic dentistry is undeniably part of the
   professional purpose of 21st Century dentistry. However, the caveat that
   may be placed upon this, is that this status is conditional upon the
   professional conduct of dental practitioners remaining resilient to
   commercial practices not compatible with professional obligations.},

Title = {Simulation-based mastery learning compared to standard education for
   discussing diagnostic uncertainty with patients in the emergency
   department: a randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {Background Diagnostic uncertainty occurs frequently in emergency medical
   care, with more than one-third of patients leaving the emergency
   department (ED) without a clear diagnosis. Despite this frequency, ED
   providers are not adequately trained on how to discuss diagnostic
   uncertainty with these patients, who often leave the ED confused and
   concerned. To address this training need, we developed the Uncertainty
   Communication Education Module (UCEM) to teach physicians how to discuss
   diagnostic uncertainty. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the UCEM in improving physician communications. Methods
   The trial is a multicenter, two-arm randomized controlled trial designed
   to teach communication skills using simulation-based mastery learning
   (SBML). Resident emergency physicians from two training programs will be
   randomly assigned to immediate or delayed receipt of the two-part UCEM
   intervention after completing a baseline standardized patient encounter.
   The two UCEM components are: 1) a web-based interactive module, and 2) a
   smart-phone-based game. Both formats teach and reinforce communication
   skills for patient cases involving diagnostic uncertainty. Following
   baseline testing, participants in the immediate intervention arm will
   complete a remote deliberate practice session via a video platform and
   subsequently return for a second study visit to assess if they have
   achieved mastery. Participants in the delayed intervention arm will
   receive access to UCEM and remote deliberate practice after the second
   study visit. The primary outcome of interest is the proportion of
   residents in the immediate intervention arm who achieve mastery at the
   second study visit. Discussion Patients' understanding of the care they
   received has implications for care quality, safety, and patient
   satisfaction, especially when they are discharged without a definitive
   diagnosis. Developing a patient-centered diagnostic uncertainty
   communication strategy will improve safety of acute care discharges.
   Although use of SBML is a resource intensive educational approach, this
   trial has been deliberately designed to have a low-resource, scalable
   intervention that would allow for widespread dissemination and uptake.},

Title = {Herbopolis - A mobile serious game to educate players on herbal
   medicines},
Journal = {COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {68-79},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Use of herbal medicines is common. There is a need for
   education in this area. Mobile games are useful educational tools for
   motivating learning. A mobile game on herbal medicines can potentially
   enhance players' herb-related knowledge. Our objective was to develop a
   mobile game to motivate players to learn more about herbal medicines.
   Methods: Game development comprised of storyboarding, user interface
   design, database development, server development and distribution. A
   pilot usability study was conducted for the game prototype. Data was
   gathered through user registration, background data collection and a
   post-game survey containing a quiz on herbs encountered in the game.
   Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test and Spearman's correlation
   coefficient were used for data analysis.
   Results: ``Herbopolis{''} is an in-house developed mobile game of the
   simulation genre. Players are tasked to manage a city specializing in
   the production and sale of herbal products. Nineteen out of 24
   participants downloaded and played the game, and completed the post-game
   survey. Heuristic evaluations for usability, playability and educability
   were generally positive. Strong positive associations were observed
   between player level (r = 0.810, p < 0.001) and gameplay time (r =
   0.757, p < 0.001) with quiz scores. Female players scored higher in the
   quiz (p = .044), played for more days (p = .010) and attained higher
   levels (p = .010) than male players.
   Conclusion Players are motivated to learn about herb-related information
   through playing ``Herbopolis{''}. Our results support its use for
   improving knowledge on herbal medicines. Future game iterations to
   improve robustness and performance will likely to improve its reception
   and effectiveness in learning.},

   Adolescents},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH PROMOTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {491-501},
Abstract = {Purpose: Screen-based sedentary behavior (SSB) has been identified as
   risk factor for mental disorders in most of adolescents. However, there
   is little literature pertaining to the specific kinds of SSB and its
   connections with depressive symptoms in most of adolescents. In the
   present study, we are going to find out the connections between specific
   types of SSB and depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents. Methods: A
   cross-sectional data based on 996 study participants of middle school
   students in Guangdong Province. SSB was evaluated by distributing the
   questionnaire of Health Behavior in School-aged Children, while
   depressive symptoms were evaluated using Chinese version of Children???s
   Depressive symptoms Inventory (CDI). SSB was categorized into TV/movie
   time, video games time and other electronic devices-based time (e.g.,
   mobile phone, computer use). Generalized linear models was used to
   explore the connections between specific kinds of SSB and depressive
   symptoms. Results: After controlling for variables of sex, ethnicity,
   grade, residence, siblings, perceived family affluence, of sleep, other
   electronic devices-based time was positively correlated with depressive
   symptoms in Chinese adolescents (B = 0.557\%, 95\%CI: 0.187???0.926, p =
   0.003). This significant connection was also found in girls (B =
   0.728\%, 95\%CI: 0.230???1.225, p = 0.004) instead of boys (p > 0.05).
   The other types of SSB were not significantly in relation to depressive
   symptoms in adolescents regardless of sex. Conclusion: This study
   suggested that it might be effective in reducing or preventing
   depressive symptoms through limiting electronic devices-based time, like
   computer use or mobile phone use time. This strategy would be
   particularly useful in girls. Future studies should negate or replicate
   the research results by introducing more improved study design, which is
   beneficial to better understand the connections between SSB and
   depressive symptoms as well as then design more efficient interventions
   in adolescents.},

Title = {Putting ``mobile{''} into mathematics: Results of a randomised
   controlled trial},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {59},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There is an increasing use of mobile technologies in the classroom,
   particularly its use in supporting contextual learning, but comparative
   research on the effects of mobile learning in mathematics are few. The
   aim of this research was to examine student perceptions of using mobile
   technologies and their effect on mathematics achievement in a randomised
   controlled trial. Seventy-four Grade 5 and 6 students and three teachers
   participated in the study. Both groups participated in six weeks of
   active and collaborative learning activities on math. The experimental
   group used tablets to support them in their activities while the control
   group had similarly designed activities without the tablets. The tablets
   were observed to have facilitated constructivist learning activities as
   students moved in and out of different learning contexts. Most of the
   experimental group had positive evaluations but their end activity
   ratings were not significantly different from the control group. Gender
   differences were found in terms of how students perceived the mobile
   learning activities. There was no difference found in the groups'
   post-test achievement scores following an analysis of covariance with
   pre-test as covariate. For items relating to student misconception,
   students in the experimental group performed better. Overall, the study
   highlights that the success of a mobile learning intervention is
   dependent on various factors, such as student characteristics, stability
   of the technology and content compatibility. Implications for practice
   and future research are discussed.},

   Proof-of-Concept Study},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Serious games are gaining increasing importance in
   neurorehabilitation since they increase motivation and adherence to
   therapy, thereby potentially improving its outcome. The benefits of
   serious games, such as the possibility to implement adaptive feedback
   and the calculation of comparable performance measures, can be even
   further improved by using immersive virtual reality (iVR), allowing a
   more intuitive interaction with training devices and higher ecological
   validity. Objective: This study aimed to develop a visual search task
   embedded in a serious game setting for iVR, including self-adapting
   difficulty scaling, thus being able to adjust to the needs and ability
   levels of different groups of individuals. Methods: In a two-step
   process, a serious game in iVR (bird search task) was developed and
   tested in healthy young (n=21) and elderly (n=23) participants and in a
   group of patients with impaired visual exploration behavior (ie,
   patients with hemispatial neglect after right-hemispheric stroke; n=11).
   Usability, side effects, game experience, immersion, and presence of the
   iVR serious game were assessed by validated questionnaires. Moreover, in
   the group of stroke patients, the performance in the iVR serious game
   was also considered with respect to hemispatial neglect severity, as
   assessed by established objective hemispatial neglect measures. Results:
   In all 3 groups, reported usability of the iVR serious game was above
   4.5 (on a Likert scale with scores ranging from 1 to 5) and reported
   side effects were infrequent and of low intensity (below 1.5 on a Likert
   scale with scores ranging from 1 to 4). All 3 groups equally judged the
   iVR serious game as highly motivating and entertaining. Performance in
   the game (in terms of mean search time) showed a lateralized increase in
   search time in patients with hemispatial neglect that varied strongly as
   a function of objective hemispatial neglect severity. Conclusions: The
   developed iVR serious game, ``bird search task,{''} was a motivating,
   entertaining, and immersive task, which can, due to its adaptive
   difficulty scaling, adjust and be played by different populations with
   different levels of skills, including individuals with cognitive
   impairments. As a complementary finding, it seems that performance in
   the game is able to capture typical patterns of impaired visual
   exploration behavior in hemispatial neglect, as there is a high
   correlation between performance and neglect severity as assessed with a
   cancellation task.},

Abstract = {The explosive growth of Internet of things (IoT) devices has promoted
   the prosperity of virtual reality applications, which can be realized by
   service offloading with the assistance of pervasive edge computing (PEC)
   platforms. However, owing to the limited computational and communication
   resources of PEC systems, it is necessary to design a novel resource
   management algorithm. In this study, we adopt cooperative bargaining
   theory to design our PEC resource allocation scheme. According to the
   concept of unification bargaining solution, different bargaining ideas
   are reciprocally combined to provide a fair-efficient solution. By
   coordinating network agents, we can leverage mutual consensus and
   approximate a well-balanced system performance among conflicting
   requirements. It is essential to explore the relevant trade-off between
   efficiency and fairness. To effectively share the PEC resources, the
   main novelty of our approach is its adaptability and flexibility to
   respond dynamic PEC system environments. Finally, extensive simulations
   are carried out, and the numerical results demonstrate that our unified
   bargaining method can obtain desirable features while maximizing the
   offloading service performance by comparing the existing
   state-of-the-art PEC control protocols.},

Abstract = {Kinect, which is useful as a multimodal input device, offers multiple
   features such as voice recognition, facial tracking, object recognition,
   and gesture recognition. Games with such human-centred, interactive
   interfaces create an environment that bridges between artificial and
   natural cognitive capabilities, enabling them to work together more
   efficiently. This study specifically examines a usability evaluation
   method that uses Kansei engineering knowledge to identify and remedy
   difficulties related to user interface development. As a practical
   application of the suggested evaluation method, we used a particular
   serious game, ``The Glider,{''} a prototype developed by Serious Games
   Finland. It exploits Kinect as its game controller. Serious games are
   usually aimed at promoting specific effects that can be achieved through
   playing the game. However, such effects can also present tradeoffs in
   terms of usability. Controlling motions in ``The Glider{''} has been
   developed in close cooperation with medical doctors, physiotherapists,
   and patients in terms of well-being and light exercise. However,
   modulating the difficulty balance and usability of the game is also a
   very important aspect of game development. As described in this paper,
   our goal is to evaluate the control motion of the game from a usability
   perspective. Evaluation consists of state and appearance observations
   conducted with 12 Japanese subjects. Observed data were tagged into
   several categories to quantize their behaviours and speeches, and were
   analysed using both cognitive bias evaluation and statistical
   evaluation. Results show that difficulties for subjects in control
   motions of the game were curved out, which is a key to balancing
   usability and difficulty while maintaining the genuine purpose of the
   serious game.},

Abstract = {Intercultural competence (IC) is a key competence in individuals' life.
   Educational programs carried out to date have been motivated by the
   presence of culturally diverse students. This situation calls for
   programs to be implemented in low cultural diversity contexts,
   considering its repercussion on all students.
   This study aimed to explore the impact of a Sport Education Model
   (SEM)-based program about games from around the world on seventh-grade
   students' intercultural competence and friendship goals. A
   quasi-experimental control group design (pre-test, post-test, and
   retention test measures) was carried out. The experimental group (EG)
   followed a SEM-based program (18 sessions) about games from around the
   world, whilst the control group (CG) was not exposed to any specific
   treatment, continuing with its ordinary syllabus. Data were collected
   from questionnaires, interviews and field notes.
   EG obtained significant improvements on reward, help, intercultural
   understanding and friendship-approach goals; whereas CG had significant
   diminishment on both intercultural sensitivity and understanding, as
   well as on friendship goals. Qualitative results conveyed: (a) an
   approach to new cultural realities; (b) how the teaching content led to
   cultural reflection; (c) how students created new relationships; (d)
   greater collaborative relationships; (e) how the model helped to
   mitigate negative behaviours; and (f) how the intervention provided
   students with greater opportunities for participation. Games from around
   the world are shown to be a suitable content for developing IC,
   suggesting the need for expanding evidence about possible effects of new
   teaching contents when conjugated with SEM.},

Abstract = {Serious games for safety education (SGSE) are a novel tool for preparing
   people to prevent and/or handle risky situations. Although several SGSE
   have been developed, design and evaluation methods for SGSE need to be
   better grounded in and guided by safety-relevant psychological theories.
   In particular, this paper focuses on threat appeals and the assessment
   of variables, such as safety locus of control, that influence human
   behavior in real risky situations. It illustrates how we took into
   account such models in the design and evaluation of ``Learn to
   Brace{''}, a first-of-its-kind serious game that deals with a major
   problem in aviation safety, i.e. the scarce effectiveness of the safety
   cards used by airlines. The study considered a sample of 48 users: half
   of them received instructions about the brace position through the
   serious game, the other half through a traditional safety card
   pictorial. Results showed that the serious game was much more effective
   than the traditional instructions both in terms of learning and of

Title = {A Robust Camera-Based Interface for Mobile Entertainment},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Camera-based interfaces in mobile devices are starting to be used in
   games and apps, but few works have evaluated them in terms of usability
   or user perception. Due to the changing nature of mobile contexts, this
   evaluation requires extensive studies to consider the full spectrum of
   potential users and contexts. However, previous works usually evaluate
   these interfaces in controlled environments such as laboratory
   conditions, therefore, the findings cannot be generalized to real users
   and real contexts. In this work, we present a robust camera-based
   interface for mobile entertainment. The interface detects and tracks the
   user's head by processing the frames provided by the mobile device's
   front camera, and its position is then used to interact with the mobile
   apps. First, we evaluate the interface as a pointing device to study its
   accuracy, and different factors to configure such as the gain or the
   device's orientation, as well as the optimal target size for the
   interface. Second, we present an in the wild study to evaluate the usage
   and the user's perception when playing a game controlled by head motion.
   Finally, the game is published in an application store to make it
   available to a large number of potential users and contexts and we
   register usage data. Results show the feasibility of using this robust
   camera-based interface for mobile entertainment in different contexts
   and by different people.},

Title = {What influences college students to continue using business simulation
   games? The Taiwan experience},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {929-939},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Previous studies have pointed out that computer games could improve
   students' motivation to learn, but these studies have mostly targeted
   teachers or students in elementary and secondary education and are
   without user adoption models. Because business and management
   institutions in higher education have been increasingly using
   educational simulation games in recent years, factors influencing the
   continuing use of business simulation games by higher-education students
   are worth probing into. This research adopted the technology acceptance
   model, expectation confirmation theory, and agency theory as its
   theoretical base. Moreover, learning motivation and classroom climate
   from the perspective of learning, as well as perceived attractiveness
   and perceived playfulness from the perspective of playfulness and
   attractiveness were also added to the final research model. A total of
   185 valid student respondents in Taiwan's higher education who have used
   business simulation games in their classes participated in the survey.
   The results show that perceived playfulness and learning performance
   positively influence students' satisfaction, which further influence the
   intention to use computer simulation games. Furthermore, perceived ease
   of use and perceived attraction play a critical role in determining
   perceived playfulness. Perceived ease of use was also positively
   influenced by perceived attraction. The research results on the
   students' perspective provide a strong support for the teachers to adopt
   or continue using computer simulation games in classrooms. However, the
   agency theory failed to be sustained as a useful too{[} in motivating
   students' learning activities, which is worthy of further research. (C)

Title = {Architecting Intelligent Smart Serious Games for Healthcare
   Applications: A Technical Perspective},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The immune system of human beings plays a pivotal role in guarding
   against different types of diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
   people with weak immune systems were more likely to die. Regular
   physical activities and healthy food intake can significantly improve
   the immune system; however, people with a sedentary lifestyle and a busy
   job schedule find it challenging and tedious to maintain regularity.
   Different approaches have been used over the years to engage people in
   various physical activities and improve their mental and physical
   health. The concept of employing serious games (games whose primary
   purpose is not fun or entertainment, but a serious goal) to effectuate
   better results has become one of the popular choices among healthcare
   professionals and research communities. Internet of things (IoT) has
   enabled digital transformation with smart cities, smart infrastructure,
   and the fourth industrial revolution. There have been some relevant
   studies on the encouragement of serious games in healthcare in the past
   few years. However, few research studies encourage IoT-enabled serious
   games played with IoT devices (sensors and actuators) by making the game
   experience more ubiquitous and pervasive. Consequently, the adaptation
   of the IoT in serious games for healthcare applications is a massive gap
   despite its growing need in an era significantly affected by COVID-19.
   This paper discusses the possibilities of integrating serious games with
   IoT and discusses the standard architecture, core technologies, and
   possible challenges. Finally, we present a prototype architecture and
   its various components and a qualitative analysis with recent studies.},

Abstract = {During the last decade, interactive technology has entered mainstream
   society. Its many users also include children, even the youngest ones,
   who use the technology in different situations for both fun and
   learning. When designing technology for children, it is crucial to
   involve children in the process in order to arrive at an age-appropriate
   end product. In this study we describe the specific iterative process by
   which an interactive application was developed. This application is
   intended to facilitate young children's, three-to five years old,
   participation in healthcare situations. We also describe the specific
   contributions of the children, who tested the prototypes in a preschool,
   a primary health care clinic and an outpatient unit at a hospital,
   during the development process. The iterative phases enabled the
   children to be involved at different stages of the process and to
   evaluate modifications and improvements made after each prior iteration.
   The children contributed their own perspectives (the child's
   perspective) on the usability, content and graphic design of the
   application, substantially improving the software and resulting in an
   age-appropriate product. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   EFFECTS OF TRAITS ON FITNESS},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {890-895},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Social interactions have a powerful effect on the evolutionary process.
   Recent attempts to synthesize models of social selection with equations
   for indirect genetic effects (McGlothlin et al. 2010) provide a broad
   theoretical base from which to study selection and evolutionary response
   in the context of social interactions. However, this framework concludes
   that social selection will lead to evolution only if the traits carried
   by social partners are nonrandomly associated. I suggest this conclusion
   is incomplete, and that traits that do not covary between social
   partners can nevertheless lead to evolution via interactive effects on
   fitness. Such effects occur when there are functional interactions
   between traits, and as an example I use the interplay in water striders
   (Gerridae) between grasping appendages carried by males and spines by
   females. Functional interactive effects between traits can be
   incorporated into both the equations for social selection and the
   general model of social evolution proposed by McGlothlin et al. These
   expanded equations would accommodate adaptive coevolution in social
   interactions, integrate the quantitative genetic approach to social
   evolution with game theoretical approaches, and stimulate some new
   questions about the process of social evolution.},

Volume = {40},

Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {In the last two decades, there has been a growing body of new teaching
   methods that encourage students to be active participants in their own
   learning. One of these approaches is known as game-based learning (GBL).
   In social work education, GBL has only been seen in the last decade, and
   thus is relatively new. The aim of this study is to explore the use of
   GBL through mobile phone apps, and to examine its effectiveness in
   enhancing learning for social work students. This study was carried out
   using a quantitative research design and followed the model of a
   quasi-experimental study. A purposeful sample was used, namely 48 social
   work students registered in two sections of a course in Generalist
   Practice in Social Work. The experimental and control groups were
   compared both before and after the intervention, with the assessment
   based on the students' marks in the exams and on their scores for the
   scale that measured their perception of the effectiveness of the
   methodology. Although there was a strong similarity between the
   experimental and control groups before the GBL intervention, there was a
   significant difference between them after it, which indicates that
   digital GBL might have the potential to enhance learning in social work
   students.},

Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {108-128},
Abstract = {This paper presents a descriptive analysis of the opportunities provided
   by an innovative proposal with augmented reality, based on children's
   literature. The proposal, designed for infant education teachers'
   training, is built on the picture book Rosie's Walk. It is intended to
   promote an approach to children's literature -together with other
   contents- from an immersive, interactive and game-based approach. As it
   is a case study, a qualitative methodology is used. Three analysis
   dimensions are established: a) didactic, formulating its pedagogical
   design (contents, activities and resources); b) digital, mentioning the
   AR levels implemented, the interactive resources included, the stimuli
   provided and the spaces represented, and c) creative, describing the 3D
   model designed. The descriptive analysis of this proposal reveals its
   great educational potential, as it promotes the development of a global
   competence. It also favours the addressing of infant education contents,
   as well as the approaching to digital and augmented resources, and,
   especially, to literary texts from a playful perspective. For these
   reasons this proposal is a highly motivating resource, which can be
   considered a suitable model for future teachers. They can enrich other
   picture books with augmented reality in order to promote multiples
   literacies by means of integrating multiple languages, and to transform
   reading into an immersive and enriching activity.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of Apps using Mobile Criteria for Adolescent
   Pregnancy Prevention (mCAPP)},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Adolescents in the United States and globally represent a
   high-risk population for unintended pregnancy, which leads to high
   social, economic, and health costs. Access to smartphone apps is rapidly
   increasing among youth, but little is known about the strategies that
   apps employ to prevent pregnancy among adolescents and young adults.
   Further, there are no guidelines on best practices for adolescent and
   young adult pregnancy prevention through mobile apps.
   Objective: This review developed a preliminary evaluation framework for
   the assessment of mobile apps for adolescent and young adult pregnancy
   prevention and used this framework to assess available apps in the Apple
   App Store and Google Play that targeted adolescents and young adults
   with family planning and pregnancy prevention support.
   Methods: We developed an assessment rubric called Mobile Criteria for
   Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention (mCAPP) for data extraction using
   evidence-based and promising best practices from the literature. mCAPP
   comprises 4 domains: (1) app characteristics, (2) user interface
   features, (3) adolescent pregnancy prevention best practices, and (4)
   general sexual and reproductive health (SRH) features. For inclusion in
   the review, apps that advertised pregnancy prevention services and
   explicitly mentioned youth, were in English, and were free were
   systematically identified in the Apple App Store and Google Play in
   2015. Screening, data extraction, and 4 interrater reliability checks
   were conducted by 2 reviewers. Each app was assessed for 92 facets of
   the mCAPP checklist.
   Results: Our search returned 4043 app descriptions in the Apple App
   Store (462) and Google Play (3581). After screening for inclusion
   criteria, 22 unique apps were included in our analysis. Included apps
   targeted teens in primarily developed countries, and the most common
   user interface features were clinic and health service locators. While
   app strengths included provision of SRH education, description of modern
   contraceptives, and some use of evidence-based adolescent best
   practices, gaps remain in the implementation of the majority of
   adolescent best practices and user interface features. Of the 8 best
   practices for teen pregnancy prevention operationalized through mCAPP,
   the most commonly implemented best practice was the provision of
   information on how to use contraceptives to prevent pregnancy (15/22),
   followed by provision of accurate information on pregnancy risk of
   sexual behaviors (13/22); information on SRH communication, negotiation,
   or refusal skills (10/22); and the use of persuasive language around
   contraceptive use (9/22).
   Conclusions: The quality and scope of apps for adolescent pregnancy
   prevention varies, indicating that developers and researchers may need a
   supportive framework. mCAPP can help researchers and developers consider
   mobile-relevant evidence-based best practices for adolescent SRH as they
   develop teen pregnancy prevention apps. Given the novelty of the mobile
   approach, further research is needed on the impact of mCAPP criteria via
   mobile channels on adolescent health knowledge, behaviors, and outcomes.},

Title = {Design, development and deployment of a hand/wrist exoskeleton for
   home-based rehabilitation after stroke - SCRIPT project},
Journal = {ROBOTICA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {32},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {1331-1346},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Changes in world-wide population trends have provided new demands for
   new technologies in areas such as care and rehabilitation. Recent
   developments in the the field of robotics for neurorehabilitation have
   shown a range of evidence regarding usefulness of these technologies as
   a tool to augment traditional physiotherapy. Part of the appeal for
   these technologies is the possibility to place a rehabilitative tool in
   one's home, providing a chance for more frequent and accessible
   technologies for empowering individuals to be in charge of their
   therapy.
   Objective: this manuscript introduces the Supervised Care and
   Rehabilitation Involving Personal Tele-robotics (SCRIPT) project. The
   main goal is to demonstrate design and development steps involved in a
   complex intervention, while examining feasibility of using an
   instrumented orthotic device for home-based rehabilitation after stroke.
   Methods: the project uses a user-centred design methodology to develop a
   hand/wrist rehabilitation device for home-based therapy after stroke.
   The patient benefits from a dedicated user interface that allows them to
   receive feedback on exercise as well as communicating with the
   health-care professional. The health-care professional is able to use a
   dedicated interface to send/receive communications and remote-manage
   patient's exercise routine using provided performance benchmarks.
   Patients were involved in a feasibility study (n=23) and were instructed
   to use the device and its interactive games for 180 min per week, around
   30 min per day, for a period of 6 weeks, with a 2-months follow up. At
   the time of this study, only 12 of these patients have finished their 6
   weeks trial plus 2 months follow up evaluation.
   Results: with the ``use feasibility{''} as objective, our results
   indicate 2 patients dropping out due to technical difficulty or lack of
   personal interests to continue. Our frequency of use results indicate
   that on average, patients used the SCRIPT1 device around 14 min of
   self-administered therapy a day. The group average for the system
   usability scale was around 69\% supporting system usability.
   Conclusions: based on the preliminary results, it is evident that stroke
   patients were able to use the system in their homes. An average of 14
   min a day engagement mediated via three interactive games is promising,
   given the chronic stage of stroke. During the 2nd year of the project, 6
   additional games with more functional relevance in their interaction
   have been designed to allow for a more variant context for interaction
   with the system, thus hoping to positively influence the exercise
   duration. The system usability was tested and provided supporting
   evidence for this parameter. Additional improvements to the system are
   planned based on formative feedback throughout the project and during
   the evaluations. These include a new orthosis that allows a more active
   control of the amount of assistance and resistance provided, thus aiming
   to provide a more challenging interaction.},

Abstract = {Cheating in games has existed since the beginning of video games. The
   landscape of gaming and cheating has changed profoundly with its
   migration to the online environment. This study aims to investigate the
   unethical behavioral intention of online gamers. The Theory of Planned
   Behavior and Social Comparison Theory is used to develop a comprehensive
   framework to understand gamers' cheating intention. This study employs a
   quantitative approach to collect data from 404 gamers using a random
   sampling technique. Results show that attitude, subjective norms,
   perceived behavioral control, hedonic motivation, and benign envy
   influences gamers' online cheating intention. Online cheating intention
   was found to influence online cheating behavior positively. Looking at
   the moderating effect of ethical judgment, this study revealed that
   ethical judgment dampens the positive relationship between attitude,
   benign envy, and perceived behavioral control on gamers' online cheating
   intention. This study is the first to explore the impact of different
   types of envy on divergent gaming behavior. It contributes to the
   literature by generating insights into an under-researched area of

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a novel interactive
   game-based visual performance technique (IGVP) and conventional oral
   health educational (OHE) talk on plaque control, gingival health, and
   oral hygiene knowledge and practices in 12-15-year-old schoolchildren. A
   single-blinded randomized controlled trial was undertaken in a private
   primary school in Belagavi, Karnataka, India. A total of 100 children
   aged 12-15 years were randomly assigned to either a conventional OHE
   talk (control group, n = 50) or the IGVP technique (test group, n = 50),
   using a computer-generated table of random numbers. A self-designed,
   pre-validated closed-ended questionnaire was collected from both groups,
   followed by clinical examination carried out using gingival and plaque
   index, pre- and post-intervention, at three months follow-up. There was
   a significant reduction in the mean gingival score and plaque score in
   the test group after intervention, indicating a 58.7\% and 63.4\%
   reduction, when compared to the control group, which had a 2.8\% and
   0.7\% reduction, respectively (p < 0.001). The test group showed a
   significant increase in the percentage of knowledge gained (22.4\%),
   compared to control group (7.8\%). The IGVP technique proved to be more
   effective than a conventional OHE talk in the reduction of the plaque
   score, gingival score, and in the improvement of the knowledge of oral
   hygiene maintenance and its application.},

Abstract = {Health professionals are a concerning risk population because of the
   high prevalence of exposure to biological, especially during training
   that involves procedures implying direct contact with bodily fluids.
   Notwithstanding, the considerable advance of information and
   communication technologies (ICTs) during the last decades has provided
   with the divergence of new paths of research applied to training in the
   health field, allowing it integration in the field of biological risk
   prevention.
   The objectives of this study are: firstly, to estimate the level of
   knowledge about risk situations and the immediate response capacity of
   future professionals, prepare health professionals before different
   scenarios that can be presented in health care, and contribute to the
   appropriate decision making in possible scenarios. Secondly, to design
   and develop a mobile web application that, in a fast and ever-present
   manner, allows the healthcare professional, to have a quick response
   system that is clear and concise; and to evaluate by health students'
   and professionals' opinions the effectiveness of the technology
   developed.
   This study has been structured in two phases: first, to determine the
   degree of knowledge and compliance of biosecurity measures; and second,
   to perform a dual evaluation of the application.
   The survey of graduating students concerning practices has shown that
   the knowledge of risk prevention is adequate; meanwhile, a dynamic and
   efficient platform has been obtained, and its double assessment is
   satisfactory.
   It has been shown that the incidence of biological accidents is in the
   mean of the results of previous studies. An upgradeable web platform,
   ubiquitous and capable of being used in any electronic device available
   in the market, was obtained.},

Title = {Serious Game Platform as a Possibility for Home-Based Telerehabilitation
   for Individuals With Cerebral Palsy During COVID-19 Quarantine - A
   Cross-Sectional Pilot Study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Introduction: There is a need to maintain rehabilitation activities and
   motivate movement and physical activity during quarantine in individuals
   with Cerebral Palsy (CP).
   Objective: This paper sets out to evaluate the feasibility and potential
   benefits of using computer serious game in a non-immersive virtual
   reality (VR) implemented and evaluated completely remotely in
   participants with CP for Home-Based Telerehabilitation during the
   quarantine period for COVID-19.
   Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, a total of 44 individuals
   participated in this study between March and June 2020, 22 of which had
   CP (14 males and 8 females, mean age = 19 years, ranging between 11 and
   28 years) and 22 typically developing individuals, matched by age and
   sex to the individuals with CP. Participants practiced a coincident
   timing game(1) and we measured movement performance and physical
   activity intensity using the rating of perceived exertion Borg scale.
   Results: All participants were able to engage with the VR therapy
   remotely, reported enjoying sessions, and improved performance in some
   practice moments. The most important result in this cross-sectional
   study was the significant increasing in rating of perceived exertion
   (through Borg scale) in both groups during practice and with CP
   presenting a higher rating of perceived exertion.
   Conclusion: Children with CP enjoyed participating, were able to perform
   at the same level as their peers on certain activities and increased
   both their performance and physical activity intensity when using the
   game, supporting the use of serious games for this group for home
   therapy and interactive games.},

Abstract = {Knowledge is key to competitive advantage, and the social reach of
   knowledge can amplify its power in terms of organizational performance.
   Leveraging such amplification, social media applications are expected
   broadly to improve the performance of organizational work, which

   units of analysis. The technological intermediation of knowledge work
   within and among such social aggregations of people remains a complex
   endeavor, however. This pertains in particular to immersive, 3D
   environments supporting virtual social and game worlds. As with other
   social media applications, such virtual worlds can amplify knowledge
   broadly, but they also offer potential to approach the sensations of
   face-to-face (F2F) interaction in terms of presence, copresence,
   psychological engrossment, and affective experience. In this exploratory
   study, we employ both quantitative and qualitative research techniques
   to investigate how teamwork performed through virtual worlds can
   approach that accomplished via F2F interactions. This leads to important
   findings, insights, guidelines, and suggestions for expanded research as

Title = {Development of a Novel Home-Based Exergame With On-Body Feedback:
   Usability Study},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: With more than 1.4 billion adults worldwide classified as
   physically inactive, physical inactivity is a public health crisis
   leading to an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Motivating and
   engaging training strategies are needed to tackle this public health
   crisis. Studies have shown that exergames, games controlled by active
   body movements, are potentially usable, attractive, and effective tools
   for home-based training. The ExerCube (by Sphery Ltd) has been developed
   as a physically immersive and adaptive functional fitness game. The
   development of a home-based version of the ExerCube could increase
   accessibility, reduce barriers to exercise, and provide an attractive
   solution to improve physical and cognitive health.
   Objective: The aim was threefold: (1) to develop a usable home-based
   exergame system, (2) to evaluate the usability and training experience
   of the home-based exergame and its early-stage on-body feedback system,
   and (3) to identify avenues for further user-centered design iterations
   of the system.
   Methods: A total of 15 healthy participants (mean age 25, SD 3 years)
   completed 2 laboratory visits consisting of four 5-minute exergame
   sessions. In each session, the on-body feedback system provided a
   different feedback modality (auditory, haptic, and visual feedback) to
   the participant. Following the second visit, participants completed a
   range of assessments, including the System Usability Scale (SUS), the
   Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES), the Flow Short Scale (FSS),
   the Immersive Experience Questionnaire (IEQ), and a rating of perceived
   exertions (RPEs) both physically and cognitively. Participants answered
   questions regarding the on-body feedback system and completed a
   semistructured interview.
   Results: Usability was rated as acceptable, with a SUS score of 70.5 (SD
   12). The questionnaires revealed medium-to-high values for the training
   experience (FSS: 5.3, SD 1; PACES: 5.3, SD 1.1; IEQ: 4.7, SD 0.9.
   Physical (mean 4.8, SD 1.6) and cognitive (mean 3.9, SD 1.4) RPEs were
   moderate. Interviews about the on-body feedback system revealed that the
   majority of participants liked the haptic feedback and the combination
   of haptic and auditory feedback the best. Participants enjoyed the
   distinct perceptibility, processing, and integration of the exergame and
   its supportive and motivating effect. The visual feedback was perceived
   less positively by participants but was still classified as
   ``potentially{''} helpful. The auditory feedback was rated well but
   highlighted an area for further improvement. Participants enjoyed the
   training experience and described it as motivating, interactive,
   immersive, something new, interesting, self-explanatory, as well as
   physically and cognitively challenging. Moreover, 67\% (n=10) of the
   participants could imagine exercising at home and continuing to play the
   exergame in the future.
   Conclusions: The home-based exergame and its early-stage on-body
   feedback system were rated as usable and an enjoyable training
   experience by a young healthy population. Promising avenues emerged for
   future design iterations.},

Title = {Mobile Phone Apps for the Prevention of Unintended Pregnancy: A
   Systematic Review and Content Analysis},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {299-311},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Over 50\% of pregnancies in the United States are
   unintended, meaning that the pregnancy is mistimed, unplanned, or
   unwanted. Unintended pregnancy increases health risks for mother and
   child, leads to high economic costs for society, and increases social
   disparities. Mobile phone ownership is rapidly increasing, providing
   opportunities to reach at-risk populations with reproductive health
   information and tailored unintended pregnancy prevention interventions
   through mobile phone apps. However, apps that offer support for
   unintended pregnancy prevention remain unevaluated.
   Objective: To identify, describe, and evaluate mobile phone apps that
   purport to help users prevent unintended pregnancy.
   Methods: We conducted an extensive search of the Apple iTunes and
   Android Google Play stores for apps that explicitly included or
   advertised pregnancy prevention or decision-making support in the
   context of fertility information/tracking, birth control reminders,
   contraceptive information, pregnancy decision-making, abortion
   information or counseling, sexual communication/negotiation, and
   pregnancy tests. We excluded apps that targeted medical professionals or
   that cost more than US \$1.99. Eligible apps were downloaded and
   categorized by primary purpose. Data extraction was performed on a
   minimum of 143 attributes in 3 domains: (1) pregnancy prevention best
   practices, (2) contraceptive methods and clinical services, and (3) user
   interface. Apps were assigned points for their inclusion of features
   overall and for pregnancy prevention best practices and contraceptive
   information.
   Results: Our search identified 6805 app descriptions in iTunes and
   Google Play. Of these, 218 unique apps met inclusion criteria and were
   included in the review. Apps were grouped into 9 categories: fertility
   trackers (n=72), centers and resources (n=38), birth control reminders
   (n=35), general sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information (n=17),
   SRH information targeted specifically to young adults (YA) (n=16),
   contraceptive information (n=15), service or condom locators (n=12),
   pregnancy tests (n=10), and games (n=3). Twelve apps scored at least 50
   points (out of 94) for overall number of features and at least 15 points
   (out of 21) for contraceptive information and pregnancy prevention best
   practices. Overall, 41\% of apps did not mention any modern
   contraceptive methods and 23\% mentioned only 1 method. Of apps that did
   mention a modern contraceptive method, fewer than 50\% of these apps
   provided information on how to use it. YA SRH apps had the highest
   percentage of pregnancy prevention best practices in each app.
   Demographic and interface evaluation found that most apps (72\%) did not
   target any race and only 10\% explicitly targeted youth. Communication
   interface features were present in fewer than 50\% of apps.
   Conclusions: This review identified several useful, evidence-based apps
   that support the prevention of unintended pregnancy. However, most apps
   miss opportunities to provide users with valuable information,
   interactive decision aids, and evidence-based interventions for
   unintended pregnancy prevention. Further, some apps in this space may
   increase the likelihood of unintended pregnancy due to the low
   effectiveness of the contraceptive methods promoted.},

   Progress Towards the End Game},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {The new WHO Roadmap for Neglected Tropical Diseases targets the global
   elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem. To date,
   control strategies have focused on effective diagnostics, mass drug
   administration, complementary and integrative public health
   interventions. Non-mammalian intermediate hosts and other vertebrates
   promote transmission of schistosomiasis and have been utilized as
   experimental model systems. Experimental animal models that recapitulate
   schistosomiasis immunology, disease progression, and pathology observed
   in humans are important in testing and validation of control
   interventions. We discuss the pivotal value of these models in
   contributing to elimination of schistosomiasis. Treatment of
   schistosomiasis relies heavily on mass drug administration of
   praziquantel whose efficacy is comprised due to re-infections and
   experimental systems have revealed the inability to kill juvenile
   schistosomes. In terms of diagnosis, nonhuman primate models have
   demonstrated the low sensitivity of the gold standard Kato Katz smear
   technique. Antibody assays are valuable tools for evaluating efficacy of
   candidate vaccines, and sera from graded infection experiments are
   useful for evaluating diagnostic sensitivity of different targets.
   Lastly, the presence of Schistosomes can compromise the efficacy of
   vaccines to other infectious diseases and its elimination will benefit
   control programs of the other diseases. As the focus moves towards
   schistosomiasis elimination, it will be critical to integrate treatment,
   diagnostics, novel research tools such as sequencing, improved
   understanding of disease pathogenesis and utilization of experimental
   models to assist with evaluating performance of new approaches.},

Abstract = {Mobile-edge cloud computing is a new paradigm to provide cloud computing
   capabilities at the edge of pervasive radio access networks in close
   proximity to mobile users. In this paper, we first study the multi-user
   computation offloading problem for mobile-edge cloud computing in a
   multi-channel wireless interference environment. We show that it is
   NP-hard to compute a centralized optimal solution, and hence adopt a
   game theoretic approach for achieving efficient computation offloading
   in a distributed manner. We formulate the distributed computation
   offloading decision making problem among mobile device users as a
   multi-user computation offloading game. We analyze the structural
   property of the game and show that the game admits a Nash equilibrium
   and possesses the finite improvement property. We then design a
   distributed computation offloading algorithm that can achieve a Nash
   equilibrium, derive the upper bound of the convergence time, and
   quantify its efficiency ratio over the centralized optimal solutions in
   terms of two important performance metrics. We further extend our study
   to the scenario of multi-user computation offloading in the
   multi-channel wireless contention environment. Numerical results
   corroborate that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior computation
   offloading performance and scale well as the user size increases.},

Abstract = {Individuals with cognitive impairments are evaluated using clinically
   validated cognitive assessment tools, which need to be administered by
   trained therapists. This serves as a major barrier for frequent and
   longitudinal monitoring of patients' cognitive impairment level. We
   introduce Neuro-World, a set of six mobile games designed to challenge
   visuospatial short-term memory and selective attention, which allows one
   to self-administer the assessment of his/her cognitive impairment level.
   Game performance is analyzed to estimate a widely accepted clinical
   measure, the mini mental state examination (MMSE), which highlights the
   translational impact of the system in real-world settings. We collected
   game-specific performance data from 12 post-stroke patients at baseline
   and a three-month follow-up, which were used to train supervised machine
   learning models to estimate the corresponding MMSE scores. The results
   presented herein show that the proposed approach can estimate the MMSE
   scores with a normalized root mean square error of 5.75\%. We also
   validate the system's responsiveness to longitudinal changes in
   cognitive impairment level and demonstrate the system's positive
   usability in cognitively impaired individuals and their willingness to
   adhere to the longitudinal use. This study demonstrates that Neuro-world
   has great potential to be used to evaluate the cognitive impairment
   level and monitor its long-term change. This study enables new clinical
   and research opportunities for accurate, longitudinal assessment of
   cognitive function via mobile games.},

   the first 24 months of the Vlad and Niki YouTube channel in Spanish,
   from its opening in December 2018 until February 2021, the aim is to
   find out to what extent and how products of identifiable non-toy brands
   are shown in the content. The research shows the persistent presence of
   non-toy products, especially fashion items; food, beverages and sweets;
   and electronic products. Products whose appearance may be ethically
   questionable for encouraging bad eating habits or the generation of
   addictive behaviours in the field of video games have been detected.
   Despite the difficulties that case studies entail when it comes to
   generalising conclusions, the originality of this study lies in the fact
   that a global review of all product categories with identifiable brands
   has been carried out going beyond the most common analyses that focus on
   the presence of toys, fashion or food products on social networks aimed
   at children.},

Title = {An Affective Neuroscience Framework for the Molecular Study of Internet
   Addiction},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Internet addiction represents an emerging global health issue.
   Increasing efforts have been made to characterize risk factors for the
   development of Internet addiction and consequences of excessive Internet
   use. During the last years, classic research approaches from psychology
   considering personality variables as vulnerability factor, especially in
   conjunction with neuroscience approaches such as brain imaging, have led
   to coherent theoretical conceptualizations of Internet addiction.
   Although such conceptualizations can be valuable aid, the research field
   is currently lacking a comprehensive framework for determining
   brain-based and neurochemical markers of Internet addiction. The present
   work aims at providing a framework on the molecular level as a basis for
   future research on the neural and behavioral level, in order to
   facilitate a comprehensive neurobiological model of Internet addiction
   and its clinical symptomatology. To help establish such a molecular
   framework for the study of Internet addiction, we investigated in N =
   680 participants associations between individual differences in
   tendencies toward Internet addiction measured by the Generalized
   Problematic Internet Use Scale-2 (GPIUS-2) and individual differences in
   primary emotional systems as assessed by the Affective Neuroscience
   Personality Scales (ANPS). Regression analysis revealed that the ANPS
   scales FEAR and SADNESS were the ANPS scales most robustly positively
   linked to several (sub)scales of the GPIUS-2. Also the scales SEEKING.
   CARE and PLAY explain variance in some of the GPIUS-2 subscales. As
   such, these scales are negatively linked to the GPIUS-2 subscales. As
   the ANPS has been constructed on substantial available brain data
   including an extensive molecular body with respect to evolutionary
   highly conserved emotional circuitry in the ancient mammalian brain, the
   present study gives first ideas on putative molecular mechanisms
   underlying different facets of Internet addiction as derived from
   associations between tendencies toward Internet addiction and individual
   differences in primary emotional systems. For example, as SADNESS is
   linked to the overall GPIUS-2 score, and the neuropeptide oxytocin is
   known to downregulate SADNESS, it is conceivable that the neuropeptide
   might play a role in Internet addition on the molecular level. Our
   findings provide a theoretical framework potentially illuminating the
   molecular underpinnings of Internet addiction. Finally, we also present
   data on the ANPS and smartphone addiction at the end of the paper.
   Similar to the reported associations between the AN PS and the GPIUS-2,
   these correlations might provide an initial outline for a framework
   guiding future studies that aim to address the molecular basis of
   smartphone addiction.},

Abstract = {Learning through digital media is currently considered as a mixture of
   methodologies that aim to approach the reality of students to motivate
   them. Gamification emerges as one of the pedagogical methodologies on
   the rise in digital classrooms, but is it really practical? What are its

   specialty) that is taught at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,
   where gamified activities and alternatives to traditional master
   teaching have been introduced in a progressive way throughout three
   academic years (2016/17 to 2018/19). The results show that there is a
   negative correlation between the numerical scores of the different
   components of the evaluation and the marks obtained in the activities of
   gamification. It is surprising that the group less involved in the
   gamification obtained better academic results, although gamification
   improved the motivation and the valuations of the subject, due to the
   inclusion of more games in the course. This raises doubts on whether the
   positive effects of gamification on the climate of the classroom and on
   motivation are opposed to academic results.},

Title = {Mobile Classroom for Military Tactical Training in Cavalry Mission
   Planning},
Journal = {INGENIERIA SOLIDARIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {29},
Abstract = {Introduction: This article is the result of the research project
   entitled ``Mobile classroom for military tactical training in cavalry
   mission planning, development in the Cavalry school of the Colombian
   Army from 2010 to 2017{''}. Its purpose is to identify tools to improve
   the training process of military personnel.
   Problem: The training is carried out in a theoretical environment as
   there is currently no alternative means to training personnel in this
   field. The present investigation aims to improve the instruction of the
   army personal with their varying roles and ranks -officers,
   non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and enlisted soldiers-, when
   encountering individual and collective training.
   Objective: Evaluate the impact of the implementation of a mobile
   classroom equipped with simulation tools, as a strategy for the
   formation of the members of the Cavalry School.
   Methodology. Empirical study developed in 5 stages: (i) initial
   instruction, (ii) diagnostic test, (iii) diagnostic feedback, (iv)
   performance test and (v) performance evaluation. For this, the
   adaptation of a trailer, such as a mobile classroom, and the ARMA 3 game
   was used.
   Results: The use of the mobile classroom allowed for an increase in the
   number of trained people whilst reduced training times resulting in
   lower operating costs and greater sustainability.
   Conclusion: The implementation of the mobile classroom and the
   simulation system contributed to the development of skills and
   abilities, improved decision-making capacities, increased perceptual
   variation and improved coordination, communication and team
   decision-making.
   Originality: First mobile classroom for military training, with
   invention patent, 10-61804.
   Limitation: The investigation was carried out at the Cavalry School. The
   results can only be replicable in other military study centers.},

   professionals in health care and education. Initially, 336 professionals
   had obtained the game 12-18 months earlier. In addition, twelve
   professionals were interviewed individually. Results showed that the
   actual use of SeCZ TaLK was associated with a positive attitude towards
   discussing sexuality, a high perceived feasibility of the game, own
   motivation and skills, and correspondence with work routines. The
   presence of preconditions (such as time to play and staffing capacity),
   participant's recruitment for game sessions and the professional
   environment were non-significant factors. Professionals appreciated the
   board game SeCZ TaLK but actual use depended on own motivation and
   skills and correspondence with work routines. To enhance the use of the
   board game, management should prioritize discussing sexuality and

Abstract = {Background: Players may not acquire adequate levels of
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) when playing commercial
   video games. This study's goal was to evaluate the effects of an
   exercise bike video game played by using a mobile application-based
   exergame that was designed exclusively to promote participants' MVPA,
   with additional attention paid to this game's ability to promote greater
   situational interest.
   Methods: An experimental design was used with 163 students (aged 20.31
   +/- 1.30, 18-26 years, 61.3\% male), all of whom were randomly allocated
   into an experimental group and a control group. Physical activity (PA)
   levels were assessed with ActiGraph GT3X+ (ActiGraph Inc., Fort Walton
   Beach, FL, USA) accelerometers. The situational interest scale was used
   to evaluate students' situational interest in both groups. Multivariate
   analysis of variance was conducted to examine the differences between
   sedentary behavior, PA levels, and situational interest between groups.
   Regression analyses were also used, with the purpose being to evaluate
   the strength of the relationship between PA and situational interest.
   Results: Results revealed that the experimental group had higher degrees
   of sedentary behavior, light PA, total interest, instant enjoyment,
   exploration intention, attention demand, novelty, and challenge, whereas
   the control group received higher scores for MVPA (control 95.01\% vs.
   experimental group 89.94\%). Regression analysis indicated that instant
   enjoyment (beta = 0.49, p < 0.01), exploration intention (beta = 0.18, p
   < 0.05), and attention demand (beta = 0.17, p < 0.05) were positive
   predictors for total interest, explaining 43\% of its variance.
   Conclusion: A newly designed mobile application-based exergame played
   via an exercise bike may enhance situational interest and provide a
   decent level of PA for players. (C) 2017 Production and hosting by

Abstract = {A longstanding hypothesis is that individuals who exhibit large
   increases in blood pressure during psychological stress are at risk for
   atherosclerosis. We tested whether blood pressure changes during
   psychological stress predict subsequent coronary calcification (CaC) in
   young healthy adults. We evaluated 2816 healthy black and white women,
   20 to 35 years of age, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in
   Young Adults Study, who were not using medication for hypertension or
   diabetes in 1987 - 1988. Participants completed video game and star
   tracing tasks while their blood pressure was recorded. Thirteen years
   later ( 2000 - 2001), they completed computed tomography measures of
   CaC. Overall 9.3\% ( 261 of 2816) had CaC present at follow-up. Each 10
   mm Hg change in systolic blood pressure during the video game was
   associated with a 24\% increased odds of having CaC at follow-up
   (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.06 to 1.46; P = 0.008). This
   association persisted after adjustment for age, race, sex, education,
   smoking, alcohol, family history of myocardial infarction, smoking,
   daily alcohol consumption, body mass index, and resting or baseline
   blood pressure ( odds ratio, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.08 to 1.58; P = 0.006).
   Blood pressure changes during the star tracing task were not associated
   with subsequent CaC. Blood pressure changes during a video game
   predicted the presence of CaC 13 years later. To our knowledge, this is
   the first study that reports blood pressure reactivity to a stressor
   being related to calcification in the coronary arteries. Blood pressure
   reactivity may provide useful prognostic information about future risk
   beyond standard risk factors.},

Title = {Evaluation of Recombinase Polymerase Amplification assay for monitoring
   parasite load in patients with kala-azar and post kala-azar dermal
   leishmaniasis},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Author summaryVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar caused by the
   digenetic parasite Leishmania donovani is a fatal form of leishmaniasis,
   unless treated. In South Asia, approximately 10-20\% of apparently cured
   cases of VL develop a dermal sequela termed post kala-azar dermal
   leishmaniasis (PKDL). It presents with macular or papulonodular lesions
   that harbour Leishmania parasites. Importantly, these cases of PKDL in
   addition to asymptomatic and relapsed VL cases serve as mobile disease
   reservoirs and sustain disease transmission. In macular PKDL, that
   presently comprise over 50\% of cases, the diagnosis is particularly
   challenging as parasites are often not detectable by microscopy.
   Accordingly, development of strategies for molecular diagnosis is one of
   the major foci of the ongoing leishmaniasis elimination programme
   targeted for 2023, that aims to decrease the burden to <1/10,000 cases
   of VL at the block/zilla level. Serological tests have limited
   applicability when it is necessary to distinguish present from past
   infection of VL, and in cases of PKDL when the positivity maybe due to a
   past history of VL. An excellent option is the quantitative polymerase
   chain reaction (qPCR) but limitations for its wider field applicability
   include the high cost, technical expertise and time factor. Accordingly,
   an urgent need exists for availability of field applicable molecular
   tests. The RPA tested in this study could well be the desired
   game-changer as it provided accurate diagnosis of VL and PKDL, can be
   performed in a primary health centre, and demonstrated the potential to
   be a monitoring tool for parasite load after treatment, that eventually
   can accelerate achieving the end-goal of elimination of leishmaniasis.
   BackgroundThe potential reservoirs of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in
   South Asia include asymptomatic and relapsed cases of VL, along with
   patients with post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). Accordingly,
   accurate estimation of their parasite load is pivotal for ensuring
   disease elimination, presently targeted for 2023. Serological tests
   cannot accurately detect relapses and/or monitor treatment
   effectiveness, and therefore, parasite antigen/nucleic acid based
   detection assays remain the only viable option. An excellent option is
   the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) but the high cost,
   technical expertise and time involved precludes its wider acceptability.
   Accordingly, the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay
   operated in a mobile suitcase laboratory has emerged not simply as a
   diagnostic tool for leishmaniasis but also to monitor the disease
   burden. Methodology/Principal findingsUsing total genomic DNA isolated
   from peripheral blood of confirmed VL cases (n = 40) and lesional
   biopsies of PKDL cases (n = 64), the kinetoplast-DNA based qPCR and RPA
   assay was performed and parasite load expressed as Cycle threshold (Ct)
   and Time threshold (Tt) respectively. Using qPCR as the gold standard,
   the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of RPA in naive cases of VL
   and PKDL was reiterated. To assess the prognostic potential of the RPA,
   samples were analyzed immediately at the end of treatment or >= 6 months
   following completion of treatment. In cases of VL, the RPA assay in
   terms of cure and detection of a relapse case showed 100\% concordance
   with qPCR. In PKDL following completion of treatment, the overall
   detection concordance between RPA and qPCR was 92.7\% (38/41). At the
   end of treatment for PKDL, 7 cases remained qPCR positive, whereas RPA
   was positive in only 4/7 cases, perhaps attributable to their low
   parasite load. Conclusions/SignificanceThis study endorsed the potential
   of RPA to evolve as a field applicable, molecular tool for monitoring
   parasite load, possibly at a point of care level and is worthy of
   consideration in resource limited settings.},

Title = {Physiological Responses and User Feedback on a Gameful Breathing
   Training App: Within-Subject Experiment},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Slow-paced breathing training (6 breaths per minute {[}BPM])
   improves physiological and psychological well-being by inducing
   relaxation characterized by increased heart rate variability (HRV).
   However, classic breathing training has a limited target group, and
   retention rates are very low. Although a gameful approach may help
   overcome these challenges, it is crucial to enable breathing training in
   a scalable context (eg, smartphone only) and ensure that they remain
   effective. However, despite the health benefits, no validated mobile
   gameful breathing training featuring a biofeedback component based on
   breathing seems to exist.
   Objective: This study aims to describe the design choices and their
   implementation in a concrete mobile gameful breathing training app.
   Furthermore, it aims to deliver an initial validation of the efficacy of
   the resulting app.
   Methods: Previous work was used to derive informed design choices,
   which, in turn, were applied to build the gameful breathing training app
   Breeze. In a pretest (n=3), design weaknesses in Breeze were identified,
   and Breeze was adjusted accordingly. The app was then evaluated in a
   pilot study (n=16). To ascertain that the effectiveness was maintained,
   recordings of breathing rates and HRV-derived measures (eg, root mean
   square of the successive differences {[}RMSSDs]) were collected. We
   compared 3 stages: baseline, standard breathing training deployed on a
   smartphone, and Breeze.
   Results: Overall, 5 design choices were made: use of cool colors,
   natural settings, tightly incorporated game elements, game mechanics
   reflecting physiological measures, and a light narrative and progression
   model. Breeze was effective, as it resulted in a slow-paced breathing
   rate of 6 BPM, which, in turn, resulted in significantly increased HRV
   measures compared with baseline (P<.001 for RMSSD). In general, the app
   was perceived positively by the participants. However, some criticized
   the somewhat weaker clarity of the breathing instructions when compared
   with a standard breathing training app.
   Conclusions: The implemented breathing training app Breeze maintained
   its efficacy despite the use of game elements. Moreover, the app was
   positively perceived by participants although there was room for
   improvement.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the effects of and countermeasures against
   adversarial behavior in network resource allocation mechanisms such as
   auctions and pricing schemes. It models the heterogeneous behavior of
   users, which ranges from altruistic to selfish and to malicious, within
   the analytical framework of game theory. A mechanism design approach is
   adopted to quantify the effect of adversarial behavior, which ranges
   from extreme selfishness to destructive maliciousness. First, the
   well-known result on the Vicrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism losing its
   efficiency property in the presence of malicious users is extended to
   the case of divisible resource allocation to motivate the need to
   quantify the effect of malicious behavior. Then, the Price of Malice of
   the VCG mechanism and of some other network mechanisms are derived. In
   this context, the dynamics and convergence properties of an iterative
   distributed pricing algorithm are analyzed. The resistance of a
   mechanism to collusions is investigated next, and the effect of
   collusion of some malicious users is quantified. Subsequently, the
   assumption that the malicious user has information about the utility
   function of selfish users is relaxed, and a regression-based iterative
   learning scheme is presented and applied to both pricing and auction
   mechanisms. Differentiated pricing as a method to counter adversarial
   behaviors is proposed and briefly discussed. The results obtained are
   illustrated with numerical examples and simulations.},

Abstract = {Mobile serious games are very important tools for self-learning,
   training, and edutainment. They can be used to improve the children's
   learning skills to grasp new concepts rapidly in an enjoyable manner.
   Fun, motivation, and engagement are the most important features in
   designing attractive serious games. Therefore, designers should always
   find the best strategies and techniques to keep children playing the
   game with motivation and enthusiasm. The process is very long and
   requires different expertise from all the stakeholders. Arcade games are
   the most played games for fun and amusement in the last decades. Their
   approach is based on simplicity, easiness, repetitiveness, and soft
   challenges. The players of arcade games need only to improve their
   scores in every episode and avoid frustration and hard challenges as in
   other games. Hence, this arcade-based approach can be used in designing
   attractive serious games for young children and adolescents. We propose
   in this research a new serious game for diabetic children to teach them
   about the disease in a very easy manner. The game uses the arcade
   approach coupled with useful information about diabetes where the
   children discover them incrementally during the play. The longer time
   the child spends on the game, the most she/he can learn and enhance
   her/his knowledge on the disease. The game success came from its design
   and implementation with the presence of diabetes children, advisors, and
   nutritionists. We compare the game with the well-known DEX pet-based
   game for diabetes awareness on different aspects including user
   experience, usability, and learning outcomes. The study is conducted on
   twenty children from a diabetes camp who accepted voluntarily to
   participate in this research. We evaluate their educational aspects,
   using an improved version of the MEEGA+ model. We demonstrate the
   importance of the proposed game in enhancing the children knowledge on
   diabetes and adopt a new healthy lifestyle.},

Abstract = {Purpose In the complex ecosystem of mobile applications multiple factors
   have been used to explain users' behavior, without though focusing on
   how different combinations of variables may affect user behavior. The
   purpose of this paper is to show how price value, game content quality,
   positive and negative emotions, gender and gameplay time interact with
   each other to predict high intention to download mobile games.
   Design/methodology/approach Building on complexity theory, the authors
   present a conceptual model followed by research propositions. The
   propositions are empirically validated through configurational analysis,
   employing fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on 531
   active users of mobile games.
   Findings Findings identify ten solutions that explain high intention to
   download mobile games. Alternative paths are identified depending on the
   gender and the time users spend playing mobiles games. The authors
   highlight the role of price value and game content quality, as well as
   that of positive emotions, which are always core factors when present.
   Originality/value To identify complex interactions among the variables
   of interest, fsQCA is employed, differentiating from traditional studies
   using variance-based methods, leading to multiple solutions explaining
   the same outcome. None of the variables explains the intention to
   download on its own, but only when they combine with each other. The
   authors extend existing knowledge on how price value, game content
   quality, emotions, gender and gameplay time combine to lead to high
   intention to download mobile games; and present a methodology for how to
   bridge complexity theory with fsQCA, improving our understanding of
   intention to adopt mobile applications.},

Abstract = {Ecological systems are complex assemblies of large numbers of
   individuals, interacting competitively under multifaceted environmental
   conditions. Recent studies using microbial laboratory communities have
   revealed some of the self-organization principles underneath the
   complexity of these systems. A major role of the inherent stochasticity
   of its dynamics and the spatial segregation of different interacting
   species into distinct patterns has thereby been established. It ensures
   the viability of microbial colonies by allowing for species diversity,
   cooperative behavior and other kinds of ``social{''} behavior. A
   synthesis of evolutionary game theory, nonlinear dynamics, and the
   theory of stochastic processes provides the mathematical tools and a
   conceptual framework for a deeper understanding of these ecological
   systems. We give an introduction into the modern formulation of these
   theories and illustrate their effectiveness focussing on selected
   examples of microbial systems. Intrinsic fluctuations, stemming from the
   discreteness of individuals, are ubiquitous, and can have an important
   impact on the stability of ecosystems. In the absence of speciation,
   extinction of species is unavoidable. It may, however, take very long
   times. We provide a general concept for defining survival and extinction
   on ecological time-scales. Spatial degrees of freedom come with a
   certain mobility of individuals. When the latter is sufficiently high,
   bacterial community structures can be understood through mapping
   individual-based models, in a continuum approach, onto stochastic
   partial differential equations. These allow progress using methods of
   nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcation analysis and invariant manifolds.
   We conclude with a perspective on the current challenges in quantifying
   bacterial pattern formation, and how this might have an impact on
   fundamental research in non-equilibrium physics. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {To Each Stress Its Own Screen: A Cross-Sectional Survey of the Patterns
   of Stress and Various Screen Uses in Relation to Self-Admitted Screen
   Addiction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},

Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {Background: The relationship between stress and screen addiction is
   often studied by exploring a single aspect of screen-related behavior in
   terms of maladaptive dependency or the risks associated with the
   content. Generally, little attention is given to the pattern of using
   different screens for different types of stressors, and variations
   arising from the subjective perception of stress and screen addiction
   are often neglected. Given that both addiction and stress are complex
   and multidimensional factors, we performed a multivariate analysis of
   the link between individual's subjective perceptions of screen
   addiction, various types of stress, and the pattern of screen usage.
   Objective: Using the media-repertoires framework to study usage
   patterns, we explored (1) the relation between subjective and
   quantitative assessments of stress and screen addiction; and (2)
   differences in stress types in relation to subjective screen addiction
   and different types of needs for screens. We hypothesized that
   interindividual heterogeneity in screen-related behavior would reflect
   coping differences in dealing with different stressors.
   Methods: A multifactorial Web-based survey was conducted to gather data
   about screen-related behaviors (such as screen time, internet addiction,
   and salience of different types of screens and related activities), and
   different sources of stress (emotional states, perceptual risks, health
   problems, and general life domain satisfaction). We performed group
   comparisons based on whether participants reported themselves as
   addicted to internet and games (Al) or not (A0), and whether they had
   experienced a major life stress (S1) or not (S0).
   Results: Complete responses were obtained in 459 out of 654 survey
   responders, with the majority in the S1A0 (44.6\%, 205/459) group,
   followed by S0A0 (25.9\%, 119/459), S1A1 (19.8\%, 91/459), and S0A1
   (9.5\%, 44/459). The S1A1 group was significantly different from S0A0 in
   all types of stress, internet overuse, and screen time (P<.001). Groups
   did not differ in rating screens important for short message service
   (SMS) or mail, searching information, shopping, and following the news,
   but a greater majority of A1 depended on screens for entertainment
   (chi(2)(3) =20.5; P<.001), gaming (chi(2)(3) =35.6; P<.001), and social
   networking (chi(2)(3) =26.5; P<.001). Those who depended on screens for
   entertainment and social networking had up to 19\% more emotional stress
   and up to 14\% more perceptual stress. In contrast, those who relied on
   screens for work and professional networking had up to 10\% higher
   levels of life satisfaction. Regression models including age, gender,
   and 4 stress types explained less than 30\% of variation in internet use
   and less than 24\% of the likelihood of being screen addicted.
   Conclusions: We showed a robust but heterogeneous link between screen
   dependency and emotional and perceptual stressors that shift the pattern
   of screen usage toward entertainment and social networking. Our findings
   underline the potential of using ludic and interactive apps for
   intervention against stress.},

Title = {A stratified decision-making model for long-term planning: Application
   in flood risk management in Scotland},
Journal = {OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {116},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In a standard decision-making model for a game of chance, the best
   strategy is chosen based on the current state of the system under
   various conditions. There is however a shortcoming of this standard
   model, in that it can be applicable only for short-term decision-making
   periods. This is primarily due to not evaluating the dynamic
   characteristics and changes in status of the system and the outcomes of
   nature towards an a priori target or ideal state, which can occur in
   longer periods. Thus, in this study, a decisionmaking model based on the
   concept of stratification (CST), game theory and shared socio-economic
   pathway (SSP) is developed and its applicability to disaster management
   is shown. The game of chance and CST have been integrated to incorporate
   the dynamic nature of the decision environment for long-term disaster
   risk planning, while accounting for various states of the system and an
   ideal state. Furthermore, an interactive web application with dynamic
   user interface is built based on the proposed model to enable decision
   makers to identify the best choices in their model by a predictive
   approach. The Monte Carlo simulation is applied to experimentally
   validate the proposed model. Then, it is demonstrated how this
   methodology can suitably be applied to obtain ad hoc models, solutions,
   and analysis in the strategic decision-making process of flooding risk
   strategy evaluation. The model's applicability is shown in an uncertain
   real-world decision-making context, considering dynamic nature of
   socio-economic situations and flooding hazards in the Highland and
   Argyll Local Plan District in Scotland. The empirical results show that
   flood forecasting and awareness raising are the two most beneficial
   mitigation strategies in the region followed by emergency
   plans/response, planning policies, maintenance , and self help . (c)

Title = {An Evaluation of Targeting Accuracy in Immersive First-Person Shooters
   Comparing Different Tracking Approaches and Mapping Models},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1086-1104},
Abstract = {Immersive Virtual Environments typically rely on a tracking system that
   captures the position and orientation of the head and hands of the
   cyber-user. Tracking devices, however, are usually quite expensive and
   require a lot of free space around the user, preventing them from being
   used for gaming at home. In contrast with these expensive capture
   systems, the use of inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) to
   register orientation is spreading everywhere, finding them in different
   control devices at affordable prices, such as the Nintendo Wiimote. With
   a control like this, the player can aim at and shoot the enemies like
   holding a real weapon. However, the player cannot turn the head to
   observe the world around because the PC monitor or TV remains in its
   place. Head-mounted displays, such as the Oculus Rift, with a
   head-tracker integrated in it, allows the player to look around the
   virtual world. Even if the game does not support the head-tracker, it
   can still be used if the sensor driver emulates the mouse, so it can
   control the player's view. However, the point of view is typically
   coupled with the weapon in first-person shooting (FPS) games, and the
   user gets rapidly tired of using the neck muscles for aiming. In this
   paper, these two components -view and weapon-are decoupled to study the
   feasibility of an immersive FPS experience that avoids position data,
   relying solely on inertial sensors and the mapping models hereby
   introduced. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to describe the mapping
   models proposed and present the results of the experiment carried out
   that proves that this approach leads to similar or even better targeting
   accuracy, while delivering an engaging experience to the gamer.},

Abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the impact of using augmented reality,
   gamification, and serious games in computer science education. The study
   presents the development process of an educational mobile application,
   describes an experiment that was conducted and involved 117 higher
   education students, and analyzes the results of a 49-item paper-based
   questionnaire. In total, 8 research questions were explored. The results
   of the study revealed that several educational benefits can be yielded
   when integrating such applications in teaching and learning activities
   and actively involving students in the design and development process.
   In particular, the application was assessed as an effective learning
   tool that could enrich and improve the educational process and create
   interactive, inclusive, and student-centered learning environments. Its
   use led mostly to positive effects and experiences while maintaining the
   negative ones to a minimum and most students expressed positive
   emotions. Students were able to learn in a more enjoyable and
   interesting manner, and their motivation, engagement, self-efficacy, and
   immersion were greatly increased. Students' innate need for autonomy,
   competence, and relatedness was satisfactorily met and both their
   intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivations were triggered. They felt a
   sense of belonging and cultivated their social skills. The potential of
   the application to improve students' knowledge acquisition and academic
   achievements was also observed. The application also enabled students to
   improve their computational thinking and critical thinking skills.
   Therefore, the potential of combining augmented reality, gamification,
   and serious games to enhance students' cognitive and social-emotional
   development was highlighted.},

Abstract = {In mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), nodes are mobile in nature.
   Collaboration between mobile nodes is more significant in MANETs, which
   have as their greatest challenges vulnerabilities to various security
   attacks and an inability to operate securely while preserving its
   resources and performing secure routing among nodes. Therefore, it is
   essential to develop an effective secure routing protocol to protect the
   nodes from anonymous behaviors. Currently, game theory is a tool that
   analyzes, formulates and solves selfishness issues. It is seldom applied
   to detect malicious behavior in networks. It deals, instead, with the
   strategic and rational behavior of each node. In our study,we used the
   dynamic Bayesian signaling game to analyze the strategy profile for
   regular and malicious nodes. This game also revealed the best actions of
   individual strategies for each node. Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE)
   provides a prominent solution for signaling games to solve incomplete
   information by combining strategies and payoff of players that
   constitute equilibrium. Using PBE strategies of nodes are private
   information of regular and malicious nodes. Regular nodes should be
   cooperative during routing and update their payoff, while malicious
   nodes take sophisticated risks by evaluating their risk of being
   identified to decide when to decline. This approach minimizes the
   utility of malicious nodes and it motivates better cooperation between
   nodes by using the reputation system. Regular nodes monitor continuously
   to evaluate their neighbors using belief updating systems of the Bayes
   rule.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the technological revolution has changed the way we see
   reality and interact with it. Inevitably, education and didactic
   planning have also had to deal with new technologies. Indeed, the
   presence of digital tools has radically changed people's lives since
   childhood. Many educational realities have exploited this digital
   transformation to speed up and specialize learning, customizing study
   plans and type of software according to age groups. The activity of the
   Digital Education Lab is part of this context. It is a digital education
   school which uses the game software Minecraft Education Edition to teach
   its students the fundamental principles of computer science, geometry
   and mathematics. This article discusses learning key science concepts
   through game learning. The analysis carried out allows to see that
   students are facilitated in learning complex scientific concepts when
   these are shown through the game and can therefore be ``experienced{''}.
   The learning of 186 students aged between 8 and 10, who are generally at
   the first approaches to the digital world, has been evaluated. To
   evaluate the acquisition of knowledge through these innovative methods,
   at the end of the didactic course we have administered anonymous tests

Title = {Time Spent Gaming, Device Type, Addiction Scores, and Well-being of
   Adolescent English Gamers in the 2021 OxWell Survey: Latent Profile
   Analysis},
Journal = {JMIR PEDIATRICS AND PARENTING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Background: The shift in the last decades to screen-based and
   increasingly web-based gaming activity has raised concerns about its
   impact on the development of children and adolescents. Despite decades
   of research into gaming and related psychosocial effects, the question
   remains how best to identify what degree or context of gaming may be a
   cause for concern.
   Objective: This study aimed to classify adolescents into gamer profiles
   based on both gaming behaviors and well-being. Once we distinguished the
   different gamer profiles, we aimed to explore whether membership to a
   specific profile could be predicted based on a range of personal
   characteristics and experiences that could then help identify those at
   risk.
   Methods: We explored gaming and well-being in an adolescent school
   population (aged 12-18 years) in England as part of the 2021 OxWell
   student survey. Self-report measures of time spent playing games on
   computers or consoles, time spent playing games on mobile phones, the
   Game Addiction Scale, and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale
   were used to classify adolescent heavy gamers (playing games for at
   least 3.5 hours a day) using latent profile analysis. We used
   multinomial logistic regression analysis to predict the profile
   membership based on a range of personal characteristics and experiences.
   Results: In total, 12,725 participants answered the OxWell gaming
   questions. Almost one-third (3970/12,725, 31.2\%) indicated that they
   play games for at least 3.5 hours a day. The correlation between time
   spent playing video games overall and well-being was not significant
   (P=.41). The latent profile analysis distinguished 6 profiles of
   adolescent heavy gamers: adaptive computer gamers (1747/3970, 44\%);
   casual computer gamers (873/3970, 22\%); casual phone gamers (595/3970,
   15\%); unknown device gamers (476/3970, 12\%); maladaptive computer
   gamers (238/3970, 6\%); and maladaptive phone gamers (79/3970, 2\%). In
   comparison with adaptive computer gamers, maladaptive phone gamers were
   mostly female (odds ratio {[}OR] 0.08, 95\% CI 0.03-0.21) and were more
   likely to have experienced abuse or neglect (OR 3.18, 95\% CI
   1.34-7.55). Maladaptive computer gamers, who reported gaming both on
   their mobile phones and on the computer, were mostly male and more
   likely to report anxiety (OR 2.25, 95\% CI 1.23-4.12), aggressive
   behavior (OR 2.83, 95\% CI 1.65-4.88), and web-based gambling (OR 2.18,
   95\% CI 1.24-3.81).
   Conclusions: A substantial number of adolescents are spending >= 3.5
   hours gaming each day, with almost 1 in 10 (317/3970, 8\%) reporting
   co-occurring gaming and well-being issues. Long hours gaming using
   mobile phones, particularly common in female gamers, may signal poorer
   functioning and indicate a need for additional support. Although
   increased time gaming might be changing how adolescents spend their free
   time and might thus have public health implications, it does not seem to
   relate to co-occurring well-being issues or mental ill-health for the
   majority of adolescent gamers.},

Title = {Learning and Game Based Spectrum Allocation Model for Internet of
   Medical Things (IoMT) Platform},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {48059-48068},
Abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) paradigm provides pervasive
   healthcare services in-home monitoring networks. Nowadays, these
   services play an imperative part in the life of human beings. However,
   excessive requirements of health services result in insufficient
   spectrum resources and service delays. In this study, a novel spectrum
   allocation scheme is proposed for the IoMT system platform. The main
   challenge of our scheme is to effectively share the limited spectrum
   resource while dynamically handling different service requests. To
   achieve a mutually desirable solution for multiple IoMT devices, our
   proposed scheme is designed as a bi-level control algorithm using the
   ideas of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and the
   Balakrishnan-Gomez-Vohra (BGV) solution. At the first level, each IoMT
   device selects its salient point according to the MARL model. At the
   second level, the spectrum resource is distributed through the BGV
   solution, which is implemented by considering the selected salient point
   of each device. Through the sequential interactions of intelligent
   devices, our bi-level control approach can effectively guide individual
   IoMT devices to choose cooperation strategies while optimizing the
   spectrum allocation process. Finally, numerical results show the
   effectiveness of our proposed scheme through the comparisons with
   benchmark protocols. We demonstrate the performance improvement of our
   method in terms of the normalized device payoff, IoMT system throughput
   and device fairness.},

Title = {Examining Young Children's Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviors in
   an Exergaming Program Using Accelerometry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Exergaming has been observed to be a viable supplemental approach in
   promoting physical activity (PA) among children. However, whether sex
   differences in PA and sedentary behaviors exist during exergaming is
   inconsistent. Thus, this study aimed to quantify, via accelerometry,
   young children's PA and sedentary behaviors during exergaming as well as
   examine sex differences in these PA and sedentary behaviors during
   gameplay. In total, 121 first- and second-grade children (mean age =
   6.89 +/- 0.9 years; 73 girls) were included in the analysis. Children
   were a part of a large 18-week parent study. Children wore ActiGraph
   GT1M accelerometers during exergaming play, with four measurements
   purposively selected from the 28 total exergaming sessions to capture
   children's PA and sedentary behaviors during exergaming play. Outcome
   variables included mean percentages of time spent in
   moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), light PA (LPA), and sedentary behavior
   during each exergaming session. One-way ANOVA was performed to determine
   whether there were differences in the percentage of time engaged in
   MVPA, LPA, and sedentary behavior during exergaming by sex.
   Accelerometry data indicated that children's mean percentage of
   exergaming time spent in MVPA, LPA, and sedentary behavior were 19.9\%,
   32.9\%, and 47.2\%, respectively. However, no sex differences were
   present. Observations in this study indicated that boys and girls have
   similar PA levels during exergaming and suggests that features inherent
   to exergaming may assist in PA promotion among both sexes.},

Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Addiction to new technologies (Internet, smartphone and video games) as
   well as cyber-aggression presents a growing incidence at a global level.
   Correlational research is proposed with a sample of n = 127 Costa Rican
   adolescents, with a mean age of 16.32 years, comprising 67 men and 60
   women. The objective was to determine the prevalence of Internet,
   smartphone and video game addiction and its close relationship with
   cyberbullying (cyber-victim role, cyberbully role and mixed role) in the
   Costa Rican context. The results show a high rate of abusive use
   (connection time) of the Internet and ``smartphones{''}, and the
   correlation study, multiple regressions, backward elimination method and
   network analysis show how the behavior of cyberbullies is moderately
   mediated by ``Lack of control of Smartphone{''} and to a large extent by
   ``Avoidance and social problem video games{''}, while that of victims is
   moderately mediated by ``Avoidance and social problem video games{''},
   and is slightly mediated for ``Lack of control of Smartphone{''} and for
   ``Lack of control of Internet{''}. In addition, there is a strong
   relationship between holding both the role of cyber-victim and
   cyberbully, developing feelings of revenge and lack of empathy. The
   practical implications, and the relevance of the socio-demographic and
   social explanatory variables of both phenomena are discussed. It is
   concluded that there is evidence of an explanatory and close
   relationship between the phenomena of cybervictimization,
   cyber-aggression and addiction to the Internet, smartphone and video

Abstract = {Successful emergency vaccination campaigns rely on effective deployment
   and vaccination plans. This applies to localised outbreaks as well as
   for pandemics. In the wake of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, analysis
   of the global Vaccine Deployment Initiative, through which the World
   Health Organization (WHO) donated pandemic influenza vaccines to
   countries in need, revealed that an absence of vaccine deployment plans
   in many countries significantly hindered vaccine deployment. Through the
   Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework adopted by the World Health
   Assembly in 2011, WHO is engaging in several capacity building
   activities to improve pandemic influenza preparedness and response and
   make provisions for access to vaccines and sharing of other benefits.
   The Framework calls for the development and exercise of operational
   plans for deployment of influenza vaccines to enhance pandemic
   preparedness. To this end, WHO has supported the development of
   PIPDeploy, an interactive, in-person table top simulation exercise to
   facilitate learning for emergency preparedness. It employs various game
   design elements including a game board, time pressure, leaderboards and
   teams to enhance participants' motivation. PIPDeploy formed part of five
   WHO Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Deployment Workshops attended by
   national-level managers responsible for pandemic influenza vaccine
   response predominantly in non-producing countries. The purpose of this
   study was to describe the features and application of PIPDeploy, and
   present findings of the evaluation of participants' experiences during
   the simulation involving a ``hot wash{''} discussion and collection of
   quantitative data. The simulation's instructional approach was widely
   accepted by participants, who reported that the format was novel and
   engaging. They reflected on its utility for identifying gaps in their
   own vaccine deployment plans and regulatory frameworks for importation
   of vaccine products. All participants found the simulation relevant to
   their professional objectives. A range of other potential applications
   were suggested, including PIPDeploy's adaptation to sub-national
   contexts and to other epidemic diseases. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier

Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 3},
Abstract = {A blockchain is a distributed general ledger that, after authentication,
   records cryptographic transactions. Consensus algorithms are used to
   record transactions in the general ledger. Consensus algorithms are
   designed to achieve reliability in a network involving untrusted nodes.
   Although several protocols have been in operation for several years,
   they still have drawbacks. Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain
   are two technologies that have received a lot of attention in the last
   decade and are rapidly growing. Fascinating results can be obtained by
   applying AI to solve existing blockchain challenges. Cognitive
   blockchain employs artificial intelligence to improve performance and
   solve its challenges. Cognitive blockchain can perceive network
   conditions, analyze gained knowledge, effectively decide, and adapt to
   improve network performance. CGG, which models distributed systems with
   many simple objects that interact with each other locally, could be a
   suitable learning model for the cognitive blockchain because of the
   distributed nature of the blockchain network. We presented a new
   consensus protocol based on the Cellular Goore Game (CGG) as a cognitive
   model for blockchain consensus that could be used as intelligence
   consensus in the cognitive blockchain. The proposed consensus protocol
   partitions the nodes that take part in the consensus, organizes the CGG
   model to verify a new block after publication, and finally, based on the
   CGG's result, confirms or rejects the block. A new intelligent consensus
   approach improves fault tolerance, scalability, and performance and
   reduces participation costs in consensus for private and consortium
   blockchains. We conduct a qualitative study of the proposed protocol and
   analyze its experimental performance. The results show that the proposed
   schema performs well in the presence of numerous faulty nodes, as well
   as in terms of scalability and throughput.},

Abstract = {Objective To quantify the relationships between youth use of television
   (TV) and other screen devices, including smartphones and tablets, and
   obesity risk factors.
   Study design TV and other screen device use, including smartphones,
   tablets, computers, and/or videogames, was self-reported by a nationally
   representative, cross-sectional sample of 24 800 US high school students
   (20132015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys). Students also reported on health
   behaviors including sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, physical
   activity, sleep, and weight and height. Sex-stratified logistic
   regression models, adjusting for the sampling design, estimated
   associations between TV and other screen device use and SSB intake,
   physical activity, sleep, and obesity.
   Results Approximately 20\% of participants used other screen devices for
   >= 5 hours daily. Watching TV >= 5 hours daily was associated with daily
   SSB consumption (aOR = 2.72, 95\% CI: 2.23, 3.32) and obesity (aOR =
   1.78, 95\% CI: 1.40, 2.27). Using other screen devices = 5 hours daily
   was associated with daily SSB consumption (aOR = 1.98, 95\% CI: 1.69,
   2.32), inadequate physical activity (aOR = 1.94, 95\% CI: 1.69, 2.25),
   and inadequate sleep (aOR = 1.79, 95\% CI: 1.54, 2.08).
   Conclusions Using smartphones, tablets, computers, and videogames is
   associated with several obesity risk factors. Although further study is
   needed, families should be encouraged to limit both TV viewing and newer
   screen devices.},

Title = {Content, Behavior Change Techniques, and Quality of Pregnancy Apps in
   Spain: Systematic Search on App Stores},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Background: Women consult information in mobile apps (apps) during
   pregnancy, and even obstetrics specialists highlight that pregnancy is
   the ideal moment for the use of apps as consultation sources. However,
   the high number of apps designed for pregnancy requires a careful
   assessment to determine their suitability before recommendation.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the apps available in
   Spanish that can be recommended based on their content, behavior change
   techniques (BCTs), and quality as a complementary tool during pregnancy.
   Methods: A systematic search on app stores to identify apps was
   performed in the Apple App Store and Google Play with the subject term
   ``pregnancy.{''} The apps meeting the following criteria were chosen:
   pregnancy-related content, free, and available in Spanish. An app was
   excluded if it was classified as a game or entertainment and thus
   lacking an educational or health aim and if it did not target the
   population under study. The selected apps were downloaded, and their
   quality was assessed using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS),
   with the BCTs included evaluated using the BCT taxonomy version 1 and
   its content.
   Results: A total of 457 apps were identified, 25 of which were
   downloaded for assessment (5.6\%). The median for objective and
   subjective quality was 2.94 (IQR 2.71-3.46) and 1.75 (IQR 1.25-2.25),
   respectively. Regarding content, the median of topics included in the
   apps was 23 (IQR 16-23), with weight gain, nutrition, fetal development,
   and physical activity being the most common. The median number of BCTs
   was 12 (IQR 0.5-3.5). The most frequently identified BCTs in the apps
   were ``Self-Monitoring of Outcomes,{''} followed by ``Goal Behavior{''}
   and ``Instructions.{''} Statistically significant correlations were
   observed between objective quality and content (rho=0.624; P=.001),
   subjective quality and content (rho=0.638; P=.001), objective quality
   and BCTs (rho=0.672; P<.001), subjective quality and BCTs (rho=0.623;
   P<.001), and BCTs and content (rho=0.580; P=.002).
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that only a small
   percentage of free pregnancy apps available in Spanish should be
   recommended. The apps with the best MARS scores were those that
   addressed a higher number of topics and included a higher number of
   BCTs. Those with the best content and quality, and a higher number of
   BCTs included could be recommended by health professionals.},

Journal = {FUTURE INTERNET},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), capable
   of dynamically managing and satisfying the end-users computing demands,
   have emerged as key enabling technologies of 5G networks. In this paper,
   the joint problem of MEC server selection by the end-users and their
   optimal data offloading, as well as the optimal price setting by the MEC
   servers is studied in a multiple MEC servers and multiple end-users
   environment. The flexibility and programmability offered by the SDN
   technology enables the realistic implementation of the proposed
   framework. Initially, an SDN controller executes a reinforcement
   learning framework based on the theory of stochastic learning automata
   towards enabling the end-users to select a MEC server to offload their
   data. The discount offered by the MEC server, its congestion and its
   penetration in terms of serving end-users' computing tasks, and its
   announced pricing for its computing services are considered in the
   overall MEC selection process. To determine the end-users' data
   offloading portion to the selected MEC server, a non-cooperative game
   among the end-users of each server is formulated and the existence and
   uniqueness of the corresponding Nash Equilibrium is shown. An
   optimization problem of maximizing the MEC servers' profit is formulated
   and solved to determine the MEC servers' optimal pricing with respect to
   their offered computing services and the received offloaded data. To
   realize the proposed framework, an iterative and low-complexity
   algorithm is introduced and designed. The performance of the proposed
   approach was evaluated through modeling and simulation under several
   scenarios, with both homogeneous and heterogeneous end-users.},

Abstract = {Virtual reality, as an excellent supportive instructional technology,
   has gained increasing attention from educators and professionals, where
   desktop-based virtual reality (DVR) is broadly adopted due to its
   affordability and accessibility. However, when evaluating students'
   learning experiences such as flow experiences in DVR environments, most
   studies adopt a single construct (the total score of flow experience)
   rather than multiple constructs (enjoyment, engagement, concentration,
   presence and time distortion). This study implemented desktop-based
   virtual reality for a STEM bridge designing program with a total of 254
   undergraduates to investigate the relationship between self-regulation
   skills, five dimensions of flow experience, learning satisfaction and
   continuous intention when engaging in a DVR learning environment. The
   results revealed that self-regulated learning exerted a dominant impact
   on students' learning attitudes in DVR learning, in which students' flow
   experience had a significant mediating effect. Notably, although DVR
   exhibited poor time distortion, higher satisfaction and continuous
   intention were still predicted by the mentality of flow experience (ie,
   enjoyment, engagement, concentration and presence). The findings of this
   study contribute to the consideration of learning experiences and
   attitudes, which has insights for the future design of desktop-based
   virtual reality environments and related instructional activities.
   Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicStudents are
   different in self-regulation skills, which influences their satisfaction
   and continuous intention in learning.Students' self-regulation skills
   are one of the important variables in predicting their flow experience.A
   high level of flow experience contributes to a coherent and efficient
   learning experience within desktop-based virtual reality (DVR)
   environments.What this paper addsStudents' self-regulation skills
   positively predicted their flow experience and satisfaction in DVR
   environments.The components of flow experience (enjoyment, concentration
   and presence) partially mediated the relationship between
   self-regulation skills and satisfaction.Students' self-regulation skills
   indirectly affect continuous intention by the enjoyment and engagement
   of flow experiences.Implications for practice and/or policyWhen
   delivering DVR-based learning activities educators should be supportive
   of students with low levels of self-regulation skills.Emphasis on
   promoting flow experiences such as enjoyment, engagement, concentration
   and presence in designing a DVR-based classroom could enhance student
   satisfaction and continuous intention.Embedding scaffolding or feedback
   in DVR settings would support self-regulated learning and subsequently
   improve student satisfaction and persistence through enhanced flow
   experience.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to systematize the methodological
   foundations for evaluating the effectiveness of marketing communications
   on the Internet. In the literature, there are often limited definitions
   of interactivity, which do not reveal the essence and do not allow fully
   realizing the marketing opportunities associated with its phenomena.
   Today, interactive video, gaming technologies, which are increasingly
   used in the creation of advertising and communication materials, provide
   unprecedented opportunities for users to create and flexibly change
   their own scenarios for the development of events, to guide the history
   of the video and its heroes, which, among other things, makes it
   possible to make the presentation object not only goods or services but
   also the practice of behaviour in different situations of their purchase
   and consumption. In Internet marketing communications, preconditions for
   estimating the time budget, general stay in the network, implementation
   of specific behavioural scenarios of the full-fledged functioning of the
   user as a representative of the target audience, including through
   various devices and due to multimedia character, are formed.

   behaviour analysis becomes possible by the use of cookie data. This
   fragment of data stored on Internet users' computers reveals the broad
   opportunities for enterprises to target their advertising, identifying
   the target audience, for example, by geographic location of users,
   tracking their interests, counting impressions and passing through
   banners. Due to the high level of inherent interactivity, simplification
   of activity realization, and its coordination in a virtual environment,
   with real results, the development of marketing communications on the
   Internet contributes to the transition from the integrated application
   of specialized tools and technologies to their genuine integration.
   These new opportunities, subject to their implementation, will update
   one more aspect - the achievement of the effectiveness of Internet
   communications in marketing. Attempts and methodical options for the
   formation of a holistic set of marketing communications, with their
   declared effectiveness, have become widespread. The author proposes a
   more adaptive system for evaluating the effectiveness of marketing
   communications, where a balanced system of indicators and stages of work
   are complemented by the classical algorithms that create the necessary
   preconditions for preventing or neutralizing the identified problems in
   the organization of Internet marketing communications. The effectiveness
   of the CPM model depends entirely on the derivative results of user
   behaviour (review of site materials, ordering and purchasing goods).
   Therefore, depending on the goals of the campaign, that is, expanding
   the target audience or promoting sales, the result may be more
   predictable. The success of online platforms is based on the consistent
   development of activities, which is harmonized by three benchmarks:
   differentiation, effectiveness, efficiency. If earlier, marketing
   monitoring of the audience and behaviour of Internet users was mainly
   based on the features of its persons or contingents, and the information
   context, today it needs to be integrated (contextual targeting,
   retargeting, and other tools).},

Abstract = {In this paper, we study the individual and organizational learning
   mechanisms leading to the evolution of the division of value between
   economic actors under a given contractual arrangement. Focusing on the
   division of value between a firm and its employees, we theorize that
   following a change in the organizational incentive structure, employees
   learn, over time and with experience, how to be more productive under
   the implied objectives of the incentive regime, as well as how to game
   or exploit it. Results, based on outlet-level data from a Polish
   commercial bank over a 13-month period, show that the bank outlets'
   value creation (sales revenue from primary loans) and value
   appropriation (the sum of outlet employees' monthly bonus) both
   increased, at a decreasing rate, over time as outlet employees gained
   experience under the new incentive regime. In parallel, the bank's share
   (the percentage of value created by outlets retained by the bank)
   increased at first, then, after reaching a plateau, decreased
   continuously, indicating that the ability of the incentive regime to
   induce the intended results evolved, giving rise to an incentive
   life-cycle. In exploring the underlying micromechanisms, we found strong
   quantitative and qualitative evidence for the presence and relative
   paces of productive and adverse learning in bank outlets, as well as for
   the role of prior experience. This is the first empirical study to show
   that individual and organizational learning processes can influence the
   evolution of the division of value between economic actors.},

Abstract = {Purpose Nowadays, cloud platforms are used in many fields, including
   e-commerce, web applications, data storage, healthcare, gaming, mobile
   social networks, etc. However, security and privacy are still two
   significant concerns in this area. The target of this paper is to
   present a system for trust management in industrial cloud computing
   using the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. MCDM
   techniques have been developed to accommodate a wide range of
   applications. As a result, hundreds of approaches have been generated
   with even minor variations on current approaches spawning new study
   fields. Design/methodology/approach Cloud computing provides a fully
   scalable, accessible and flexible computing platform for various
   applications. Due to the multiple applications that cloud computing has
   found in numerous life features, users and providers have considered
   providing security in cloud communications. Due to its distributive
   nature, dynamic space and lack of transparency in performing cloud
   computing, it faces many challenges in providing security. For security
   improvement, trust management can play a very influential role. This
   paper proposes a generic analytical methodology that uses a series of
   assessment criteria to evaluate current trust management testing
   prototypes in industrial cloud computing and related fields. The authors
   utilize a MCDM approach in the present article. Due to the
   multi-dimensionality of the sustainability objective and the
   complexities of socio-economic and biophysical processes, MCDM
   approaches have become progressively common in decision-making for
   sustainable energy. Findings The results of comparing and evaluating the
   performance of this model show its ability to manage trust and the
   ability to adapt to changes in the behavior of service providers
   quickly. Using a simulation, all results are confirmed. The results of
   simulations and evaluation of the present paper indicate that the
   proposed model provides a more accurate evaluation of the credibility of
   cloud service providers than other models. Practical implications The
   number of cloud services and customers is vast and extremely competitive
   in cloud environments, where novel cloud services and customers can join
   at any time, while others can withdraw whenever they want. Because of
   cloud services' highly dynamic and dispersed design, trust management
   mechanisms must be highly flexible to obtain feedback and update trust
   outcomes as quickly as possible. The model presented in this article
   tries to improve users' trust in the cloud industry. Originality/value
   Using a method (MCDM) to find the best trust management solution based
   on user experience in industrial cloud computing is the novelty of this
   paper.},

Title = {Room2Educ8: A Framework for Creating Educational Escape Rooms Based on
   Design Thinking Principles},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {By immersing learners in a playful, interactive, and engaging
   experience, Educational Escape Rooms (EERs) have been found to enhance
   learners' motivation, help them to develop 21st century skills, and
   improve knowledge acquisition. As research into EERs is still in a
   preliminary phase, no unified framework about how to design them has
   been established yet. Additionally, existing frameworks rarely validate
   the quality and efficacy of the frameworks themselves in terms of
   usability and usefulness. Therefore, the present paper proposes
   Room2Educ8, a learner-centred framework for EER design that follows
   Design Thinking principles. It provides detailed heuristics for
   empathising with learners, defining learning objectives and constraints,
   adding narrative, designing puzzles, briefing and debriefing
   participants, prototyping and playtesting, documenting the whole
   process, and evaluating the EER experience. A mixed-methods internal
   validation study based on Instructional Design model validation was
   conducted with 104 postgraduate students between 2018-2022 to assess the
   framework's integrity and use. The study findings suggest that
   Room2Educ8 can be proposed as a valid tool for developing a wide range
   of EER types that cover a variety of topics. Its well-described and
   practical steps make it appropriate for educators regardless of a lack
   of prior experience in EER design.},

Title = {A Simple and Effective Way to Study Executive Functions by Using 360°
   Videos},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {Executive dysfunctions constitute a significant public health problem
   due to their high impact on everyday life and personal independence.
   Therefore, the identification of early strategies to assess and
   rehabilitate these impairments appears to be a priority. The ecological
   limitations of traditional neuropsychological tests and the numerous
   difficulties in administering tests in real-life scenarios have led to
   the increasing use of virtual reality (VR) and 360 degrees
   environment-based tools for assessing executive functions (EFs) in real
   life. This perspective aims at proposing the development and
   implementation of Executive-functions Innovative Tool 360 degrees (EXIT
   360 degrees), an innovative, enjoyable, and ecologically valid tool for
   a multidimensional and multicomponent evaluation of executive
   dysfunctions. EXIT 360 degrees allows a complete and integrated
   executive functioning assessment through an original task for EFs
   delivered via a mobile-powered VR headset combined with eye tracker (ET)
   and electroencephalograms (EEG). Our tool is born as a 360 degrees-based
   instrument, easily accessible and clinically usable, that will radically
   transform clinicians' and patient's assessment experience. In EXIT 360
   degrees, patients are engaged in a ``game for health,{''} where they
   must perform everyday subtasks in 360 degrees daily life environments.
   In this way, the clinicians can obtain quickly more ecologically valid
   information about several aspects of EFs (e.g., planning,
   problem-solving). Moreover, the multimodal approach allows completing
   the assessment of EFs by integrating verbal responses, reaction times,
   and physiological data (eye movements and brain activation). Overall,
   EXIT 360 degrees will allow obtaining simultaneously and in real time
   more information about executive dysfunction and its impact in real
   life, allowing clinicians to tailor the rehabilitation to the subject's
   needs.},

Title = {Robust Bayesian Meta-Analysis: Addressing Publication Bias With

Journal = {PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Meta-analysis is an important quantitative tool for cumulative science,
   but its application is frustrated by publication bias. In order to test
   and adjust for publication bias, we extend model-averaged Bayesian
   meta-analysis with selection models. The resulting robust Bayesian
   meta-analysis (RoBMA) methodology does not require all-or-none decisions
   about the presence of publication bias, can quantify evidence in favor
   of the absence of publication bias, and performs well under high
   heterogeneity. By model-averaging over a set of 12 models, RoBMA is
   relatively robust to model misspecification and simulations show that it
   outperforms existing methods. We demonstrate that RoBMA finds evidence
   for the absence of publication bias in Registered Replication Reports
   and reliably avoids false positives. We provide an implementation in R
   so that researchers can easily use the new methodology in practice.
   Translational Abstract Meta-analysis is an essential tool to synthesize
   information from a series of primary studies. However, the application
   of meta-analysis is often frustrated by publication bias -- the fact
   that statistically significant results are published more often than
   nonsignificant results. To alleviate the problem of publication bias we
   developed a robust Bayesian meta-analysis (RoBMA). RoBMA applies a
   series of meta-analytic models to the data simultaneously and estimates
   the effect size by taking all models into account. RoBMA can quantify
   evidence for the presence as well as the absence of publication bias,
   RoBMA can correct for publication bias in cases where the true effect
   effect size differs between studies, and RoBMA does not require
   all-or-none decisions. We illustrate RoBMA with a meta-analysis on
   violent video games and aggressive behavior, and apply it to the
   ManyLabs 2 data for which we know publication bias to be absent.
   Simulations suggest that RoBMA provides a valuable complement to current
   methods for meta-analysis.},

Title = {Neck kinematics and muscle activity during mobile device operations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Neck pain is a significant health problem due to its high incident rates
   and economic costs. Increased use of touch screen mobile devices is
   becoming pervasive in the modern society and may further influence this
   already prevalent health problem. However, our current understanding of
   the cervical spine biomechanics during the operation of touch screen
   mobile devices is very limited. This study evaluated the neck extensor
   muscle activities and the kinematics of the cervical spine during the
   operation of a touch screen tablet and a smart phone. Three-variables,
   DEVICE, LOCATION and TASK were treated as the independent variables.
   NASA TLX revealed that ``Gaming{''} was the least difficult task and
   ``Typing{''} was the most difficult task. Participants of this study
   maintained significantly deeper neck flexion when operating a smart
   phone (44.7 degrees), with the mobile devices set on a table (46.4
   degrees), and while performing a ``Typing{''} task (45.6 degrees). Lower
   levels of neck muscle activities were observed while performing a
   ``Reading{''} task and holding mobile devices with hand. Lower levels of
   neck muscle activities were also observed when using a smart phone vs. a
   tablet, however such change was statistically insignificant.
   Relevance to industry: The current study demonstrated that users
   maintain deep neck flexion when using touchscreen mobile devices. In the
   recent years, there is an increasing popularity of mobile smart devices
   in various occupational environments. The findings of this study may be
   useful in implementing human-centered task designs to reduce neck injury
   risks among mobile device users. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In recent years, novel mobile applications such as augmented reality,
   virtual reality, and three-dimensional gaming, running on handy mobile
   devices have been pervasively popular. With rapid developments of such
   mobile applications, decentralized mobile edge computing (MEC) as an
   emerging distributed computing paradigm is developed for serving them
   near the smart devices, usually in one hop, to meet their computation,
   and delay requirements. In the literature, offloading mechanisms are
   designed to execute such mobile applications in the MEC environments
   through transferring resource-intensive tasks to the MEC servers. On the
   other hand, due to the resource limitations, resource heterogeneity,
   dynamic nature, and unpredictable behavior of MEC environments, it is
   necessary to consider the computation offloading issues as the
   challenging problem in the MEC environment. However, to the best of our
   knowledge, despite its importance, there is not any systematic,
   comprehensive, and detailed survey in game theory (GT)-based computation
   offloading mechanisms in the MEC environment. In this article, we
   provide a systematic literature review on the GT-based computation
   offloading approaches in the MEC environment in the form of a classical
   taxonomy to recognize the state-of-the-art mechanisms on this important
   topic and to provide open issues as well. The proposed taxonomy is
   classified into four main fields: classical game mechanisms, auction
   theory, evolutionary game mechanisms, and hybrid-base game mechanisms.
   Next, these classes are compared with each other according to the
   important factors such as performance metrics, case studies, utilized
   techniques, and evaluation tools, and their advantages and disadvantages
   are discussed, as well. Finally, open issues and future uncovered or
   weakly covered research challenges are discussed and the survey is

Title = {OMARC: An online multimedia application for training health care
   providers in the assessment of respiratory conditions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {15-24},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objectives: OMARC, a multimedia application designed to support the
   training of health care providers for the identification of common lung
   sounds heard in a patient's thorax as part of a health assessment, is
   described and its positive contribution to user learning is assessed.
   The main goal of OMARC is to effectively help health-care students
   become familiar with lung sounds as part of the assessment of
   respiratory conditions. In addition, the application must be easy to use
   and accessible to students and practitioners over the internet.
   System description: OMARC was developed using an online platform to
   facilitate access to users in remote locations. OMARC's unique
   contribution as an educational software tool is that it presents a
   narrative about normal and abnormal lung sounds using interactive
   multimedia and sample case studies designed by professional health-care
   providers and educators. Its interface consists of two distinct
   components: a sounds glossary and a rich multimedia interface which
   presents clinical case studies and provides access to lung sounds placed
   on a model of a human torso. OMARC's contents can be extended through
   the addition of sounds and case studies designed by health-care
   educators and professionals.
   Validation and results: To validate OMARC and determine its efficacy in
   improving learning and capture user perceptions about it, we performed a
   pilot study with ten nursing students. Participants' performance was
   measured through an evaluation of their ability to identify several
   normal and adventitious/abnormal sounds prior and after exposure to
   OMARC. Results indicate that participants are able to better identify
   different lung sounds, going from an average of 63\% (S.D. 18.3\%) in
   the pre-test evaluation to an average of 90\% (S.D. of 11.5\%) after
   practising with OMARC. Furthermore, participants indicated in a user
   satisfaction questionnaire that they found the application helpful, easy
   to use and that they would recommend it to other persons in their field.
   Conclusions: OMARC is an online multimedia application for training
   health care students in the assessment of respiratory conditions. The
   software integrates multimedia technology and health-care education
   concepts to facilitate learning, while being useful and easy to use.
   Results from a pilot study indicate that OMARC significantly helps to
   improve the capacity of the users to correctly identify lung sounds for
   different respiratory conditions. In addition, participants' opinions
   about OMARC were quite positive: users were likely to recommend the
   application to other persons in their field and found the application
   easy to use and helpful to better identify lung sounds. (C) 2016

Title = {The Design of a Gamified Responsible Use of Social Media},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Social media is part of almost everyone's daily life. Its networking
   facilities redefines the way people connect and interact with each
   other. However, social media is reported being misused in different
   ways, especially the millennials. There is a need to elevate the teens'
   level of empowerment on the responsible use of social media. Other
   technological innovations like augmented reality (AR) and digital
   gamification provides pedagogical benefits. Digital gamification in the
   classroom is a teaching strategy that translates content and delivery
   into a game using digital technology. On the other hand, AR is an
   emerging technology to enlarge real-life situations in multimedia.
   Research shows both technologies increase interactivity well as
   attention span among the learners. Additionally, these technologies,
   including social media, are among the many useful tools in teaching
   twenty first century learners once correctly used. With this, a
   game-based mobile application was developed to advocate responsible use
   of social media among teens. The learning content was gamified in
   augmented reality to provide an innovative teaching and learning way at
   Silliman University. This paper describes the gamification design of the
   learning trail on the topic of responsible use of social media.
   Specifically, it presents the publishing process of the augmented
   reality mobile application about responsible use of social media.
   Kuhlmann's 3C Model (Challenge, Choices, Consequences) was utilized to
   formulate the learning content. It also demonstrates the design phases,
   game mechanics, and the general evaluation of the learning application.
   Four challenges were developed. These are (a) be familiar with security
   and privacy policies, (b) do not express concerns about others, even if
   you think you are anonymous, (c) respond to digital offenders, (d) do
   not tell the world about an upcoming vacation. These challenges were
   translated into graphics and animations. The animated material was
   compiled, programmed, and published to a server of the mobile
   application. The gamified learning trail on responsible use of social
   media is accessible through QR codes leading to the augmented reality
   interface. The design was validated and found to be relevant and
   engaging.},

Title = {The formative value of soccer rules},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN SPORT AND EXERCISE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {S},
Pages = {S656-S663},
Abstract = {The rules of the game of football and the technical and tactical methods
   applicable to them are indispensable for playing sports in a competitive
   way. The correct competition was born from the automatic mechanism of
   the sanction following the violation of a game rule, which is also
   favoured by the relational dynamics of the individual members of the
   group who claim the application of the rule to continue playing. The
   competition can also be self-regulated by the two groups that compete
   for the victory without even the decisive action of the referee, as
   always happens in training activities. This phenomenon is found only in
   those contexts where the rule is necessary and sufficient on its own to
   guarantee the orderly development of the activities. The aim of the
   study is to identify significant elements of the game rules and related
   technical and tactical behaviours in football and to identify an
   inventory of significant behaviours. The method is documentary archival
   research for the analysis of the rules of individual team sports, a
   subsequent comparative method between grids of indicators, descriptors
   and weights that classify rule, technique and tactics. The expected
   results will focus on the appropriate presence of significant elements
   and commonality or discordance. The data are useful for measuring the
   amount of significant behaviours for qualitative processing of the value
   of each of them compared to other current behaviours of quantitative
   performance and for establishing connections. Subsequently, requests for
   self-perception can be administered to practitioners (athletes and
   students) on the specific connections between the need for the rule and
   its application in order to play sportily at the highest levels with
   gratification and satisfaction. The results are useful for any
   reflection and attention to the reproducibility of the mechanism studied
   for other social activities through an educational and training action.},

Title = {Integrating cluster and sequential analysis to explore learners' flow

   context for science courses: A video-based process exploration},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {424-435},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Much emphasis has been placed on the research on applying digital games
   in science education. Among the studies, the advantages and limitations
   of role-playing simulation games deserve further exploration. However,
   existing analyses of the behavioral patterns of role-playing simulation
   games in science education remain substantially lacking, particularly
   the integration of diverse behavioral pattern analysis methods. This
   study thus seeks to analyze the videotaped learning process of 86
   college students in game-based learning activities that utilize a
   role-playing simulation game. This study used the integrated method of
   sequential analysis and cluster analysis and explored the learners' flow
   state and learning behavioral patterns. The results show that the use of
   integrated behavioral pattern analysis helps to explore the traits and
   limitations of role-playing simulation games in science education as
   well as learners' reflective behavior patterns.
   This study identifies a wide variety of learning behavior patterns from
   three potential clusters of learners and then discusses the learning
   process of each cluster. The different levels of flow experienced by the
   learners affected their learning behavior patterns; learners with higher
   levels of flow demonstrated a more in-depth reflective process. The
   study further discusses the results of these analyses and makes relevant
   recommendations for the systems development of the games, its
   educational applications, and evaluation methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {In recent years, the cosplay practice has become a ubiquitous activity,
   representing a pivotal way to get in touch with the so-called geek

   Cosplaying appeared related to narcissistic fragility which in turn is
   strictly linked to social appearance anxiety and self-objectification
   experiences. However, despite the body image centrality in cosplay
   practice, no studies evaluated cosplayers' narcissistic vulnerability in
   association with these body imagerelated issues. A total of 926 young
   adults (73.2\% female; 47.3\% cosplayer; mean age=25.3 years)
   participated in the study. Results confirmed the direct and indirect
   effect of narcissistic vulnerability on social appearance anxiety (via
   body surveillance and body shame) among both cosplayers and
   noncosplayers. Overall, narcissistically vulnerable individuals,
   regardless of their involvement in cosplay practice, seem to experience
   higher body surveillance and body shame, which in turn might promote

   Implications for the prevention of the risk of social exclusion},
Journal = {TEXTO LIVRE-LINGUAGEM E TECNOLOGIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Abstract = {The presence of technologies in all areas and stages of life increases
   the risk of addiction to devices, networks, and the use of various
   programmes. Excessive use of devices and technologies during childhood
   and adolescence has negative effects on neurodevelopment and causes
   emotional disorders related to anxiety, stress, and depression. These
   disorders can be associated with the development of other addictions
   (alcohol, psychoactive substances) or other situations of risk of social
   exclusion such as bullying, among others. In our study of the risk of
   social exclusion in adolescents (aVALOS RUIZ, 2022) we have applied a
   complete diagnostic battery to 25 subjects of both sexes between 12 and
   17 years of age focusing on six dimensions of risk: anxiety and
   depression, alcohol and other substance abuse, bullying, addiction to
   technologies, gender violence and risk behaviour in love and sexual
   relationships, and difficult family situation. The aim of this paper is
   to present and analyse the correlations found between each of the first
   three dimensions, and the technology addiction dimension as a predictor
   of other risk factors for social exclusion. The data show that addiction
   to video games, in particular, is related to high levels of depression,
   while addiction to any of the technologies studied (mobile, internet and
   video games) is significantly related to being a victim of bullying.},

Title = {Media Use and Physical Activity Behaviour of Adolescent Participants in
   Obesity Therapy: Impact Analysis of Selected Socio-Demographic Factors},
Journal = {OBESITY FACTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {307-317},
Abstract = {Background: To address the challenge of juvenile obesity, effective
   therapeutic concepts focusing on lifestyle changes are necessary. A
   relevant aspect is the media use, which is associated with nutrition and
   physical activity patterns and is influenced by socio-demographic
   factors. To optimise obesity therapy, the use of media depending on
   these socio-demographic factors needs to be analysed to adjust the aims,
   content and methods of interventions as well as to harness the potential
   of media use in obesity therapy. The question considered in this
   research is: What media and physical activity patterns show 11- to
   17-year-old obesity therapy participants in dependence on
   socio-demographic factors? Methods: A national multicentre study was
   conducted in 2015. A questionnaire was used to survey 432 participants'
   aged 13.75 +/- 1.4 years. Standardised instruments were used to assess
   the variables: physical activity, media use and socio-demographic
   factors. Results: The participants were 1-hour physically active for 3.9
   +/- 1.9 days/week, 14.1\% daily. Televisions, mobile phones and
   computers were available in all socio-demographic groups and used for 2
   h/day. Socio-demographic differences emerged in the duration of media
   use (h/day). Girls were found to use mobile phones for longer (2.49 vs.
   1.90; p < 0.01) and spend less time on game consoles than boys (0.55 vs.
   1.65; p < 0.01). Conclusion: Compared to current recommendations, the
   sample shows reduced physical activity and increased media use, which
   vary between the groups. Hence, differentiated therapy approaches appear
   recommendable. Future research needs to evaluate, how media (despite its
   risks) can facilitate therapy, training and aftercare concepts. (c) 2018

Journal = {QUANTITATIVE ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We study the estimation of static games where players are allowed to
   have ordered actions, such as the number of stores to enter into a
   market. Assuming that payoff functions satisfy general shape
   restrictions, we show that equilibrium of the game implies a covariance
   restriction between each player's action and a component of the player's
   payoff function that we call the strategic index. The strategic index
   captures the direction of strategic interaction (i. e., patterns of
   substitutability or complementarity) as well as the relative effects of
   opponents' decisions on players' payoffs. The covariance restriction we
   derive is robust to the presence of multiple equilibria, and provides a
   basis for identification and estimation of the strategic index. We
   introduce an econometric method for inference in our model that exploits
   the information in moment inequalities in a computationally simple way.
   We analyze its properties through Monte Carlo experiments and then apply
   our approach to study entry behavior by chain stores where there is both
   an intensive margin of entry (how many stores to open in a market) as
   well as the usual extensive margin of entry (whether to enter a market
   or not). Using data from retail pharmacies we find evidence of
   asymmetries in strategic effects among firms in the industry that has
   implications for merger policy. We also find that business stealing
   effects are less pronounced in larger markets, which helps explain the
   large positive correlation in entry behavior observed in the data.},

Title = {Use of smartphone apps among library and information science students at
   South Valley University, Egypt},
Journal = {ELECTRONIC LIBRARY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {371-404},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the use patterns
   and ownership of smartphone apps among students at the Department of
   Library and Information Science (DLIS) at the South Valley University
   (SVU), Egypt. This study may help faculty members and students, as well
   as DLISs in general and SVU's DLIS, in particular, to understand the
   nature and purpose of such use.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used quantitative research
   methodology in the form of a survey, which was undertaken from February
   to March 2015. The survey instrument was a self-administrated
   questionnaire, with a response rate 82.7 per cent (441/533).
   Findings - The findings of this study showed that smartphone users (82.7
   per cent) at SVU's DLIS tended to be junior females. Smartphone
   non-users (17.3 per cent) tended to be also young females but primarily
   sophomores. The highest percentage of smartphone users had been using
   smartphones for four to five years, and the largest number of students
   was described to be advanced users who heard first about these mobile
   devices through friends and the Web. Most users had 21 to 25 apps.
   Social apps were the most popular and included Facebook, e-mail and
   Twitter. For professional purposes, students used smartphones more for
   communication purposes than learning purposes. Apps related to
   educational purposes included Google Mobile, Facebook, e-mail, Twitter,
   YouTube and Wikipedia Mobile. Students perceived most apps to be easy to
   use and useful to them. There were a number of uses for socializing
   including messaging, following the news and playing games. Students had
   mainly positive attitudes towards apps with a few negative concerns.
   Almost all students confirmed that they trust most apps. Barriers
   related to the use of apps included training and lack of awareness.
   Further research may be needed to specify the relationship between the
   students' use of these apps and their academic performance. The main
   tasks done on smartphone devices were mainly for socializing. Students
   indicated that popular tasks and activities, such as sending and
   receiving messages, following the news, making communications, making
   chat, making friends, finding specific information, finding general
   information, making discussion groups, playing games, completing class
   assignments, checking materials related to courses, doing business,
   seeking jobs, watching movies, listening to music and accessing library
   services are important tasks accomplished by them through the use of
   these devices. The current study indicated very positive attitudes
   towards the use of these apps. Student at least agree with the statement
   that smartphone apps allow for easy dissemination of information,
   provide too much information, increase the speed of finding information,
   help communication, convenient, secure, build confident and reduce paper
   use. However, a large number of students also at least agree with the
   statement that these apps are time consuming, intimidating, addictive,
   violate privacy, require high language and technical skills, harmful and
   frustrating. Almost all students confirmed that they are at least
   trustful in some apps, such as WhatsApp, e-mail, YouTube, Facebook,
   Flickr, Twitter and Viber. A large number of smartphone users surveyed
   in this study have been described to make excessive usage of social
   apps, such as communication apps, messaging/texting apps and social
   networking sites, which were at the forefront of use. Additionally, a
   large number of them adopted these devices, especially for communication
   purposes. The most used apps were Facebook, e-mail, Twitter, WhatsApp,
   YouTube and Viber. For professional purposes, students used smartphones
   more for communication purposes than learning purposes. However, some of
   the students were using some of apps related to educational purposes,
   such as Google mobile, Facebook, e-mail, Twitter, YouTube and Wikipedia
   mobile but not on a regular basis. Students perceived the use of e-mail
   app, Google mobile, Facebook app WhatsApp, Kik, Twitter, YouTube, Google
   maps, Viber, Line, Skype, Tango, Instagram, Flickr and Wikipedia mobile
   as at least fairly easy to them.
   Additionally, they perceived the use of e-mail app Google mobile,
   WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Viber, Instagram, Wikipedia
   mobile, Google maps, Kik, Skype, Line, Tango and Flickr as at least
   fairly useful to them, especially for the purpose socialization more
   than learning.
   Research limitations/implications - This study focuses only on
   undergraduate library and information science students belonging to
   SVU's DLIS, Egypt. Any findings and conclusions resulting from this
   study are limited in scope to only SVU's DLIS's undergraduate students.
   The study does not contain a significantly large sample of a population
   from across Egypt to draw meaningful widespread conclusions indicative
   of such a larger population.
   Practical implications - This study provides valuable insight into the
   use pattern of smartphones among a very important client group. It may
   serve as useful input to researchers who are interested in the study of
   mobile internet technologies (MITs), particularly in the education
   society.
   Originality/value - Being the first study of its kind about university
   students in Egypt, it is considered a pioneering and a unique study
   among studies conducted in the field of ICTs and MITs, especially with
   this category of information users.},

Journal = {MOBILE MEDIA \& COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-75},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mobile dating apps like Tinder became very popular among young adults,
   and, in contrast to mobile dating websites, they were designed to create
   a more game-like experience. While it is well documented that seeking
   entertainment is one core motivation for mobile dating app use, the
   social nature of entertainment has garnered less attention. Therefore,
   in this paper we draw on research on entertainment in dating apps and
   the socio-physical contexts of use to identify patterned behaviors of
   heterosexual users. To do this, we employed a qualitative multi-phase
   research approach. First, we conducted 20 interviews with mobile dating
   app users. Based on the findings from that study, we conducted
   gender-specific focus groups and a discourse analysis to explore the
   social phenomena identified in phase one. Our findings suggest the fun
   of mobile dating is not just interacting with potential matches through
   the apps, but the use of the apps among one's friends. These ``dating
   games{''} are entertaining, but importantly mitigate potential social or
   physical risks of mobile dating. Unsurprisingly, notions of ``play{''}
   across the interview, focus group, and discourse analyses reflect highly
   gendered practices surrounding mobile dating apps and different risks
   associated with such games.},

Title = {Simulation in the Internet age: The place of Web-based simulation in

Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1435-1442},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this article was to review the literature on
   utilisation and place of Web-based simulation within nursing education.
   Web-based simulation combines electronic multimedia options with a
   central video or virtual world to produce interactive learning
   activities mediated by the learner.
   Design: An integrative review.
   Data sources: A search was conducted of healthcare databases between
   2000 and 2014 and of Internet sources for hosted simulation programs in
   nursing. Eighteen primary programs were identified for inclusion.
   Review methods: A strategy for integrative review was adopted in which
   studies were identified, filtered, classified, analysed and compared.
   Results and discussion: Of 18 programs, two game-based programs were
   identified which represented a `virtual world' in which students could
   simultaneously or individually immerse themselves in a character
   role-play. However, most programs (n = 10) taught an aspect of
   procedural patient care using multimedia (e.g. video, audio, graphics,
   quiz, text, memo). Time-limited sequences, feedback and reflective
   activities were often incorporated. Other studies (n = 8) taught
   interpersonal communication skills or technical skills for equipment
   use. Descriptive study outcomes indicated ease of program use, strong
   satisfaction with learning and appreciation of program accessibility.
   Additionally, four studies reported significant improvements in
   knowledge post-intervention.
   Conclusion: Web-based simulation is highly acceptable to students and
   appears to provide learning benefits that align with other simulation
   approaches and it augments face-to-face teaching. Web-based simulation
   is likely to have a major place in nursing curricula in the next decade,
   yet further research is necessary to objectively evaluate learner
   outcomes and to justify its use. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Social behavioural adaptation in Autism},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Author summary
   Autism or AS is mostly characterized by impairments in a very specific
   yet intricate skill set, namely: social intelligence. In this work, we
   focus on ``social reciprocity{''}, i.e. the continuous adaptation of
   one's behaviour that both moulds and appropriately responds to others'
   behaviour. Our working hypothesis is that social reciprocity deficits in
   people with AS derive from a basic inability to tune one's adaptation
   strategy to contextual knowledge about the stakes of social interactions
   (e.g., others' cooperative or competitive incentives). We ask
   participants to engage in simple interactive games with AI agents that
   are endowed with calibrated reciprocal adaptation capabilities.
   Critically, participants are framed to believe either that they are
   competing against somebody else (social framing) or that they are
   playing a gambling game (non-social framing). Only in the social
   condition do participants know about the (competitive) incentives of
   their opponents. Computational analyses of action sequences in the games
   show that, contrary to healthy controls, people with AS do not change
   their strategy according to whether they hold information regarding
   their opponents' incentives or not. In addition, these analyses yield
   79\% diagnosis out-of-sample classification accuracy (AS versus
   controls) and predict 62\% of the severity of social symptoms in people
   with AS. This demonstrates the feasibility of AI-based quantitative
   assessments of social cognition and its deficits.
   Autism is still diagnosed on the basis of subjective assessments of
   elusive notions such as interpersonal contact and social reciprocity. We
   propose to decompose reciprocal social interactions in their basic
   computational constituents. Specifically, we test the assumption that
   autistic individuals disregard information regarding the stakes of
   social interactions when adapting to others. We compared 24 adult
   autistic participants to 24 neurotypical (NT) participants engaging in a
   repeated dyadic competitive game against artificial agents with
   calibrated reciprocal adaptation capabilities. Critically, participants
   were framed to believe either that they were competing against somebody
   else or that they were playing a gambling game. Only the NT participants
   did alter their adaptation strategy when they held information regarding
   others' competitive incentives, in which case they outperformed the AS
   group. Computational analyses of trial-by-trial choice sequences show
   that the behavioural repertoire of autistic people exhibits subnormal
   flexibility and mentalizing sophistication, especially when information
   regarding opponents' incentives was available. These two computational
   phenotypes yield 79\% diagnosis classification accuracy and explain 62\%
   of the severity of social symptoms in autistic participants. Such
   computational decomposition of the autistic social phenotype may prove
   relevant for drawing novel diagnostic boundaries and guiding
   individualized clinical interventions in autism.},

Title = {iSTART StairStepper-Using Comprehension Strategy Training to Game the
   Test},
Journal = {COMPUTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Literacy skills are critical for future success, yet over 60\% of high
   school seniors lack proficient reading skills according to standardized
   tests. The focus on high stakes, standardized test performance may lead
   educators to ``teach-to-the-test{''} rather than supporting transferable
   comprehension strategies that students need. StairStepper can fill this
   gap by blending necessary test prep and reading comprehension strategy
   practice in a fun, game-based environment. StairStepper is an adaptive
   literacy skill training game within Interactive Strategy Training for
   Active Reading and Thinking (iSTART) intelligent tutoring system.
   StairStepper is unique in that it models text passages and
   multiple-choice questions of high-stakes assessments, iteratively
   supporting skill acquisition through self-explanation prompts and
   scaffolded, adaptive feedback based on performance and
   self-explanations. This paper describes an experimental study employing
   a delayed-treatment control design to evaluate users' perceptions of the
   StairStepper game and its influence on reading comprehension scores.
   Results indicate that participants enjoyed the visual aspects of the
   game environment, wanted to perform well, and considered the game
   feedback helpful. Reading comprehension scores of students in the
   treatment condition did not increase. However, the comprehension scores
   of the control group decreased. Collectively, these results indicate
   that the StairStepper game may fill the intended gap in instruction by
   providing enjoyable practice of essential reading comprehension skills
   and test preparation, potentially increasing students' practice
   persistence while decreasing teacher workload.},

   presence in an Arctic archipelago},
Journal = {POLAR RECORD},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {52},
Number = {5},
Pages = {518-534},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Arctic is commonly perceived as a pristine wilderness, yet more than
   four centuries of human industry have not left Svalbard untouched. This
   paper explores the historical dimension of human-induced ecosystem
   change using human presence as a proxy. Its aims are fourfold: to
   reconstruct and quantify historical human presence, to ascertain if
   human presence is a suitable indicator of long-term anthropogenic
   pressure, to deduce trends in anthropogenic pressure on five selected
   species of game animal, and to postulate trends in their subpopulation
   sizes. Published sources give rise to 57 datasets dealing with the
   annual voyages to Svalbard as well as the participants in them. All
   known archaeological sites are visualised in a distribution map. Despite
   the large amount of data, the quantification of historical human
   presence remains biased and partial. Only with the aid of a timeline of
   known milestones is it possible to make hypotheses about changes in
   anthropogenic pressure and animal subpopulations over time. The exercise
   is nonetheless a necessary and instructive one: it confirms that the
   erroneous view of Svalbard as a pristine ecosystem hinders timely
   historical-ecological research. Future work must aim at the systematic
   quantification of past human impact in a holistic approach to
   environmental conservation and restoration.},

Title = {GAME-BASED STUDENT RESPONSE SYSTEM: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF KAHOOT! ON
   JUNIOR AND SENIOR INFORMATION SCIENCE STUDENTS' LEARNING},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {511-553},
Abstract = {Aim/Purpose We aimed to investigate the circumstances under which
   Kahoot! (a Game-based Student Response System (GSRS)) increases junior
   and senior Information Science university students' learning and
   knowledge retention beyond that of traditional teaching methods. We also
   explored whether the positive learning impacts of Kahoot! vary as a
   function of student subject-knowledge (i.e., junior vs senior students).
   Background The effectiveness of game-based student response systems
   (GSRSs) as learning tools in the classroom remains unclear, given
   inconsistent findings across educational research. Kahoot! enhances
   secondary and tertiary students' attention and motivation during class,
   but its effectiveness on learning and retention of course knowledge may
   vary depending on situational and individual factors. In New Zealand
   universities, students spend three years studying towards a Bachelor's
   degree, majoring in subject(s) of their choice. By the end of their
   third year of study, students are eligible to graduate with a sound
   knowledge of their chosen major. Thus, first-year students (referred to
   as ``junior students{''}) and third-year students ({''}senior
   students{''}) may differ in terms of their learning styles and their
   ability and willingness to integrate Kahoot! use into their course work
   and revision. It is hypothesised that differences in subject knowledge
   between junior versus senior students will influence the perceived
   effectiveness of Kahoot!.
   Methodology Thirteen first-year (junior) and fourteen third-year
   (senior) Information Science students (total n = 27), who used Kahoot!
   in seven lectures (for 30 minutes per lecture) were interviewed about
   their perception of Kahoot!'s effectiveness. We conducted a
   mixed-methods case study of students' interview transcripts, demographic
   records and student scores, where thematic (content) analysis was used
   to analyse interview responses. Then, we quantified themes for a one-way
   ANCOVA, with student subject knowledge predicting Kahoot!'s
   effectiveness, when controlling for students' duration of tertiary study
   and study habits (i.e., hours dedicated to course work per week) as
   potential confounders.
   Contribution This study addresses the conflict in existing literature
   around whether GSRSs improve student learning beyond traditional
   teaching methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows
   GSRSs (namely Kahoot!) use improves, or at least, supplements tertiary
   students' learning and knowledge retention of lecture content. This
   study also reveals how student characteristics (i.e., accumulated
   tertiary experience) and their subject knowledge influence the
   effectiveness of Kahoot! as a learning tool.
   Findings Kahoot!'s use increased students' learning and knowledge
   retention, among other positive impacts (e.g., attention and
   engagement). However, the perceived learning impact of Kahoot! was
   greater for senior students. Senior students found Kahoot! more useful
   for learning new knowledge and revising previously acquired knowledge.
   On the other hand, while junior students also experienced positive
   learning impacts using Kahoot!, they reported concerns regarding limited
   and shallow content coverage, and the time-consuming and distracting
   nature of the platform.
   Recommendations for Practitioners Educators should take care to ensure
   GSRSs are appropriately implemented to support rather than replace
   traditional teaching methods (e.g., ``chalk and talk{''} style
   presentations, PowerPoint use). In addition, lecturers using GSRSs
   should clearly inform students about the examinable content and their
   expectations for performance in formal assessments.
   Recommendations for Researchers The positive impact of Kahoot! use on
   students' learning and knowledge retention may be due to stronger
   interactions and engagement during class. Researchers should more
   closely explore how student-lecturer interactions and in-depth
   discussions following GSRS use influence learning. Thus, there is a need
   to reevaluate Malone's (1980) intrinsic motivation theory in relation to
   the ``interactive{''} or ``enjoyability{''} components experienced
   during Kahoot! use.
   Impact on Society The positive impacts of Kahoot! use on student
   learning vary for junior and senior students. However, our findings
   indicate that both cohorts of students benefit from 15-minute Kahoot!
   sessions at the end of a lecture or course unit, allowing them to test
   their knowledge and revise{*} previously taught material. Kahoot!
   provides a comfortable platform that allows students to ask and answer
   questions without embarrassment. More experienced students can also
   evaluate their learning by creating their own Kahoot! quizzes and
   providing feedback to the lecturers. Overall, Kahoot! use could have a
   positive impact on teaching and learning globally.
   Future Research Beyond the recommendation for researchers above, future
   research should explore how differences in lecturers' teaching styles
   and students' self-regulation of learning impact Kahoot!'s effectiveness
   as a learning tool.},

Title = {A Game-Based Learning Approach in Digital Design Course to Enhance
   Students' Competency},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Digital Design is a laboratory course, and the educator must focus on
   the students' need to know why they study the theory and mainly on the
   transition from knowledge-based learning to competency-based learning.
   This study consists of five surveys that were conducted during
   2017-2021. First, we evaluated students' learning outcomes in order to
   define possible learning problems. According to the literature,
   gamification can have a positive impact on students' motivation and
   learning outcomes. Therefore, we used ready-made digital games in order
   to evaluate students' satisfaction and willingness toward their
   integration in the educational process. This process was repeated in the
   next academic year. The feedback we received from the previous surveys
   has helped us to adapt to the new approaches of teaching due to the
   current pandemic caused by COVID-19. We proposed an online holistic
   environment based on Keller's (1987) ARCS model and Malone's (1981)
   motivational model, which was applied in distance learning. Each student
   participated in a student-centered learning experience. He took an
   active role and was self-manager of his learning process. He was given
   the opportunity to develop capabilities and strategies through practice
   and engagement in higher-order cognitive activities, acquire
   self-learning skills, learn how to solve problems, and participate in
   teamwork. This study's innovation is that students experienced a
   combination of learning approaches: (a) a virtual lab consisting of
   simulation-based activities, which allowed students to access new
   laboratory experiences, (b) a project-based digital game without a
   processor, which developed their motivation, creativity, and hands-on
   ability, as opposed to the other relevant studies that use ready-made
   games, and (c) asynchronous videos as feedback, which ensured the
   educator's emotional support and social presence. Finally, this study
   developed research to evaluate the effectiveness of this online holistic
   environment and used a questionnaire, which was created based on
   Keller's Instructional Materials Motivation Survey tool. The results
   showed that its integration in distance learning is probable to motivate
   students to learn and affect positively their attention, relevance,
   confidence, and satisfaction.},

Title = {A survey on the computation offloading approaches in mobile edge
   computing: A machine learning-based perspective},
Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {182},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {With the rapid developments in emerging mobile technologies, utilizing
   resource-hungry mobile applications such as media processing, online
   Gaming, Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR) play an
   essential role in both businesses and entertainments. To soften the
   burden of such complexities incurred by fast developments of such
   serving technologies, distributed Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been
   developed, aimed at bringing the computation environments near the
   end-users, usually in one hop, to reach predefined requirements. In the
   literature, offloading approaches are developed to connect the
   computation environments to mobile devices by transferring
   resource-hungry tasks to the near servers. Because of some rising
   problems such as inherent software and hardware heterogeneity,
   restrictions, dynamism, and stochastic behavior of the ecosystem, the
   computation offloading issues consider as the essential challenging
   problems in the MEC environment. However, to the best of the author's
   knowledge, in spite of its significance, in machine learning-based
   (ML-based) computation offloading mechanisms, there is not any
   systematic, comprehensive, and detailed survey in the MEC environment.
   In this paper, we provide a review on the ML-based computation
   offloading mechanisms in the MEC environment in the form of a classical
   taxonomy to identify the contemporary mechanisms on this crucial topic
   and to offer open issues as well. The proposed taxonomy is classified
   into three main fields: Reinforcement learning-based mechanisms,
   supervised learning-based mechanisms, and unsupervised learning-based
   mechanisms. Next, these classes are compared with each other based on
   the essential features such as performance metrics, case studies,
   utilized techniques, and evaluation tools, and their advantages and
   weaknesses are discussed, as well. Finally, open issues and uncovered or
   inadequately covered future research challenges are argued, and the
   survey is concluded.},

Title = {Biomechanics Associated with Patellofemoral Pain and ACL Injuries in
   Sports},
Journal = {SPORTS MEDICINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {45},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1325-1337},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background Knee injuries are prevalent among a variety of competitive
   sports and can impact an athlete's ability to continue to participate in
   their sport or, in the worst case, end an athlete's career.
   Objective The aim was to evaluate biomechanics associated with both
   patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
   injuries (in sports involving landing, change in direction, or rapid
   deceleration) across the three time points frequently reported in the
   literature: pre-injury, at the time of injury, and following injury.
   Methods A search of the literature was conducted for research evaluating
   biomechanics associated with ACL injury and PFPS. The Web of Science,
   SPORTDiscus, EBSCO, PubMed, and CINAHL databases, to March 2015, were
   searched, and journal articles focused on ACL injuries and PFPS in
   sports that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. The search
   methodology was created with the intent of extracting case-control,
   case, and cohort studies of knee injury in athletic populations. The
   search strategy was restricted to only full-text articles published in
   English. These articles were included in the review if they met all of
   the required selection criteria. The following inclusion criteria were
   used: (1) The study must report lower extremity biomechanics in one of
   the following settings: (a) a comparison of currently injured and
   uninjured participants, (b) a prospective study evaluating risk factors
   for injury, or (c) a study reporting on the injury event itself. (2) The
   study must include only currently active participants who were similar
   at baseline (i.e. healthy, high school level basketball players
   currently in-season) and include biomechanical analysis of either
   landing, change in direction, or rapid deceleration. (3) The study must
   include currently injured participants. The studies were graded on the
   basis of quality, which served as an indication of risk of bias. An
   adapted version of the `Strengthening the Reporting of Observational
   Studies in Epidemiology' (STROBE) guidelines was used to rate
   observational research.
   Results Fifteen journal articles focusing on ACL injuries and PFPS in
   sports met the inclusion criteria. These included three associated with
   both ACL injuries and PFPS across multiple time points. There was
   limited evidence for an association between ankle biomechanics and knee
   injury, with only one ACL injury study identifying decreased plantar
   flexion in association with injury.
   Limitations Only prospective studies can determine biomechanical risk
   factors associated with ACL injuries and PFPS. Case studies and
   case-control studies do not allow for the determination of risk factors
   associated with both ACL injuries and PFPS as there is no certainty
   regarding the presence of the observed biomechanics prior to the onset
   of injury. Further, each study design has its own set of limitations.
   Lastly, the majority of the studies included in this review had adult
   female participants.
   Conclusion By evaluating several different study designs looking at knee
   injuries during high-risk manoeuvres, we were able to obtain a holistic
   perspective of biomechanics associated with PFPS and ACL injuries.
   Looking at different biomechanical research approaches allowed us to
   assess not only the mechanism of injury, but also to look for
   commonalities in biomechanics (in particular, altered frontal plane
   mechanics at the knee and altered sagittal plane mechanics at the knee
   and hip) between injured and uninjured participants pre-injury, at the
   time of injury, and following injury, to better understand potential
   causes of PFPS and ACL injury. Development of injury prevention
   programmes should focus on correcting these mechanics observed across
   the three time points during high-risk manoeuvres as this may help
   decrease the prevalence of ACL injury and PFPS. Programmes focusing not
   only on neuromuscular training, but also skill-specific training focused
   on correcting mechanics during these high-risk manoeuvres may be of
   greatest benefit regarding prevention. Future research should consider
   the impact of cumulative loading on knee injury risk. Additionally,
   better techniques for assessing mechanics in-game are needed in order to
   facilitate injury prevention and screening strategies.},

Pages = {2395-2402},

Abstract = {In this study, the authors formulate a non-cooperative game approach in
   which all base stations compete in a selfish manner to transmit at
   higher power. Each base station in the network is considered as a player
   in the game. The solution of the game is obtained by finding the optimal
   point, namely the Nash equilibrium. The proposed method, named efficient
   handover game theoretic, targets to manage the handover in dense small
   cell heterogeneous networks. Each player in the game optimises its
   payoff by adjusting the transmission power so as to enhance the overall
   performance in terms of throughput, handover, energy consumption, and
   load balancing. In order to choose the preferred transmission power for
   each player, the payoff function takes into account the gain of
   increasing the transmission power, energy consumption, base station
   load, and unnecessary handover. The cell selection is performed using
   the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution
   (TOPSIS). A game theoretical approach is implemented and evaluated for
   dense small cell heterogeneous networks to validate the enhancement
   achieved in the proposed method. Results show that the proposed game
   theoretical approach provides a throughput enhancement while reducing
   the power consumption in addition to minimise the unnecessary handover
   and balance the load between base stations.},

Title = {Development and Psychometric Assessment of the Problematic QQ Use Scale
   among Adolescents},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},

Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The QQ social media platform is very popular among Chinese adolescents.
   As with other social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram,
   YouTube, etc.), there have been increasing reports that the use of QQ
   can be potentially problematic to a minority of users. However, unlike
   these other social media platforms, there is currently no scale to
   assess the risk of problematic QQ use. The present study developed the
   Problematic QQ Use Scale (PQQUS) among Chinese adolescents based on six
   core criteria of behavioral addiction (salience, tolerance, mood
   modification, loss of control, withdrawal, and conflict) that have been
   used in the development of other social media addiction scales. The
   scale was administered to a sample of 1008 Chinese school children to
   assess its psychometric properties, utilizing both classical test theory
   and item response theory. The analysis demonstrated that the PQQUS had
   good item discrimination indices relating to both CTT and IRT. The CFA
   results and Loevinger's H-coefficient suggested the PQQUS had a
   unidimensional factor structure. The PQQUS had good internal
   reliability, good composite reliability, and good concurrent validity
   (based on correlations with measures of anxiety, depression,
   self-esteem, and life satisfaction). The invariance testing between boys
   and girls suggested this scale is a valid assessment tool for both
   groups. Overall, the PQQUS is a psychometrically robust tool for
   assessing problematic QQ use and will have a key role in further
   research on problematic QQ use among Chinese adolescents.},

Abstract = {In this study we consider the scenario of sensors belonging to different
   platforms and owned by different owners that join the efforts in an
   opportunistic way to improve the overall sensing capabilities in a given
   geographical area by forming clusters of nodes. The considered nodes
   have cognitive radio and exploit device-to-device communications. A
   solution is proposed which relies on a Cluster Head (CH) that guides the
   whole task allocation strategy. The addressed challenges are the
   following: i) collaborative spectrum sensing for effective
   communications within the cluster; ii) assignment of each request of
   sensing tasks to a single node in the cluster. The first challenge is
   addressed by proposing a collaborative sensing procedure where each node
   communicates to the CH the received signal energy of licensed users so
   that the latter makes a decision on the availability of the band by
   fusing the received information towards a minimisation of the
   uncertainty in detecting the free spectrum. The second challenge is
   addressed by proposing a non-cooperative Game theory based approach in
   which cluster nodes make effort to selfishly increase utility by winning
   the task. Each node takes part to the competition by considering two
   elements: the gain that is won for its contribution to sensing and for
   the execution of the task (in case it wins the competition); the cost in
   terms of energy to be consumed in case the task is executed. A Nash
   Equilibrium Point (NEP) is found for the aforementioned game in which
   each object has no incentive to deviate uni-laterally from the NEP.
   Extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the impact of
   probability of false alarm, utility function weighting factors and
   presence of licensed users on the cumulative system utility.},

Title = {Shifts in Ecological Dominance between Two Lepidopteran Species in
   Refuge Areas of Bt Cotton},
Journal = {INSECTS},

Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Understanding the reasons that substantiate competitive strategies as a
   result of selective pressure and their consequences for the dynamics of
   competitors under specific conditions is one of the key issues in Game
   Theory. Here, we discuss how the adoption of insecticide control in
   refuge areas and the occurrence of Spodoptera frugiperda and Helicoverpa
   armigera resistance to insecticides could impact the large-scale
   production of individuals in refuge areas of Bt cotton in the context of
   competition dynamics. In view of our results, we emphasize the necessity
   of carefully managing refuge areas of Bt cotton in agroecosystems that
   have both S. frugiperda and H. armigera.
   Competition behavior involving agricultural pest species has long been
   viewed as a powerful selective force that drives ecological and
   phenotypic diversity. In this context, a Game Theory-based approach may
   be useful to describe the decision-making dilemma of a competitor with
   impacts to guarantee its superiority in terms of ecological dominance or
   sharing of the food resource with its competitor. In an attempt to
   elucidate the consequences of competitive dynamics for the ecological
   dominance of these species in refuge areas of Bt cotton, we conducted a
   study that was divided into two parts. The first study consisted of an
   evaluation of interactions involving Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith,
   1797) and Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner, 1808) on non-Bt cotton plants in
   a field trial. In the second study, we explored the data matrix
   collected in the field to parameterize a model of Cellular Automata (CA)
   with update rules inspired by Game Theory. Computer simulations were
   analyzed in hypothetical scenarios involving the application (or not) of
   insecticides in the refuge areas in combination with the resistance
   factor of one or both pest species to the insecticides used in the
   refuge areas. H. armigera had superior competitive performance in
   relation to S. frugiperda only at high densities. According to the
   density-mediated shift in dominance of the species, the resistance of S.
   frugiperda to insecticides is seen as a risk factor for the production
   of susceptible individuals of H. armigera on a large scale in the refuge
   areas. Additionally, S. frugiperda insecticide resistance may
   potentially impact the resistance evolution of the H. armigera
   population to Bt cotton. Thus, ecological dominance could diverge by the
   presence of a resistance allele to insecticides with interspecific
   competition perhaps subordinate to evolutionary processes.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the metabolic demands of Nordic
   walking (NW) versus natural walking (WK) using a highly reproducible
   protocol in a natural environment. A total of 14 physically active
   subjects (3 males and 11 females, 36.6 +/- 8.3years, 63.1 +/- 11.4kg,
   1.67 +/- 0.06m) walked at a freely chosen speed along a 2.5-km course in
   a game reserve, using NW and WK in a random order. They were monitored
   for speed with a mobile phone global positioning system (GPS) receiver,
   and for lap average and maximum heart rate (HR) with a belt HR monitor.
   Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significantly higher lap average HR
   (p=0.004) and maximum HR (p=0.004) in NW compared with WK. Due to its
   increased metabolic load, NW revealed to be an effective means for
   improving cardiovascular fitness in populations with a low tolerance for
   exertion. Using this simple and ecological approach promises to be
   effective for further evaluation of other variables and/or use in other
   contexts (e.g. high altitude and climbing).},

Abstract = {Probiotics are in use for physiological boosting, health supplement, and
   for treatment since historical time. Recently, the to-and-fro pathways
   linking the gut with the brain, explaining the indirect communication
   via modulation of immune function and levels of various
   neurotransmitters, have been discovered, but how precisely these
   modulations alter the levels of neurotransmitters contributing to the
   cognitive and other symptom improvements in patients with schizophrenia
   remains a new arena of research for psychiatry and psychology
   professionals. The germ-free mice experiments have been the game changer
   in the mechanistic exploration. The antimicrobial usage alters the local
   gut flora and hence is associated with psychiatric side effects that
   strengthen the association further. The changes in the genetics of these
   bacteria with different types of diet and its correlation with
   neurotransmitters production capacity and the psyche of the individual
   are indeed an emerging field for schizophrenia research. Redressal of
   issues such as manufacturing, the shelf life of probiotics, and
   stability of probiotics in the gut milieu, in the presence of food,
   secretions, and exact volume needed for particular age group will help
   in refining the dose duration of probiotic therapy. Clinical trials are
   underway for evaluating safety and efficacy in schizophrenia. The gut
   microorganism transplant and pharmacovigilance of probiotics are
   important areas yet to be addressed accurately. This paper elucidates
   the pathways, clinical studies, availability of probiotics in the Indian

Abstract = {Within the framework of digital sustainability, the increase in Internet
   consumption, and especially online social networks, offers social
   benefits, but is not without its drawbacks. For example, it can lead to
   psychological and/or psychiatric disorders in some people. Numerous
   researches are highlighting the similarities of these addictions with
   the consumption of toxic substances. University students are heavy users
   of the Internet and, in certain situations, addiction to online social
   networks can be the result of depression, harassment, and anxiety, among
   others, affecting their daily life, including their academic
   responsibilities. In recent months, an anomaly has occurred that may
   have contributed to intensifying this problem, namely the confinement
   produced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the whole world to
   a greater or lesser extent. In this cross-sectional study, with a
   descriptive and quantitative methodology, students from 14 Spanish
   universities were investigated in the first wave of the COVID-19
   pandemic in order to understand the effects of this situation on the
   problem described. The results show a high consumption of social
   networks during that time, with significant incidences of addiction. In
   parallel, the presence of comorbidity has been determined. In this
   scenario, it would be necessary to implement university educational
   programs to redirect these addictive behaviors, as well as preventative
   recommendations and actions to minimize negative impacts. This is a
   major problem that is growing, exacerbated by the global pandemic
   produced by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Situations of this gravity call
   for the development of preventive and educational measures for the

Abstract = {We conducted a group randomized trial of an interactive, games-based.
   tobacco cessation program (ACTION) designed to help adolescents who live
   in tobacco-growing communities to stop using tobacco. More than 260 high
   school students participated in this study, in 14 schools across three
   states. We collected self-reported measures of cigarette and smokeless
   tobacco use and conducted biochemical validation of self-reported use at
   three time points (pre-test, immediate post-test, and 90-day follow-up).
   We used multi-level modeling to account for intraclass clustering at the
   school and classroom levels, and we analyzed Our results using art
   intent-to-treat approach and a per protocol approach. Using the per
   protocol analytic approach, ACTION participants were more likely than
   comparison participants to achieve abstinence at 90-day follow-up. We
   found no program effects on our secondary outcomes or mediating factors.
   This study suggests that ACTION has promise as a relatively effective
   adolescent cessation program, although the overall limited effectiveness
   of cessation programs for adolescents must be acknowledged. (C) 2009

Abstract = {The need for transparency of predictive systems based on Machine
   Learning algorithms arises as a consequence of their ever-increasing
   proliferation in the industry. Whenever black-box algorithmic
   predictions influence human affairs, the inner workings of these
   algorithms should be scrutinised and their decisions explained to the
   relevant stakeholders, including the system engineers, the system's
   operators and the individuals whose case is being decided. While a
   variety of interpretability and explainability methods is available,
   none of them is a panacea that can satisfy all diverse expectations and
   competing objectives that might be required by the parties involved. We
   address this challenge in this paper by discussing the promises of
   Interactive Machine Learning for improved transparency of black-box
   systems using the example of contrastive explanations-a state-of-the-art
   approach to Interpretable Machine Learning. Specifically, we show how to
   personalise counterfactual explanations by interactively adjusting their
   conditional statements and extract additional explanations by asking
   follow-up ``What if?{''} questions. Our experience in building,
   deploying and presenting this type of system allowed us to list desired
   properties as well as potential limitations, which can be used to guide
   the development of interactive explainers. While customising the medium
   of interaction, i.e., the user interface comprising of various
   communication channels, may give an impression of personalisation, we
   argue that adjusting the explanation itself and its content is more
   important. To this end, properties such as breadth, scope, context,
   purpose and target of the explanation have to be considered, in addition
   to explicitly informing the explainee about its limitations and caveats.
   Furthermore, we discuss the challenges of mirroring the explainee's
   mental model, which is the main building block of intelligible
   human-machine interactions. We also deliberate on the risks of allowing
   the explainee to freely manipulate the explanations and thereby
   extracting information about the underlying predictive model, which
   might be leveraged by malicious actors to steal or game the model.
   Finally, building an end-to-end interactive explainability system is a
   challenging engineering task; unless the main goal is its deployment, we
   recommend ``Wizard of Oz{''} studies as a proxy for testing and
   evaluating standalone interactive explainability algorithms.},

Abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) has been brought closer to the general public over
   the past decade as it has become increasingly available for desktop and
   mobile platforms. As a result, consumer-grade VR may redefine how people
   learn by creating an engaging ``hands-on{''} training experience. Today,
   VR applications leverage rich interactivity in a virtual environment
   without real-world consequences to optimize training programs in
   companies and educational institutions. Therefore, the main objective of
   this article was to improve the collaboration and communication
   practices in 3D virtual worlds with VR and metaverse focused on the
   educational and productive sector in smart factory. A key premise of our
   work is that the characteristics of the real environment can be
   replicated in a virtual world through digital twins, wherein new,
   configurable, innovative, and valuable ways of working and learning
   collaboratively can be created using avatar models. To do so, we present
   a proposal for the development of an experimental framework that
   constitutes a crucial first step in the process of formalizing
   collaboration in virtual environments through VR-powered metaverses. The
   VR system includes functional components, object-oriented
   configurations, advanced core, interfaces, and an online multi-user
   system. We present the study of the first application case of the
   framework with VR in a metaverse, focused on the smart factory, that
   shows the most relevant technologies of Industry 4.0. Functionality
   tests were carried out and evaluated with users through usability
   metrics that showed the satisfactory results of its potential
   educational and commercial use. Finally, the experimental results show
   that a commercial software framework for VR games can accelerate the
   development of experiments in the metaverse to connect users from
   different parts of the world in real time.},

Abstract = {Background and aims: Adolescent Internet gambling is associated with
   concomitant addictive behaviors. This study aimed to assess the
   prevalence of Internet gambling practices, its impact upon psychosocial
   development and to evaluate the association between gambling practices
   and Internet addictive behavior among Cypriot adolescents. Methods: A
   cross-sectional study was conducted in a convenience sample (n = 805) of
   adolescents attending selected public schools (9th and 10th grades) in
   Cyprus. Anonymous self-completed questionnaires were used including the
   Internet Addiction Test and the Strengths and Difficulties
   Questionnaire. Results: Among the study population (n = 805),
   approximately one third (n = 28; 34.9\%) reported Internet gambling.
   Internet gamblers were twice as likely to utilize Internet caf portals
   (adjusted odds ratio for gender and age, AOR: 2.13; 95\% confidence
   interval, 95\% CI: 1.56-2.91) for interactive game-playing (AOR: 6.84;
   95\% CI: 4.23-11.07), chat-rooms (AOR: 2.57; 95\% CI: 1.31-4.85), and
   retrieval of sexual information (AOR: 1.99; 95\% CI: 1.42-2.81). Among
   Internet gamblers 26.0\% (n = 73) reported borderline addictive Internet
   use and 4.3\% (n = 12) addictive behavior. Internet gamblers more often
   had comprehensive psychosocial and emotional maladjustment (AOR: 4.00;
   95\% CI: 1.97-8.13), including Abnormal Conduct Problems (AOR: 3.26;
   95\% CI: 2.00-5.32), Emotional Symptoms (AOR: 1.78; 95\% CI: 1.02-3.11),
   and Peer Problems (AOR: 2.44; 95\% CI: 1.08-5.48) scores. The
   multivariate regression analyses indicated that the single independent
   predictor associated with Internet addictive behavior was Internet
   gambling (AOR: 5.66; 95\% CI: 1.45-22.15). Discussion: Internet gambling
   is associated with addictive Internet use, as well as emotional
   maladjustment and behavioral problems, among Cypriot adolescents.
   Conclusions: Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate whether
   Internet gambling constitutes a risk factor for the development of
   Internet addictive behavior among adolescents.},

Abstract = {Building upon the prevailing concept of edge computing (EC), a
   distributed EC market requires decentralized and verified transaction
   management to trade computing resources. Towards this goal, we study a
   blockchain-aided EC market wherein each data service operator (DSO)
   rents a group of edge computing nodes (ECNs) and leases the ECNs to the
   user terminals (UTs) to provide computation offloading services. A
   trustworthiness model is introduced to evaluate the quality of each
   network entity throughout the transactions. We develop a two-level
   trading mechanism over smart contract to enable the automatic and
   efficient transactions among the network entities and provide high
   quality services. First, we propose a smart contract based matching
   mechanism to establish the renting association between the DSOs and ECNs
   with the aim of maximizing the social welfare. Second, we propose a
   social welfare improved double auction (SWIDA) mechanism to build up the
   leasing association between the DSOs and UTs, and determine the pricing
   of the winners. We show that the proposed double auction mechanism can
   achieve individual rationality, balanced budget, truthfulness in
   expectation, and an improved social welfare than the benchmark
   mechanisms. Moreover, we put forth a trustworthiness driven
   Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to enable verified transaction
   and fair allocation of block generation reward. Following the principle
   of PoS, we formulate the block generation as a coalitional game, wherein
   each stakeholder votes according to its trustworthiness and coinage, and
   shares the reward among the coalition according to the Shapley values.
   The simulation results show that the proposed PoS consensus mechanism
   can reduce the wealth inequality among the network entities compared
   with the conventional consensus mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Background: Clear communication is integral to good clinical care;
   however, communication training is cost and time intensive. Mobile
   applications (apps) may provide a useful adjunct to traditional
   simulation skills training. Objective: To evaluate (1) use of an app for
   teaching communication skills about diagnostic uncertainty, (2) feedback
   on app use, and (3) the association between use and skill mastery.
   Patient involvement: The app under study is designed to improve
   doctor-patient communication. Methods: The study was a planned
   sub-analysis of a randomized controlled waitlist trial with emergency
   medicine resident physicians randomized to receive immediate or delayed
   access to an educational curriculum focused on diagnostic uncertainty.
   The curriculum included a web-based interactive module and the app.
   Metrics describing participants' use of the app, feedback on use, and
   association of use and achieving mastery in communicating diagnostic
   uncertainty are reported. Differences between groups utilizing the app
   were analyzed using Chi-squared test; logistic regression assessed the
   association between app use and achieving mastery of the communication
   skill. Results: Among 109 participants completing the trial, only 34
   (31.2\%) used the app. Most participants engaged with the app on one
   occasion for a median of 50 min (IQR 31, 87). Senior residents were more
   likely to use the app than junior residents (41.3\% vs 23.8\%, p=0.05).
   Overall reviews were positive; 76\% reported the app helped them learn.
   There was no significant association between app use and achieving
   mastery of the communication skill in the trial {[}OR 2.1, 95\% CI
   (0.91-4.84)].Discussion: Despite positive reviews of app use, overall
   use was low and there was no association with achieving mastery.
   Practical value: Offering an app as an auxiliary training opportunity
   may be beneficial to some residents, but shouldn't be planned for use as
   a primary didactic modality unless there is evidence for effectiveness
   and use is mandated. Availability of data and materials: The datasets
   generated and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly
   available since some data may be identifiable but are available from the
   corresponding author on reasonable request. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {A model of risk and mental state shifts during social interaction},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Cooperation and competition between human players in repeated
   microeconomic games offer a window onto social phenomena such as the
   establishment, breakdown and repair of trust. However, although a
   suitable starting point for the quantitative analysis of such games
   exists, namely the Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision
   Process (I-POMDP), computational considerations and structural
   limitations have limited its application, and left unmodelled critical
   features of behavior in a canonical trust task. Here, we provide the
   first analysis of two central phenomena: a form of social risk-aversion
   exhibited by the player who is in control of the interaction in the
   game; and irritation or anger, potentially exhibited by both players.
   Irritation arises when partners apparently defect, and it potentially
   causes a precipitate breakdown in cooperation. Failing to model one's
   partner's propensity for it leads to substantial economic inefficiency.
   We illustrate these behaviours using evidence drawn from the play of
   large cohorts of healthy volunteers and patients. We show that for both
   cohorts, a particular subtype of player is largely responsible for the
   breakdown of trust, a finding which sheds new light on borderline
   personality disorder.},

Title = {Instantly Decodable Network Coding: From Centralized to Device-to-Device
   Communications},
Journal = {IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1201-1224},
Abstract = {From its introduction to its quindecennial, network coding has built a
   strong reputation for enhancing packet recovery and achieving maximum
   information flow in both wired and wireless networks. Traditional
   studies focused on optimizing the throughput of the system by proposing
   elaborate schemes able to reach the network capacity. With the shift
   toward distributed computing on mobile devices, performance and
   complexity become both critical factors that affect the efficiency of a
   coding strategy. Instantly decodable network coding presents itself as a
   new paradigm in network coding that trades off these two aspects. This
   paper review instantly decodable network coding schemes by identifying,
   categorizing, and evaluating various algorithms proposed in the
   literature. The first part of the manuscript investigates the
   conventional centralized systems, in which all decisions are carried out
   by a central unit, e.g., a base-station. In particular, two successful
   approaches known as the strict and generalized instantly decodable
   network are compared in terms of reliability, performance, complexity,
   and packet selection methodology. The second part considers the use of
   instantly decodable codes in a device-to-device communication network,
   in which devices speed up the recovery of the missing packets by
   exchanging network coded packets. Although the performance improvements
   are directly proportional to the computational complexity increases,
   numerous successful schemes from both the performance and complexity
   viewpoints are identified.},

Title = {Pre-primary teachers' preparedness in integrating information and
   communication technology in teaching and learning in Tanzania},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND LEARNING SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {121},
Number = {1/2},
Pages = {79-94},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {Purpose Integration and use of technology in teaching and learning in
   the education sector from pre-primary education (PPE) to the higher
   levels of education, is a policy issue. In developed countries,
   including Tanzania, information and communication technology (ICT),
   especially in PPE, is inadequately researched for laying evidence on its
   applicability in instruction and learning. Therefore, this paper aims to
   determine pre-primary teachers' preparedness in integrating ICT in
   classroom instruction and challenges teachers face in integrating it for
   child's meaningful learning. Design/methodology/approach Methods and
   instruments: a qualitative transcendental phenomenological approach was
   used in determining teachers' preparedness in integrating ICT in PPE in
   Tanzania. It was further used to collect data that describe the teaching
   and learning through the integration of ICT in every session as their
   lived experience for pre-primary teachers. Its selection was appropriate
   as it allowed researchers to systematically analyse for description the
   commonalities and differences existing among the involved teachers in
   integrating ICT in teaching and learning as their lived experiences
   (Moerer-Urdahl and Creswell, 2004). To appropriately analyse teachers'
   understanding and experiences regarding ICT and its integration in
   teaching and learning in pre-primary classes, semi-structured interviews
   and open-ended questionnaires were used for in-depth understanding of
   the study problem. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data
   through open-ended questions where researchers took an average of 40 min
   per session with participants' (teachers) using notebooks to take note
   of their thoughts, feelings and beliefs about ICT integration in PPE.
   Use of the semi-structured interview was based on the reality that it
   provides in-depth information pertaining to participants' experiences
   and viewpoints of a particular topic (Turner, 2010). Once the interview
   session was complete, each teacher was given a questionnaire to fill in
   for triangulating their experiences. Description of participants: a
   total of 14 schools constituting 28 teachers were purposively sampled
   and engaged in this study. Analysis of participants' demographic
   characteristics indicates that all of the involved teachers had
   certificate in teacher education that qualified them as primary school
   teachers. Meanwhile, 18 (66.7 per cent) of the pre-primary school
   teachers who were involved in this study were female with only 10 (33.3
   per cent) had working experience at and above five years of teaching in
   early grade classes. Study participants (teachers) from Itilima and
   Meatu Districts were purposively involved in the study as their
   experiences in young children's learning and contextual influences
   (educational and training policy of 2014, the ICT policy of 2007, and
   foreign studies) are potential in improving the quality of learning.
   Study area: the current study was conducted in two districts (Itilima
   and Meatu) all found in Simiyu region. The two districts were selected
   and considered appropriate by the study as they constituted the 17 most
   disadvantaged rural areas in Tanzania (Mosha et al., 2015). Authors
   describe the two districts as having poor educational outcomes mainly
   relatively low pass rates in the primary school leaving examination
   results. In Itilima, one ward out of 22 was studied in which its six
   schools {[}with a total of 12 teachers] among 87 schools in the district
   were involved.
   While in Meatu district, eight of 121 schools {[}with a total of 16
   teachers] in one ward of 29 wards were studied. This implies that a
   total of 14 schools and 28 teachers were involved in this study. Data
   analysis: the data collected through the interviews and open-ended
   questionnaires were subjected to content analysis procedures (reading
   and re-reading notes and transcripts followed by a three-steps-coding
   process consisting of open, axial and selective coding procedures). The
   analysis process was informed by the Vagle's (2014) six steps for
   phenomenological research data analysis procedure (holistic reading of
   the entire text, first line-by-line reading, follow up questions, second
   line-by-line reading, third line-by-line reading, and subsequent
   readings). Practically, the researchers read and re-read the texts and
   transcribed data from the language used during data collection that is
   Kiswahili, into the reporting language that is English. Following
   transcription, data were coded for developing categories of data through
   axial and elective coding processes. Findings The data analysis was
   conducted and results and its discussion are presented in three
   sub-sections: preparedness of teachers in using ICT in teaching and
   learning; teachers' views about the integration of ICT in teaching and
   learning; and challenges faced by teachers in integrating ICT in
   teaching and learning. Teacher's preparedness in the use of ICT in
   teaching: exploration of teachers' preparedness in integrating ICT in
   teaching and learning was preceded by exploration of teachers'
   understanding of ICT in teaching and learning. Analysis revealed that
   majority of teachers were aware about ICT in teaching and learning and
   they understood it as the implementation of curriculum at school level
   that involves use of ICT-based facilities such as television, mobile
   phones, computer and radio. Teacher elaborated that appropriate use of
   ICT-based facilities that would later develop children to potentially
   improve their understanding and practical application in daily life.
   Other teachers understood ICT in teaching and learning as use of printed
   materials {[}newspapers and magazines] in facilitating pupil's learning
   of planned lessons. While other teachers were aware of what ICT means
   the second category of teachers as noted in their responses, had limited
   understanding, as to them, ICT in education meant use of printed
   materials. Difference in teachers' understanding of the ICT in teaching
   and learning also indicate some teachers viewing it as use of ICT
   facilities in developing children's competencies in the specific
   subject. In the teachers' views, ICT is considered as subject content
   and they delimited their understanding into that perspective ignoring it
   as technological use for facilitating meaningful learning in all
   subjects. Their views are based on the development of children with
   competencies useful in facilitating further learning in the subject
   known as Teknolojia ya Habari na Mawasiliano. Following the question
   based on exploring teachers' understanding of ICT in teaching and
   learning, researchers explored teachers' preparedness in using ICT in
   teaching and learning. Table 1.0 illustrates teachers' multiple
   responses regarding their preparation. Table I: teacher's preparedness
   in using ICT in teaching and learning. S/N; preparedness; freq; and per
   cent. Enhancing child's understanding on the use of ICT-based
   facilities-20, 71.4; using remedial sessions teaching ICT-12, 42.
   8; using ICT-based facilities for teaching other classes-8, 28.5. Table
   1.0 illustrates that teachers are prepared to enable children use ICT to
   access information and more knowledge related to their school subjects
   and general life. They were of the view that ICT could serve well in
   areas where text and supplementary books are scares or torn-out by
   pupils because were poorly bound or due to poor quality of papers used.
   Therefore, availability of ICT facilities in schools would become
   important resource-materials for pupils, as well as teachers. For
   instance, a teacher said that; Availability of ICT facilities, such as
   computers in schools will help us in preparing notes or content for
   supplementing their learning. Different from the paper-based notes,
   computers will keep our notes properly compared to the papers that get
   easily displaced and hard to retrieve notes when lost (Interview, 20
   April 2016). In addition to the use of ICT facilities in serving as
   resource material, their use in schools would aid pupils and teachers to
   use them beyond teaching and learning. Teachers narrated that children
   may find games and puzzles that all help in stimulating their thinking,
   hence interest in schooling and further learning. Teachers also said
   they are prepared to use even extra hours that are beyond school
   timetable to ensure children learn well to meet the uncovered periods
   once facilities are placed in school. Use of extra hours beyond the
   normal school timetable comm.
   Originality/value There is limited empirical evidence about teachers'
   engagement in research particularly in PPE in Tanzania. Together with
   limited research in the level of education, this study is the original
   contribution to state of teachers at the school level about their
   engagement in integrating information and communication technology for
   informing education decision makers and administrators on matters of
   focus to improve educational instruction and implementation of Tanzania
   education and training policy, as well as the implementation of the ICT
   policy of 2016.},

Title = {Impact of some types of mass gatherings on current suicide risk in an
   urban population: statistical and negative binominal regression analysis
   of time series},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {APR 4},
Abstract = {Background: Many studies have investigated the impact of a wide range of
   social events on suicide- related behaviour. However, these studies have
   predominantly examined national events. The aim of this study is to
   provide a statistical evaluation of the relationship between mass
   gatherings in some relatively small urban sub- populations and the
   general suicide rates of a major city.
   Methods: The data were gathered in the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk,
   with a population of 1 million people, in 2005-2010. Suicide attempts,
   suicides, and the total amount of suicide- related behaviours were
   registered daily for each sex. Bivariate and multivariate statistical
   analysis, including negative binomial regression, were applied to assess
   the risk of suicide- related behaviour in the city's general population
   for 7 days before and after 427 mass gatherings, such as concerts,
   football games, and non-regular mass events organized by the Orthodox
   Church and new religious movements.
   Results: The bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses found
   significant changes in some suicide- related behaviour rates in the
   city's population after certain kinds of mass gatherings. In particular,
   we observed an increased relative risk (RR) of male suicide- related
   behaviour after a home defeat of the local football team (RR = 1.32, p =
   0.047; regression coefficient beta = 0.371, p = 0.002), and an increased
   risk of male suicides (RR = 1.29, p = 0.006; beta = 0.255, p = 0.002),
   male suicide-related behaviour (RR = 1.25, p = 0.019; beta = 0.251, p <
   0.001), and total suicide- related behaviour (RR = 1.23 p < 0.001; beta
   = 0.187, p < 0.001) after events organized by the new religious
   movements.
   Conclusions: Although football games and mass events organized by new
   religious movements involved a relatively small part of an urban
   population (1.6 and 0.3\%, respectively), we observed a significant
   increase of the some suicide-related behaviour rates in the whole
   population. It is likely that the observed effect on suicide-related
   behaviour is related to one's personal presence at the event rather than
   to its broadcast. Our findings can be explained largely in terms of
   Gabennesch's theory of the `broken-promises effect'with regard to intra-
   and interpersonal conflict and, in terms of crowd behaviour effects.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN SPORT AND EXERCISE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {S},
Pages = {S645-S655},
Abstract = {The rules of the game of team sports and the technical and tactical
   modalities applicable to them are indispensable for practicing sports in
   a competitive way. The correct competition arose from the automatic
   mechanism of the sanction following the infringement of a game rule
   which is also aided by the relational dynamics of the individual members
   of the group who claim the application of the rule to continue playing.
   The competition can also be self-regulated by the two groups that
   compete for the victory without even the referee's decisive action as
   always happens in training activities. This phenomenon is found only in
   those contexts where the rule is necessary and sufficient on its own to
   guarantee the orderly development of activities. The aim of the study is
   to identify the significant elements of the five-a-side football rules,
   and the related technical and tactical behaviours, to identify an
   inventory of significant behaviours. The method is documentary archive
   research for the analysis of the game rules of the team sport in
   question, and a subsequent comparative method among the grids of
   indicators, descriptors and weights that classify rule, technique and
   tactics. The expected results will focus on the fair presence of the
   significant elements and the commonality or discrepancy between team
   sports. The data is useful to measure the quantity of significant
   behaviours in order to qualitatively elaborate the value of each of them
   compared to the other current behaviours of the quantitative performance
   and to establish the connections.},

Title = {The validity and psychometric properties of the Japanese version of the
   Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS)},
Journal = {BMC PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {Background: Prolonged Internet use is often associated with reduced
   social involvement and comorbid psychopathologies, including depression,
   anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and
   obsessive-compulsive disorder. Asian countries where Internet access is
   widely available have high reported levels of Internet addiction. As
   Internet use has changed drastically since concerns about Internet
   addiction were first raised, the results of recent studies may be
   inaccurate because the scales they employed to measure Internet
   addiction were formulated for different Internet usage from the present.
   It is thus necessary to develop more-up-todate scales to assess
   problematic private use of the Internet.
   Methods: The Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS) was translated into
   Japanese. An online sample whose ages and sexes reflected that of the
   national population of Internet users was recruited to test the scale's
   reliability and validity. Correlations between the scale and
   Internet-related parameters (such as time spent online, motivation for
   going online, and applications used) and psychosocial factors (such as
   psychological distress symptoms and loneliness) were examined.
   Psychometric properties were examined by the split-half method using
   both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Model fits were
   compared across gender.
   Results: CIUS was found to have a high reliability and good concurrent,
   correlation and construct validity. Both exploratory and confirmatory
   factors revealed that the one-factor solution yielded a satisfactory
   result across gender. However, the three-factor structural model in
   which compulsiveness was gauged by ``excessive absorption{''},
   ``difficulty in setting priorities{''}, and ``mood regulation{''} gave
   the best fit of the model for the general population as well as across
   gender.
   Conclusions: Compulsive Internet behavior in Japan can be assessed in
   terms of absorption, priorities, and mood. CIUS is a valid scale for
   screening compulsive Internet behavior in the general Japanese
   population regardless of age and gender.},

Title = {Multiple equilibrium behaviors of auto travellers and a freight carrier
   under the cordon-based large-truck restriction regulation},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The cordon-based large-truck restriction regulation (CBLTRR) makes large
   truck based cargo movement process interrupted because large trucks are
   deterred from moving into some specified areas within given time
   periods. As a result, cargoes carried by a large truck need to be
   transferred from the large truck to small ones at a freight distribution
   center (FDC) for the last few miles. This study aims to analyze the
   multiple equilibrium behaviors for auto travellers and one freight
   carrier under the CBLTRR. A link flow based generalized Nash equilibrium
   (GNE) model is first developed to characterize mixed routing behaviors
   of these two types of users. In the model, auto travellers follow first
   Wardropian principle to find their individual shortest paths, while the
   freight carrier minimizes its total freight cost. We then proceed to
   explore the existence and uniqueness of pure strategy equilibrium, and
   reduction to variational inequality. When the pure strategy equilibrium
   does not exist or is intractable, we propose an approach to construct a
   mixed equilibrium with restricted action space (i.e., the path choice
   set) (called restricted mixed equilibrium). The restricted action space
   is formed based on recurring best-responses of two types of users which
   could reflect their actual interactive decisions of a non-cooperative
   traffic pattern evolution. A solution algorithm is developed to find
   those equilibriums. The developed models and solution algorithms are
   evaluated and their potential applications are illustrated through
   numerical experiments.},

   Emergency Department},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Introduction: Cognitive screening in settings such as emergency
   departments (ED) is frequently carried out using paper-and-pencil tests
   that require administration by trained staff. These assessments often
   compete with other clinical duties and thus may not be routinely
   administered in these busy settings. Literature has shown that the
   presence of cognitive impairments such as dementia and delirium are
   often missed in older ED patients. Failure to recognize delirium can
   have devastating consequences including increased mortality (Kakuma et
   al., 2003). Given the demands on emergency staff, an automated cognitive
   test to screen for delirium onset could be a valuable tool to support
   delirium prevention and management. In earlier research we examined the
   concurrent validity of a serious game, and carried out an initial
   assessment of its potential as a delirium screening tool (Tong et al.,
   2016). In this paper, we examine the test-retest reliability of the
   game, as it is an important criterion in a cognitive test for detecting
   risk of delirium onset.
   Objective: To demonstrate the test-retest reliability of the screening
   tool over time in a clinical sample of older emergency patients. A
   secondary objective is to assess whether there are practice effects that
   might make game performance unstable over repeated presentations.
   Materials and Methods: Adults over the age of 70 were recruited from a
   hospital ED. Each patient played our serious game in an initial session
   soon after they arrived in the ED, and in follow up sessions conducted
   at 8-h intervals (for each participant there were up to five follow up
   sessions, depending on how long the person stayed in the ED).
   Results: A total of 114 adults (61 females, 53 males) between the ages
   of 70 and 104 years (M = 81 years, SD = 7) participated in our study
   after screening out delirious patients. We observed a test-retest
   reliability of the serious game (as assessed by correlation r-values)
   between 0.5 and 0.8 across adjacent sessions.
   Conclusion: The game-based assessment for cognitive screening has
   relatively strong test-retest reliability and little evidence of
   practice effects among elderly emergency patients, and may be a useful
   supplement to existing cognitive assessment methods.},

Title = {A Blockchain Based Truthful Incentive Mechanism for Distributed P2P
   Applications},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {27324-27335},
Abstract = {In distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, peers self-organize and
   cooperate to effectively complete certain tasks such as forwarding
   files, delivering messages, or uploading data. Nevertheless, users are
   selfish in nature and they may refuse to cooperate due to their concerns
   on energy and bandwidth consumption. Thus each user should receive a
   satisfying reward to compensate its resource consumption for
   cooperation. However, suitable incentive mechanisms that can meet the
   diverse requirements of users in dynamic and distributed P2P
   environments are still missing. On the other hand, we observe that
   Blockchain is a decentralized secure digital ledger of economic
   transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial
   transactions and Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies get more and more
   market capitalization. Therefore in this paper, we propose a Blockchain
   based truthful incentive mechanism for distributed P2P applications that
   applies a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin to incentivize users for
   cooperation. In this mechanism, users who help with a successful
   delivery get rewarded. As users and miners in the Blockchain P2P system
   may exhibit selfish actions or collude with each other, we propose a
   secure validation method and a pricing strategy, and integrate them into
   our incentive mechanism. Through a game theoretical analysis and
   evaluation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness and security strength
   of our proposed incentive mechanism.},

Title = {Using faecal glucocorticoid metabolite analyses to elucidate stressors
   of African wild dogs <i>Lycaon pictus</i> from South Africa},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {There are few stressful factors which have been investigated to affect
   adrenocortical function in the African wild dog (AWD) Lycaon pictus.
   Understanding what animals perceive as stressors is important for not
   only the implementation of management practices promoting general animal
   welfare in captivity, but also because a prolonged stress perception is
   known to disrupt reproduction, immune function and ultimately pose a
   threat to survival. In this regard, faecal glucocorticoid metabolite
   (fGCM) measurements are commonly used as a non-invasive approach to
   assess the impact of factors which may be acting as perceived stressors
   in wildlife. This study was aimed at determining if there are
   significant differences in AWD fGCM concentrations as a result of sex,
   presence of absence of an injury, age-class, body condition, dietary
   provisioning (through stable nitrogen (delta 15N) and carbon (delta 13C)
   isotope analysis), hierarchal status, and setting (i.e. captive or
   free-ranging). A total of 47 faecal samples were collected immediately
   post-defaecation from 39 AWDs across four free-ranging sites
   (Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, Madikwe Game Reserve, Kruger National Park and
   the Waterberg), two permanently captive sites (Johannesburg and Pretoria
   Zoo), and four temporary captive holding facilities (Hoedspruit
   Endangered Species Centre and Maremani, Tembe and Zimanga bomas) in
   South Africa. Captive AWDs had distinctively higher fGCM levels than
   their free-ranging counterparts, regardless of sex, body condition,
   hierarchal status, age-class or dietary provisioning. The present study
   is the first to assess physiological stress responses across permanently
   captive, temporarily captive and free-ranging AWDs within the South
   African managed metapopulation, while incorporating the use of stable
   isotope analysis to quantify differences in dietary isotopic profiles
   between these different settings. Ultimately this demonstrates the
   usefulness of fGCM analysis as a tool for assessing animal welfare in
   both captive and free-ranging AVMs, and underpins the importance of
   understanding factors perceived as stressors for the management of the
   species.},

Abstract = {The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Linnaeus 1758, Phasianidae) is
   a common game bird in Europe and it is classified as SPEC 2 (Species of
   European Conservation Concern), that is, a species with unfavorable
   conservation status due to a marked population decline. Loss of suitable
   habitat and hunting management are considered among the major causes of
   its decline. Such a decline can be also related to agriculture
   intensification, changes in agricultural practices and the abandonment
   of less productive lands. Habitat suitability models are an important
   management tool to define the potential distribution range of a given
   species, design a protected area network, and plan appropriate
   management actions and evaluate their effects. This study was conducted
   on Elba Island (Tuscany) in spring 2011 to define the habitat factors
   that affect the A. rufa distribution in a typical Mediterranean
   landscape. On this island the species is declining, as it is in other
   areas of Europe. We carried out point counts in a survey stratified
   according to vegetation. We formulated Resource Probability Selection
   Functions following a presence vs. availability design by Binary
   Logistic Regression Analysis to obtain a map of potential distribution
   of the species. We observed that the red-legged partridge distribution
   was mainly linked to the natural habitat with garrigue and perennial
   meadows, whereas woody landscape had a negative effect. To stop the
   species decline on the island habitat improvement actions are needed,
   such as the cutting of dense vegetation to create open areas.},

Abstract = {The stringent requirements of mobile edge computing (MEC) applications
   and functions fathom the high capacity and dense deployment of MEC hosts
   to the upcoming wireless networks. However, operating such high capacity
   MEC hosts can significantly increase energy consumption. Thus, a base
   station (BS) unit can act as a self-powered BS. In this article, an
   effective energy dispatch mechanism for self-powered wireless networks
   with edge computing capabilities is studied. First, a two-stage linear
   stochastic programming problem is formulated with the goal of minimizing
   the total energy consumption cost of the system while fulfilling the
   energy demand. Second, a semi-distributed data-driven solution is
   proposed by developing a novel multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning
   (MAMRL) framework to solve the formulated problem. In particular, each
   BS plays the role of a local agent that explores a Markovian behavior
   for both energy consumption and generation while each BS transfers
   time-varying features to a meta-agent. Sequentially, the meta-agent
   optimizes (i.e., exploits) the energy dispatch decision by accepting
   only the observations from each local agent with its own state
   information. Meanwhile, each BS agent estimates its own energy dispatch
   policy by applying the learned parameters from meta-agent. Finally, the
   proposed MAMRL framework is benchmarked by analyzing deterministic,
   asymmetric, and stochastic environments in terms of non-renewable energy
   usages, energy cost, and accuracy. Experimental results show that the
   proposed MAMRL model can reduce up to 11\% non-renewable energy usage
   and by 22.4\% the energy cost (with 95.8\% prediction accuracy),
   compared to other baseline methods.},

   Reality},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {36856-36864},
Abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used in gaming, training, and
   health-related applications. However, the level of immersion and
   presence generated by VR can significantly influence the user and the
   achievement of desired outcomes. Therefore, methods to assess levels of
   immersion and presence need to be established. In this paper, we
   investigate the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and saccadic eye movements
   in multiple subjects exposed to VR to determine if VR triggers these
   responses as in real life. Using an HTC VIVE Pro Eye headset and Tobii
   Pro Lab software, we record head and eye movements in response to a 3D
   video of a roller coaster ride. Our results show that critical scenes in
   the video triggered VOR and saccadic eye movements in most subjects,
   indicating a strong correlation between VOR and saccadic eye movements
   during VR immersion. These findings may have implications for the study
   of human behavior and suggest the use of eye movement measures as
   feedback mechanisms during VR experiences.},

Title = {Psychometric Characteristics of a New Scale for Measuring Self-efficacy
   in the Regulation of Gambling Behavior},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Since its introduction in 1977, self-efficacy has proven to be a
   fundamental predictor of positive adjustment and achievement in many
   domains. In problem gambling studies, self-efficacy has been defined
   mainly as an individual's ability to avoid gambling in risky situations.
   The interest in this construct developed mainly with regard to treatment
   approaches, where abstinence from gambling is required. Very little is
   known, however, regarding self-efficacy as a protective factor for
   problem gambling. This study aims to fill this gap, proposing a new
   self-efficacy scale which measures not only the ability to restrain
   oneself from gambling but also the ability to self-regulate one's
   gambling behavior. Two studies were conducted in which the data from two
   Italian prevalence surveys on problem gambling were considered. A total
   of about 6,000 participants were involved. In the first study, the
   psychometric characteristics of this new self-efficacy scale were
   investigated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The
   results indicated the presence of two different factors: self-efficacy
   in self-regulating gambling behavior and self-efficacy in avoiding risky
   gambling behavior. The second study confirmed the replicability of the
   two-factor solution and displayed high correlations among these two
   self-efficacy dimensions and different measures of gambling activities
   as well as other psychological variables related to gambling (gambling
   beliefs, gambling motivation, risk propensity, and impulsiveness). The
   results of logistic regression analyses showed the particular importance
   of self-regulating gaming behavior in explaining problem gambling as
   measured by Problem Gambling Severity Index and South Oaks Gambling
   Screen, thus proving the role of self-efficacy as a pivotal protective
   factor for problem gambling.},

Title = {Group size and decision making: experimental evidence for minority games
   in fish behaviour},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {155},
Pages = {9-19},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Animals tend to learn and make decisions inductively, and simple,
   individual-level behavioural decisions can scale up to yield interesting
   emergent properties at the population level. The minority game is a
   theoretical formulation based on the principle of inductive learning,
   wherein a group of individuals, each facing two equivalent choices,
   self-organize to achieve maximum coordination. Coordination increases
   with memory length up to a certain threshold, and thereafter, at very
   high memory lengths, decisions resemble a random choice game. We invoked
   and observed minority games in guppies, Poecilia reticulata, by forcing
   them to choose between two symmetric chambers in a series of repeated
   trials. At an intermediate timescale, guppies self-organized into a
   globally efficient state featuring maximum coordination. After a large
   number of trials, the guppies approached a steady state in which they
   behaved as if they were randomly choosing between the two chambers.
   Intriguingly, both the time taken to reach this globally efficient state
   (i.e. learning time) and the grouping behaviour for decision making
   depended on the sexual composition of the fish populations. We
   identified a positive correlation between group size and learning time
   in the experiments, which we further explored using simulations to
   uncover the form of decision-making framework at play, testing between a
   leader-based framework and a consensus-based one. Our simulations
   supported the presence of a consensus-based decision-making process in
   the system. This work also provides an unexplored general framework to
   further investigate and understand simple decision-making dynamics and
   structure in animal groups. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of

Journal = {APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {19},

Pages = {235-266},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Virtual environments (VEs) are now becoming a promising new technology
   to be used in the development of interactive learning environments for
   children. Perhaps triggered by the success of computer games, VEs are
   seen as an emergent and engaging new way by which children can learn
   experimental sciences and other disciplines. Inhabiting these IVEs can
   be agents or intelligent characters that are responsible for events that
   happen in the environment and make it not predictive or completely
   controlled. However, to build such environments, in particular, if
   populated by synthetic characters, one needs to carefully address the
   problem of how do the learners respond to the characters in the virtual
   environment. Do learners like the characters? Do learners identify
   themselves with characters in virtual environments? This relation
   between learners and characters in virtual environments can be studied
   in several perspectives. In this paper, we will focus primarily on the
   issue of empathy as one desirable aspect of the affective interaction
   between learners and synthetic characters. In particular, we will defend
   that in order for such affective relations to happen, characters should
   be created and designed taking into account what we call the proximity
   factor. This is based on the fact that children are found to respond
   more empathically to those that are perceived as similar to the self
   than those who are perceived as dissimilar (Barnett 1987). This appears
   to be the case when similarity is defined in terms of a shared
   characteristic, such as sex (Bryant 1982), race or in terms of shared
   personal experiences ( Bryant 1982). Thus, designing characters aiming
   at pedagogical empathic interactions, we should carefully address how
   close the learner will feel with the synthetic characters developed in
   terms of situation, behavior or even physical appearance.
   In order to illustrate this factor in eliciting emotional reactions to
   synthetic characters, we will present a specific system called FearNot!.
   FearNot! was developed to address the difficult and often devastating
   problem of bullying in schools. By using role-playing and synthetic
   characters in a 3D environment, FearNot! allows children from age 8 to
   12 to experience a virtual scenario where they can witness ( in a
   third-person perspective) bullying situations. To build empathy into
   FearNot, we have considered the following components: agent's
   architecture, the characters' embodiment, the environment itself, and
   emotionally charged situations. All these elements were built to allow
   for a stronger proximity with the user and the system. In this paper, we
   will focus primarily on this problem and report some results achieved in
   the evaluation executed with 127 children and 95 adults on the system.},

Abstract = {Pornography is no longer an activity confined to a small group of

   unethical behavior at work. Using survey data from a sample that
   approximates a nationally representative sample in terms of
   demographics, we find a positive correlation between viewing pornography
   and intended unethical behavior. We then conduct an experiment to
   provide causal evidence. The experiment confirms the survey-consuming
   pornography causes individuals to be less ethical. We find that this
   relationship is mediated by increased moral disengagement from
   dehumanization of others due to viewing pornography. Combined, our
   results suggest that choosing to consume pornography causes individuals
   to behave less ethically. Because unethical employee behavior has been
   linked to numerous negative organization outcomes including fraud,
   collusion, and other self-serving behaviors, our results have
   implications for most societal organizations.},

Volume = {15},
Number = {S},
Pages = {S628-S633},
Abstract = {The rules of team sports and the technical and tactical methods
   applicable to them are essential for competitive sports. The correct
   competition is triggered by the automatic mechanism of the sanction
   following the violation of a rule of the game which is also helped by
   the relational dynamics of the individual members of the group who
   demand the application of the rule to continue playing. The competition
   can also be self-regulated by the two groups that compete for the
   victory without even the direct action of the referee as always happens
   in training activities. This phenomenon can be found only in those
   contexts where the rule is necessary and alone sufficient to ensure the
   orderly development of the activities. The objective of the study is to
   identify in the individual team sports the significant elements of the
   rules of the game and the related technical and tactical behaviours and
   to identify an inventory of significant behaviours. The method is the
   documental archive research for the analysis of the rules of individual
   team sports, a subsequent comparative method between grids of
   indicators, descriptors and weights that classify rule, technique and
   tactics. The expected results will focus on the congruent presence of
   the significant elements and the commonality or discordance between team
   sports. The data is useful to measure the quantity of significant
   behaviours in order to qualitatively elaborate the value of each of them
   with respect to the other current behaviours of quantitative performance
   and to establish the connections. Subsequently, self-perception requests
   can be given to practitioners (athletes and students) on the specific
   connections between the need for the rule and its application in order
   to be able to play sportively at the highest levels with gratification
   and satisfaction. The results are useful for possible reflections and
   focus on the reproducibility of the investigated mechanism to other
   social activities through educational and formative action.},

Abstract = {On 28 June 2019, the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) and the European
   Union (EU) concluded the negotiations on the trade chapter of the
   Association Agreement that both blocs had been working on for twenty
   years.The conclusion of the negotiations,announced at the G20 summit in
   Osaka, surprised everyone. They had begun in 1999 but were interrupted
   (and subsequently retaken) on several occasions due to differences in
   key issues such as agriculture, services and government procurement.
   Although a trade agreement was reached in June 2019, we should note that
   this does not mean the end of the process, as ratification by the
   parties and entry into force is still pending.
   At the time of the conclusion of the ``agreement in principle{''}, the
   EU faced the consequences of a multiplicity of overlapping crises and
   concentrated its foreign policy mainly on its eastern and southern
   neighbors, while the South American bloc had diverted its external
   relations to Asia.When everything suggested that MERCOSUR and Europe
   were drifting apart,they managed to reach the agreement What were the
   determining factors for this outcome?
   The explanation of why countries decide to close a trade agreement leads
   to a diversity of factors. In the case of the agreement between MERCOSUR
   and the EU, it was exhibited as an instrument for market access, and as
   an opportunity to increase the well-being and efficiency of different
   economic sectors. From the strategic and geopolitical point of view, the
   agreement was presented as a milestone for the preservation of the
   international liberal order-With regard to the identity element, the
   agreement contributes to the consolidation of a bi-regional common
   identity around a set of shared values.
   The MERCOSUR-EU agreement, then, does not allow a single appraisal, but
   it can be elucidated by the presence of at least three kinds of
   explanatory factors: economic, strategic and geopolitical, and also
   ideational. A large and growing body of literature on international
   cooperation, economic integration and inter-regionalism has investigated
   the selected factors.
   Liberal intergovernmentalists and international political economy
   scholars have studied the interaction between economic and geopolitical
   interests. In the economic integration process, according to these
   approaches,economic interests take precedence. However, they recognize
   that in cases where economic interests are indeterminate or diffuse,
   other objectives might be relevant (such as geopolitical, strategic and,
   we will add, ideational). In this study, we analyze how these three
   factors have been present to account for the agreement reached and what
   their implications are.
   The aim of this research, then, is to investigate the factors that
   explain the conclusion of the agreement between MERCOSUR and the
   European Union, in June 2019, after twenty years of negotiations.
   Similarly, it attempts to examine whether any of these factors have an
   impact on the strategic uses that the parties make of the negotiated
   agreement and its (possible) ratification.
   Our hypothesis is that the conclusion of a deal between MERCOSUR and the
   EU is a multi-causal process involving simultaneously three types of
   factors: economic and trade material interests, strategic and
   geopolitical interaction, and bi-regional identity.The convergence of
   factors implies that the trade-off that allowed the agreement to be
   reached is multivariate, which does not suggest that it is necessarily
   harmonious. Each of these factors contributes to giving a different
   meaning or perspective, making available different strategic uses of the
   agreement by the countries involved.These different uses and meanings
   attributed to the negotiated agreement on the basis of the factors
   involved may also affect the dynamics of the ratification process.
   In methodological terms, the article follows the logic of a qualitative
   case study. The study is longitudinal, seeking to understand the
   conclusion of the negotiations while still considering the phenomenon
   over time. The techniques of data collection and analysis were
   qualitative, relying on the review of official documents, statements and
   speeches of the various actors involved, as well as on secondary
   statistical and bibliographic sources.
   The study shows that multi-causal analyses with eclectic conceptual
   frameworks have advantages, in a context where international trade
   negotiations are becoming more complex and where trade has ceased to be
   a low agenda issue.Therefore, the research carried out makes it possible
   to shed light on the tensions underlying the signing of the agreement,
   which also appear in the ratification process. Moreover, it shows that
   different actors' viewpoints and motivations coexist regarding the same
   international policy event -the trade agreement-.
   This study provides support for our initial argument On the economic and
   commercial dimensions, the parties involved managed to bring their
   positions closer on the most sensitive issues, which -until then-
   appeared as insurmountable differences.While the structural
   characteristics of trade and investment did not change and nor did the
   trade preferences of the sectors, there was a change in the political
   dimension of these elements. From this perspective, the ratification of
   the agreement is imperative, but it is precisely because of the
   sensitivities involved that a higher level of politicization is
   expected.
   Geopolitics has also played a relevant role, especially in the strategic
   use of the announcement of the agreement at the Osaka Summit Thus, it
   was presented as a milestone for the preservation of the international
   liberal order, in contrast to the dynamics of the Sino-American trade
   war.This strategic game, however, is satisfied with the mere
   announcement of the arrangement and the geopolitical variable does not
   generate the same incentives for ratification as it did for the
   conclusion of the negotiations.
   Finally, the explanation based on the identity element is constructed
   from inter-regionalism and makes it possible to argue that the agreement
   between MERCOSUR and the European Union represents a milestone in the
   consolidation of a common identity around a set of shared values.
   However, these are a precondition for the agreement to take place, and
   do not fully explain the 2019 outcome.
   Putting these three variables into dialogue has proved indispensable to
   apprehend the complexity of a long-standing process, and the
   implications of an eventual ratification.These findings, however, raise
   new questions. Future work could enrich the study of the MERCOSUR-EU
   agreement, including the challenges of politicization.Also, since the
   study suggests a link between the three explanatory factors and the uses
   of the trade agreement, in future investigations it might be possible to
   undertake comparative studies between different processes of
   international trade negotiations.
   The article has been organised in the following way. After the
   introduction, the paper goes on to present the definitions related to
   the conceptual framework and research design. In the first section we
   focus on the hypothesis regarding material economic and commercial
   interests.The second section evaluates the geopolitical and strategic
   variable.The third section presents the characteristics and implications
   of the interregional link. Finally, we present the conclusions of the
   investigation.},

Abstract = {The formation of skill of understanding the interlocutor's emotions and
   correcting one's own emotions with regard to a specific communication
   situation, the development of adaptive abilities of the individual
   through emotional interaction with others, as well as the ability to
   predict the resulting failures in various types of social activity,
   should be considered as mandatory conditions for ensuring the success of
   communication.
   To study a peculiar aspect of emotional intelligence formation, a
   research task was set: taking into account the ethno-psychological and
   cultural characteristics of the Chinese audience, to use the phenomenon
   of ``double alienation{''} in order to create a role-playing situation
   that allows one to communicate from another person, removing the
   protective psycho-emotional mechanisms of the Chinese language
   personality; in other words, realizing a ``compulsion to double
   alienation{''}. An important place here is also given to a multi-level
   emotional and communicative reflection, directed both externally and
   internally.
   The hypothesis of the study is to investigate the possibility of using
   emotional intelligence by native Chinese speakers. At the centre of our
   task was the choice of certain forms of work and the construction of the
   educational process in a way that would contribute to the development of
   emotional intelligence of the secondary language personality of Chinese
   students. In order to prove or refute the research hypothesis put
   forward by us, we conducted a formative experiment that allowed us to
   test the methodological innovation and evaluate its impact on the
   parameter under study.
   The following interactive methods for developing emotional intelligence
   were chosen for the experiment: psychological role-playing
   game-discussion using the ``Six Thinking Hats{''} technique developed by
   the famous British researcher Edward de Bono as a system for organizing
   thinking and describing tools for structuring group discussion. The
   technique helps to develop the emotional intelligence of a manager of a
   modern company with international activities and improve interaction in
   multinational project teams.
   Our experiment showed a non-random connection between the inclusion of a
   new method of ``forcing to double alienation{''}, which takes into
   account the ethno-psychological characteristics of participants, and the
   resulting effectiveness, which allowed us to choose it as the optimal
   one for the effective forming of the emotional intelligence of a
   secondary Chinese language personality.},

Title = {Replicator dynamics of public goods games with global exclusion},
Journal = {CHAOS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Studies to date on the role of social exclusion in public cooperation
   have mainly focused on the peer or pool sanctioning types of excluding
   free-riders from the share of common goods. However, the exclusive
   behaviors are not necessarily performed by individuals or local
   organizations but may rather be implemented by a centralized enforcement
   institution at a global scale. Besides, previous modeling methods of
   either peer or pool exclusion often presuppose some particular forms of
   feedback between the individual or collective efforts and the efficiency
   of social exclusion and, therefore, cannot comprehensively evaluate
   their effects on the evolution of cooperation in the social dilemma
   situations. Here, we construct a general model of global exclusion by
   considering the successful construction of the centralized exclusive
   institution as an arbitrary non-decreasing and smooth function of the
   collective efforts made by the global excluders and then theoretically
   analyze its potential impacts in the replicator dynamics of the public
   goods game. Interestingly, we have shown that, despite the presence of
   both the first- and second-order free-riding problems, global exclusion
   can indeed lead to the emergence or even stabilization of public
   cooperation without the support of any other evolutionary mechanism. In
   addition, we have also observed rich dynamical behaviors, such as the
   occurrence of a global or local family of neutrally stable closed orbits
   revolving around a nonlinear center or the existence of stable
   heteroclinic cycles between defectors, cooperators as well as global
   excluders, which give rise to a classification of up to 21 different
   phases. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.},

Title = {Supply network topology and robustness against disruptions - an
   investigation using multi-agent model},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {49},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1391-1404},
Abstract = {In this study we examine the relationship between supply network's
   topology and its robustness in the presence of random failures and
   targeted attacks. The agent-based model developed in this paper uses the
   basic framework and parameters in the experimental game presented in
   Sterman {[}1989, Modeling managerial behavior: Misperceptions of
   feedback in a dynamic decision making context. Management Science, 35
   (3), 321-339] for modelling adaptive managerial decision making in an
   inventory management context. The study extends the linear supply chain
   context to a complex supply network and undertakes a rigorous
   examination of robustness of these supply networks that are
   characterised by distinct network characteristics. We theorise that
   network characteristics such as average path length, clustering
   coefficient, size of the largest connected component in the network and
   the maximum distance between nodes in the largest connected component
   are related to the robustness of supply networks, and test the research
   hypotheses using data from several simulation runs. Simulations were
   carried out using 20 distinct network topologies where 10 of these
   topologies were generated using preferential attachment approach (based
   on the theory of scale-free networks) and the remaining 10 topologies
   were generated using random attachment approach (using random graph
   theory as a foundation). These 20 supply networks were subjected to
   random demand and their performances were evaluated by considering
   varying probabilities of random failures of nodes and targeted attacks
   on nodes. We also consider the severity of these disruptions by
   considering the downtime of the affected nodes. Using the data collected
   from a series of simulation experiments, we test the research hypotheses
   by means of binomial logistic regression analysis. The results point
   towards a significant association between network characteristics and
   supply network robustness assessed using multiple performance measures.
   We discuss the implications of the study and present directions for
   future research.},

Title = {Decision-Theoretic Planning under Anonymity in Agent Populations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {725-770},
Abstract = {We study the problem of self-interested planning under uncertainty in
   settings shared with more than a thousand other agents, each of which
   plans at its own individual level. We refer to such large numbers of
   agents as an agent population. The decision-theoretic formalism of
   interactive partially observable Markov decision process (I-POMDP) is
   used to model the agent's self-interested planning. The first
   contribution of this article is a method for drastically scaling the
   finitely-nested I-POMDP to certain agent populations for the first time.
   Our method exploits two types of structure that is often exhibited by
   agent populations - anonymity and context-specific independence. We
   present a variant called the many-agent I-POMDP that models both these
   types of structure to plan efficiently under uncertainty in multiagent
   settings. In particular, the complexity of the belief update and
   solution in the many-agent I-POMDP is polynomial in the number of agents
   compared with the exponential growth that challenges the original
   framework.
   While exploiting structure helps mitigate the curse of many agents, the
   well-known curse of history that afflicts I-POMDPs continues to
   challenge scalability in terms of the planning horizon. The second
   contribution of this article is an application of the branch-and-bound
   scheme to reduce the exponential growth of the search tree for look
   ahead. For this, we introduce new fast-computing upper and lower bounds
   for the exact value function of the many-agent I-POMDP. This speeds up
   the look-ahead computations without trading off optimality, and reduces
   both memory and run time complexity. The third contribution is a
   comprehensive empirical evaluation of the methods on three new problems
   domains - policing large protests, controlling traffic congestion at a
   busy intersection, and improving the AI for the popular Clash of Clans
   multiplayer game. We demonstrate the feasibility of exact
   self-interested planning in these large problems, and that our methods
   for speeding up the planning are effective. Altogether, these
   contributions represent a principled and significant advance toward
   moving self-interested planning under uncertainty to real-world
   applications.},

Title = {Perspective taking and theory of the mind:: conceptual and empirical
   issues.: A complementary and pragmatic proposal},
Journal = {SALUD MENTAL},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {5-14},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {The present work completes an exhaustive revision of the delimitation of
   the ability of perspective taking from different points of view. First,
   perspective taking is defined as the ability of an individual to
   interpret his/hers emotional and mental states and those of others.
   Additionally, the term has also been used in medical settings to refer
   to a tactic intended to stop certain limiting feeling and/or thoughts
   and instead move feelings and thoughts towards a different direction. At
   the same time, perspective taking is considered to be at the heart of
   psychological phenomena such as empathy, that is, the capacity to
   distinguish what individuals know about themselves in a certain
   situation (how someone thinks, feels and behaves), self-awareness,
   interpersonal relations, and various social skills deficits.
   Second, this ability is conceptualized as a meta-cognition and it is
   assumed that the object of study, is the theory of the mind.
   Third, from a developmental perspective, data have shown that children
   four to five years old, without any psychological disabilities, have the
   ability to take somebody else's perspective. We reviewed different
   studies regarding the development of the abilities to express and
   interpret emotions as precursors to perspective taking.
   Subsequently, we revised and analyzed the tests or strategies most
   commonly used to evaluate the ability of perspective taking. Typically,
   the capacity of an individual to have ``a theory of the mind{''} is
   determined through tests of false beliefs (such as the classic test of
   Sally-Anne, the ``Smarties{''} test, ``M\&M's{''} and the ``Maxi's{''}
   Test). Multiple variations of the tests of false beliefs have been
   conducted with flashcards or photographs, with characters in oral
   stories, and through the use of games. Additionally, over the last few
   years the focus of this body of research has evolved towards the
   elaboration and validation instruments to measure empathy. Among them
   are the tests of Empathy Quotient (EQ), the Friendship Questionnaire
   (FQ), and reading the ``mind{''} in the eyes. It is important to note
   that these efforts have been focused mostly on individuals with
   Asperger's Syndrome or those with higher verbal capabilities.
   From this latter perspective, we propose empirical evidence that points
   out to differences in the ability, of perspective taking between
   children with or without autism. This is also shown in the results of
   previous studies, in which different levels of perspective taking skills
   were seen between children diagnosed with autism, and those diagnosed
   with Down Syndrome. It is important to note that this was not true when
   their verbal skills were not considered as a variable. Like-wise, other
   studies showed that children with autism were not the only ones that
   failed the theory of the mind tests, but that these tests were also
   failed by those children with deficits in language and cognitive skills.
   In this article, we present the results of a study that replicates
   previous findings which show that typical developing children perform
   better in perspective taking tests, followed by children diagnosed with
   Down Syndrome, and subsequently by children with autism. It was also
   noted that the typical developing children showed the highest level of
   verbal discrimination, followed by the children diagnosed with Down
   Syndrome, and finally the children diagnosed with autism. One important
   finding in this study is that all children benefited from the use of
   contextual prompts, which improved the number of correct responses
   across all the theory of the mind tests. Additionally, the data varied
   depending on the type of tests utilized to measure perspective taking
   skills.
   In this article, we have also reviewed the different explanations for
   the origins and development of perspective taking, among which the
   theory of the mind prevails. The ability to take someone else's
   perspective is explained by the development or maturation of an innate
   and specialized module of representations and knowledge, and the
   formation of conceptual structures of a higher order or
   meta-representations. Additionally, the ability to ignore perceptual
   information, salient or not, and to combine simultaneously various
   contexts are considered prerequisites. In other words, perspective
   taking speaks to the relationship between psychological constructs such
   as perception and knowledge. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that
   shared, joint, or independent attention can be a prerequisite for
   conversation, and may be the basis of a theory of the mind. In any case,
   the origins of the development of such a theory have been especially
   ubiquitous in terms of the executive function and possible relations
   with cerebral lesions or alterations. However, some authors consider
   that the process of central coherence may be relatively independent of a
   theory of the mind.
   The research of Baron-Cohen et al. has concentrated on identifying
   existing neurological deficits or organic changes such as bilateral
   lesions or the role of testosterone on the quality of social
   interactions and the restrictive social interests of individuals with
   autism. A similar interest exists in researching the difference in
   perspective taking and empathy abilities exhibited by members of the
   opposite sex. Continuing with the neurological foundations of the
   empathy is of full present time the discoveries regarding <<mirror
   neurons>> and this recent study with monkeys proposes a specific
   cerebral area for the formation of the meta-representation. These
   neurons discharge both when the individual performs an action and when
   the individual observes another person performing the same action.
   Finally, even in the light of all the above, other sources point toward
   the social root of perspective taking skills. Additionally, as indicated
   by the research of Howlin, Baron-Cohen \& Hadwin, it is considered
   perspective. taking includes five different levels: a) simple visual
   perspective taking, b) the knowledge that different individuals can have
   separately the same thoughts, and c) understanding that ``seeing leads
   to learning,{''} followed by d) the ability to predict actions based on
   valid beliefs, and finally e) the ability to predict false beliefs. In
   the light of all of the above, once the radical conclusions of these
   investigations are viewed critically, the theory of the mind is viewed
   as a disputable theory of the delimitation of the cause and development
   of such skills. In addition, to the perspective taking tests themselves,
   the prerequisite skills of perspective taking need to be extensively
   analyzed. In fact, it has been shown that, in order to have an adequate
   performance on these tests of false beliefs, individuals should be able:
   1. to remember and adequately retell their own past desires, thoughts,
   and past actions; 2. to retain an object in their mind, perceive a
   second object, and form a relationship between the two, as in a
   ``symbolic function{''}; 3. to demonstrate the ability to pretend; and
   4. to identify the role of age and verbal abilities in children as
   pre-requisites for an accurate performance on tests of false beliefs,
   and interpretations of the world. Lastly, we propose a pragmatic and
   complementary analysis the Theory of Mind based in the
   functional-contextual analysis of behavior. First, it is considered that
   perspective taking requires or is closely related to other social
   behaviors (such as taking turns when talking, initiating verbal
   responses in interpersonal relations, and the capacity for empathy). In
   the same manner, theory of mind requires an adequate level of simple and
   complex conditional discriminations, and these should be analyzed in
   terms of stimulus control and equivalence relations. In other words,
   this ability to infer thoughts, feeling, and emotions of others exists
   if the following pre-requisites are present: 1. the processes of the
   classical conditioning of the emotions, 2. a generalized imitation, and
   3. the development of functional classes. Without these experiences or
   the capability to be affected by them, children (i.e. children with
   generalized autism) do not develop language adequately. Second,
   perspective taking implies that an observer's previous experiences and
   observations with certain events determine his/her reaction to responses
   emitted by others in similar circumstances.
   Finally, from a contextual perspective, it is considered that a
   speaker's relational frames play a role in this proess (for the
   discriminations I/you, here/there, now/later). These relational
   properties are abstracted through multiple exemplars or multiple
   learning opportunities to speak from one's own perspective in relation
   to others.},

Abstract = {The use of doping agents, once restricted to professional athletes, has
   nowadays become a problem of public health, since it also concerns young
   people and non-competing amateurs in different sports. The use is also
   diffused in social life for improving physical appearance and enhancing
   performance and even dietary supplements assumed to improve performance
   often contain anabolic steroids. While decades ago the so-called
   ``classical doping agents{''} (like stimulants and narcotics) were used,
   to-day anabolic steroids are more widely diffused. Anabolic steroids are
   synthetic substances prepared by introducing modifications in the
   molecular structure of testosterone, the main natural androgenic
   anabolic steroid that forms in testes interstitial cells. The first
   report concerning the use of anabolic steroids by an athlete who
   searched for increased weight and power dates 1954. In 1974 the misuse
   of anabolic steroids in sports was banned by the International Olympic
   Committee and control tests were implemented in 1976 Montreal Olympic
   Games through radioimmunoassay analysis: the technique, however, only
   allows for unspecific detection of a limited number of exogenous
   steroids. Over the years, always new doping substances are synthesized
   and, as a consequence, the list of prohibited compounds is continuously
   updated and new suitable analytical methods for their detection and
   determination in biological matrices are continuously required. In
   doping control analysis the knowledge of steroid metabolism pathway in
   human body is of primary importance and the analytical methods must
   permit the simultaneous detection and determination not only of the
   forbidden precursor agents but also of their metabolites. In addition,
   the potential presence and amount in the biological samples of species
   that can interfere in the analysis should be evaluated. Also the several
   anabolic steroids, specifically designed to circumvent doping control,
   put on the market have been incorporated in the list of the prohibited
   substances of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). In WADA list steroids
   figure in three main classes, namely anabolic steroids, corticosteroids
   and substances with anti-estrogenic properties. It must be strongly
   reminded that assumption of doping agents not only leads to athletes the
   possible failing of doping tests but causes important health risk and
   WADA prohibited list establishes criteria to highlight the alteration of
   the natural steroid profile caused by exogenous administration. Doping
   control analyses are generally performed in urine, a matrix that
   provides a prolonged detection time window, and less often in blood,
   serum, plasma, hair, saliva, and nails. To identify the chemical
   structures of anabolic steroids the use of mass spectrometry detection
   is very advantageous. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
   techniques allowed for the development of comprehensive screening
   methods. GC-MS methods are sensitive and robust but present the
   disadvantages of time-consuming sample pretreatment, that is often based
   on hydrolysis and derivatisation reactions. Liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS) methods have been successfully used to identify and
   determinate steroids in different matrices, as well as to study their
   metabolisms. Nowadays, automatic rapid ultra high performance liquid
   chromatography (UHPLC) tandem mass spectrometry has become the technique
   of choice for steroid analysis.
   Due to its generally higher speed, sensitivity, reproducibility and
   specificity with respect to HPLC, it can be used to simultaneously
   separate and determinate multi component steroid mixtures. The technique
   is of huge interest to separate conjugates anabolic androgenic steroids,
   as it allows efficiency enhancement due to the small particle (sub-2 mu
   m) column packing, which provides high peak capacity within analysis
   times even 5-10 fold shorter than conventional HPLC methods. Modern
   multiplex instruments can analyze thousands of samples per month so
   that, notwithstanding the generally high instrumental costs, the cost of
   the individual assay is affordable. In addition, the improved
   specificity and resolution offered by time-of-flight or quadrupole
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry allow their application in doping
   control analysis or in steroid profiling for accurate and sensitive full
   mass range acquisition. Aim of the present review is to consider,
   compare and discuss the applications of the UHPLC/MS methods present in
   literature for the identification and determination of forbidden
   steroids and their metabolites in human biological matrices. (C) 2012

Title = {A novel technique for stochastic root-finding: Enhancing the search with

Abstract = {The most fundamental problem encountered in the field of stochastic
   optimization and control, is the Stochastic Root Finding (SRF) problem
   where the task is to locate (or in the context of control, to move
   towards), an unknown point r for which g(r)= 0 for a given function g
   that can only be observed in the presence of noise. The vast majority of
   the state-of-the-art solutions to the SRF problem in both stochastic
   optimization and control involve the theory of stochastic approximation.
   The premise of the latter family of algorithms is to operate by means of
   so-called ``small-step{''} processes that explore the search space in a
   conservative manner. Instead of relying on the well-established
   stochastic approximation theory, we rather advocate a radically
   different approach that resorts to principles akin to those used in
   noisy Bisection Search. In deterministic Bisection Search, the main
   question is to determine a point r located on a line by querying an
   Oracle about whether the optimal point x{*} lies to the left or right of
   a point x. A noisy version of this problem, in which the Oracle gives
   the correct response with probability p, was studied by Waeber and his
   colleagues. Inspired by the pioneering work of these authors, and its
   potential application in stochastic optimization and control, we map the
   SRF problem to a noisy Bisection Search problem where we solely use the
   sign information of the samples in order to guide the search.
   Our solution recursively shrinks the search space by, at least, a factor
   of kt at each epoch, where d > 2 is a user-defined parameter of the
   algorithm. Our scheme is based, in part, on the Continuous Point
   Location with Adaptive d-ary Search (CPL-AdS), originally presented by
   Oommen and his co-authors. The solution to the CPL-AdS, however, is not
   applicable here because of the inherent asymmetry of the SRF problem.
   Our solution invokes a CPLAdS-like solution to partition the search
   interval into d sub-intervals, evaluates the location of the unknown
   root e with respect to these sub-intervals using Learning Automata, and
   prunes the search space in each iteration by eliminating at least one
   partition. Our scheme,},

Title = {The mammals of Paracou, French Guiana: A neotropical lowland rainforest
   fauna - part 2. Nonvolant species},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2001},
Number = {263},
Pages = {3-236},
Abstract = {This report describes the results of nonvolant mammal inventory
   fieldwork at Paracou, a lowland rainforest locality in northern French
   Guiana, and concludes the faunal analysis introduced by our previous
   monograph on the bats of Paracou (Simmons and Voss, 1998). Working
   within a 3-km radius over the course of 202 sampling dates from 1991 to
   1994, we recorded a total of 64 nonvolant species by conventional
   trapping, arboreal platform trapping, pitfall trapping, diurnal and
   nocturnal hunting, and interviews with local residents. Included in this
   total species count are 12 marsupials, 9 xenarthrans, 6 primates, 10
   carnivores, 5 ungulates, and 22 rodents.
   Systematic research with nonvolant mammal specimens collected as voucher
   material resulted in the discovery of new taxa, documented range
   extensions of previously described species, and helped resolve many
   longstanding taxonomic problems: (1) Gracilinanus emiliae (Thomas),
   herein reported for the first time from French Guiana, is redescribed
   and its known geographic distribution documented; based on examination
   of type material and original descriptions, G. longicaudus Hershkovitz
   is considered a junior synonym of G. emiliae, but Marmosa agricolai
   Moojen is not. (2) A new genus is proposed for Gracilinanus kalinowskii
   Hershkovitz, a taxon previously known only from eastern Peru, in
   recognition of its trenchant morphological differences from all other
   known didelphimorph marsupials. (3) Marmosops parvidens (Tate) and M.
   pinheiroi (Pine), the latter originally described as a subspecies of the
   former, are distinct species that occur sympatrically at Paracou; based
   on examination of type material, other taxa hitherto synonymized with M.
   parvidens are also judged to be valid species, including M. juninensis
   (Tate) and M. bishopi (Pine). (4) Monodelphis brevicaudata (Erxleben),
   M. glirina (Wagner), and M. palliolata (Osgood) are all distinct species
   diagnosable by unique combinations of morphological traits; based on
   examined specimens, M. brevicaudata (with type locality emended herein
   as Kartabo, Guyana) appears to be endemic to the Guiana subregion of
   Amazonia and to include both bicolored and tricolored phenotypes; a
   neotype from Cayenne, French Guiana, is designated to fix the
   application of Viverra touan Shaw as the oldest available name for the
   tricolored form. (5) Saguinus midas (Linnaeus) and S. niger (E.
   Geoffroy), currently treated as synonyms or conspecific races, are
   unambiguously diagnosable species that do not appear to be sister taxa;
   a neotype is designated to conserve current usage of niger E. Geoffroy
   for the black-handed tamarin of southeastern Amazonia. (6) Two new small
   species of Neacomys are described from material collected at Paracou;
   their diagnostic attributes are documented by detailed comparisons with
   other like-sized con geners from northern South America. (7) Nectomys
   melanius Thomas is recognized as a species distinct from N. squamipes
   (Brants) and N. palmipes J. A. Alien and Chapman; however, N. parvipes
   Fetter is not a valid taxon and is herein synonymized with N. melanius.
   (8) The diagnostic characters of Neusticomys oyapocki (Fetter and
   Dubost), a species previously known only from the holotype, are
   reevaluated and illustrated from freshly collected material. (9) Oecomys
   auyantepui Tate and O. paricola (Thomas), previously treated as
   synonyms, are valid species distinguished by consistent cranial
   differences and occupy allopatric ranges north and south of the Amazon,
   respectively. (10) A critical examination of small Oecomys specimens
   from Paracou and other Guianan localities supports the conclusions of
   other investigators that O. rutilus Anthony and O. bicolor (Tomes) are
   unambiguously diagnosable species. (11) Oligoryzomys fulvescens
   (Saussure) and O.. microtis (J. A. Alien), currently regarded as valid
   allopatric species occurring north and south of the Amazon,
   respectively, are difficult to diagnose unambiguously and may be
   conspecific; new information is provided about the hitherto ambiguous
   type locality of the latter taxon. (12) Rhipidomys nitela Thomas is
   reported from French Guiana for the first time and its previously
   unpublished diagnostic differences from other congeners are tabulated
   and discussed.
   (13) A lectotype is designated for Coendou melanurus (Wagner), and the
   species is redescribed based on all known specimens in North American
   and European museums; diagnostic differences between this: species and
   C. insidiosus (Olfers) are illustrated for the first time. (14) A
   red-rumped agouti (Dasyprocta) is designated as the neotype of Mus aguti
   Linnaeus to preserve current usage of Dasyprocta prymnolopha (Wagler)
   for the black-rumped agouti. (15) The diagnostic differences between red
   and green acouchies (Myoprocta) are discussed and a neotype is
   designated for Cavia acouchy Erxleben to fix the application of that
   name to the red species; other nominal taxa of Myoprocta are identified
   as red or green acouchies based on examination of type material and
   original descriptions. (16) The diagnostic morphological traits of
   Proechimys cuvieri Fetter and P. guyannensis (E. Geoffroy) are
   reevaluated and discussed based on character variation in topotypical
   (French Guianan) material.
   Analyses of our sampling results indicate that distinct sets of
   nonvolant species are effectively sampled by different inventory
   methods, and that increased sampling effort with any method generally
   results in more species. Although the rate of discovery of new species
   always decreases with increasing sample size, none of our graphs of
   species accumulation indicate that an asymptotic value was reached with
   any method. Instead, nonparametric statistical extrapolations suggest
   that the Paracou nonvolant mammal fauna consists of somewhere between 69
   and 74 species; by implication, our nonvolant inventory is about 86-93\%
   complete. Most missing species are probably marsupials and rodents, but
   one or two expected primate species might have been locally extirpated
   by hunters prior to our fieldwork.
   In terms of higher taxonomic composition, the Paracou nonvolant mammal
   fauna is typical of those found throughout the humid Neotropical
   lowlands. However, a quantitative analysis of nonvolant faunal
   similarity at the species level among 12 exemplar rainforest inventories
   first clusters the Paracou list with others from the Guiana subregion of
   Amazonia, next with lists from elsewhere in Amazonia, and lastly with
   Central American lists. Pairwise similarity values likewise show an
   obvious positive correlation between faunal resemblance and geographic
   proximity within the Neotropical rainforest biome. At least 24 species
   (38\%) of the Paracou nonvolant fauna are Amazonian endemics, but 18
   (28\%) are essentially pan-Neotropical in distribution; the remaining 22
   species exhibit a variety of distributional patterns that suggest past
   connections among different sets of currently disjunct rainforested
   regions.
   Species richness comparisons among nonvolant faunal inventories are
   complicated by a variety of familiar problems including inconsistent
   methodology, presence or absence of certain key habitats, and uneven
   sampling effort. A conservative interpretation of sampling results from
   La Selva (Costa Rica), Paracou, and Manu (Peru), however, suggests
   progressive increases in richness of about 23\% from Central America to
   the Guianas, and of about the same amount from the Guianas to western
   Amazonia; over the entire gradient (Central America to western
   Amazonia), the net increase in observed richness is at least 50\%.
   Whereas rodents are consistently the most diverse clade in all
   well-sampled nonvolant faunas, rankings of other orders by relative
   richness exhibit considerable site-to-site variation, at least some of
   which appears to reflect real geographic differences in taxonomic
   diversity rather than sampling artifacts.
   Nonvolant rainforest mammals are hard to classify into trophic guilds
   due to behavioral plasticity and incomplete knowledge of relevant
   natural history. Preliminary guild comparisons among three exemplar
   faunas, however, suggest that the Paracou nonvolant community is
   substantially less diverse in arboreal frugivores and more diverse in
   terrestrial animalivores than are nonvolant communities at some Central
   American and western Amazonian sites. Subsistence and recreational
   hunting has clearly affected local populations of some nonvolant mammals
   at Paracou; whereas popular game species (e.g., large primates) were
   seldom sighted, density compensation may explain high local densities of
   certain other taxa (e.g., Potus flavus and Cuniculus paca). Patterns of
   differential habitat use between closely related nonvolant species at
   Paracou were mostly observed within the terrestrial granivore/frugivore
   guild.
   Combining these results with those previously reported for the sympatric
   bat fauna, we recorded a total of 142 mammalian species at Paracou. By
   statistical extrapolation from our sampling data, the entire local
   community perhaps contains 155-168 species; because the known French
   Guianan rainforest mammal fauna contains at least 167 species for which
   suitable habitat is present in our study area, such estimates are
   plausible. By implication, our inventory is perhaps 85-92\% complete
   overall.
   A synthesis of biogeographic information analyzed in this monograph and
   by Simmons and Voss (1998) suggests that faunal turnover with increasing
   geographic distance is much higher for nonvolant mammals than for bats,
   a necessary consequence of observed group differences in endemicity:
   whereas many nonvolant rainforest mammals have geographic ranges bounded
   by obvious topographic or habitat discontinuities (e.g., large rivers,
   xeromorphic vegetation), most rainforest bats are geographically
   widespread. Not surprisingly, most of the taxa that usefully define a
   Guianan center of mammalian endemism are nonvolant species. The
   geographic limits of Guianan endemism appear to be remarkably similar
   for mammals, birds, snakes, lizards, and trees, suggesting a common
   pattern of biotic differentiation.
   Overall, the Paracou mammal fauna conforms broadly with previous
   generalizations about community-wide patterns of diel activity and
   substrate use by Neotropical rainforest mammals, but appears to diverge
   significantly from conventional views about trophic structure. Whereas
   there are many more species of secondary consumers than primary
   consumers at Paracou, primary consumers appear to outnumber secondary
   consumers by an equally large margin at some western Amazonian inventory
   sites. Sampling artifacts perhaps explain some of the community
   differences observed in such comparisons, but real geographic variation
   in trophic structure is also apparent.},
